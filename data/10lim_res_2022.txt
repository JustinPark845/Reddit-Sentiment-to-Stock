What will be the catalyst even be this time?"*   \nFuck would I know what Ryan Cohen is cooking. (NFT Marketplace???) But this voodoo astrology can smell the tendies he is about to serve. \n\nHere. [Check a look at the amazing TA with GME sitting comfortably on the 2021 YTD VWAP](https://i.imgur.com/xl6BvYo.jpg).  \n\n*Look at all those triangles. Mooooooon tomorrow!!!*  \n\nYou don\'t make financial decisions based on shapes do you? Well instead of displaying to you how two lines on a chart form a triangle, this DD will draw you lines but wrapped with theoretical bullshit containing Wyckoff Method, IV percentile, and Nancy Pelosi. \n\n## First, go educate yourself about the [Wyckoff Method](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:the_wyckoff_method).\n\nYeah, I wouldn\'t read that long ass article either.  \nIn short, the market can be understood and anticipated through analysis of supply and demand. Price cycles through accumulation, markup, distribution, and then markdown. Accumulation and distribution events can be illustrated in certain patterns. \n\n[Picture](https://i.imgur.com/XX369Uf.png)\n\nThis method was developed by Richard Wyckoff a century ago, who realized that stock price trends were driven primarily by institutional and other large operators who manipulate stock prices in their favor. Using Wyckoff\'s method, one can invest in stocks by capitalizing on the intentions of the large “smart money” interests, rather than being caught on the wrong side of the market.\n\nTwo patterns to know that your brain will filter regardless: [wrinkle1](https://i.imgur.com/HnRoUVN.png) , [wrinkle2](https://i.imgur.com/MCx85wM.png)\n\n*"This Wackoff Method sounds some fringe TA/astrology mumbo jumbo."*  \nIt sure is. Yet 100 years later, these tried and true accumulation/distribution patterns can still be observed today. \n\n1. [This guy predicted the May selloff with Wyckoff](https://i.imgur.com/WnlEuk4.jpg)\n\n2. [Scored one of my best wins last year in the fall thanks to Wyckoff](https://i.imgur.com/1ztCaoj.png)\n\n- [Now with our favorite stock](https://i.imgur.com/AmhdX8O.png)\n\nI believe GME has just completed a spring/shakeout and the trend will gradually become bullish. Spring is a definitive test of available supply before a markup campaign unfolds. It may occur once a price advance has started, with rapid downward movement intended to induce retail traders and investors in long positions to sell their shares to large operators at bargain prices.   \nBut then again, I am a expert at wacking off, not Wyckoff.\n\n*"Retail owns the float shill. Why would the hedgies want GME to rocket. It is us against the corrupt and fraudalent financial markets from the SEC to the DTCC."*  \nI agree fuck the gay bears and naked short selling. However, if you believe this is some David vs Goliath story like the media said in January, keep drinking that Koolaid. \n\n*"Institutions don\'t move/manipulate stock prices. You\'re spewing conspiracy crap."*    \nYou must be from the same herd of sheep who believed WSB was the one to squeeze silver last February.   \n \n*"GME moves in cycles bro, not some Wackoff baloney."*  \nIs GME a tampon? You shove GME in your portfolio one week, and then leave it out the next three?   \nTo be fair, I am not familiar with market mechanics such as FTD cycles. If the cycles have merit, then I would hope the next bullish momentum in phase D of Wyckoff aligns with the next cycle. \n\n##Low IV percentile typically provides a optimal environment for institutional sharks to feed.  \n\nMost of the time, institutions aren\'t retarded like us. Most of the time. We ape into otm FDs on earnings day just to watch them get stomped on by IV the next day. Institutions buy options when the IV percentile is at or near the lowest, because that is when they are at a discount. \n\nCoincidentally when a stock\'s IV percentile is at its lowest, retail is the most bearish. A stock at a low IV percentile normally is consolidating and will starfish. Not talking about the sea creature. So the stock price lays flat, unmoving, and retail tends to get bored. They then pull out of their long positions to pump some hot flavor of the month stock with high IV. Meanwhile, institutions continue to add to their position. Hence inverse retail is a known strategy.\n\nTheta gang finds this amusing though. So if any theta gang comes across this, fuck you you milquetoast asshats.  \n\nMajority retail has become bearish on GME, which has starfished around the $180-$200 area for most of the year with a few spasms of volatility. Of course there remains a few enthusiasts, but let\'s just lock those animals up in a cage where they belong. If you talk to folk aside from them, most would say the stock is dead. In the past year, retail has been turned off to GME due to a combination of media bombardment of "forget GME" stories, getting burned by GME\'s volatility and new-age meme(scam) stocks like CLOV, and the fanaticism of QME members. \n\nIt just so happens GME and other meme stocks are at or near their lowest IV percentile of the past year. Everything in the market moves in cycles. Periods of low volatility will become periods of high volatility. Here are a few examples last year:\n\n1. [Tesla in the summer before the run to the $1000](https://i.imgur.com/jLIrA3L.png)\n\n2. [AMC in the summer before the run to $70](https://i.imgur.com/zIIjuPd.png)\n\n3. [MU in the fall](https://i.imgur.com/niAiF8S.png) \n\n- [GME now](https://i.imgur.com/ewPa5P0.png)\n\nI do not believe the current lull in GME IV and other meme stocks will last forever. As you can see in the GME chart, whenever GME reaches a trough of low IV rank, it does not take long for the IV to increase and the price to spike. \n\nNow low IV percentile does not guarantee a stock will explode to the upside. What the previous 3 examples had along with low IV was high open interest in the options chain. Institutions were accumulating options on those stocks during that time period. Currently, OG meme stock (GME, AMC, NOK, BB) option chains are brimming with open interest. Wyckoff and Pelosi lets me believe the volatility will be to the upside.  \n\n*"Buy AMC, it will beat GME!!"*  \nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH\n\nIf you actually got this far (wtf?), thank you for letting me waste your time. You must really be taking a fat shit on the toilet. I\'m still not done talking though, so don\'t wipe yet. \n\n##Last week, we all saw what the greatest trader in America\'s free market has purchased. \nFrom her holdings, Nancy Pelosi is bullish on 3 sectors:  \n- tech/cloud =&gt; MU, GOOGL, CRM  \n- metaverse =&gt; RBLX  \n- reopening =&gt; DIS, REOF XX LLC (owns Marriott hotels)\n\nIf Pelosi is bullish on these 3 sectors, then there is no way they wouldn\'t be tendie machines in 2022 right? It just so happens GME fits as a metaverse and reopening play. It isn\'t a metaverse play yet though. GME plans for the metaverse are unknown outside of speculation, [but they do have something in motion](https://www.yahoo.com/now/gamestop-eyes-metaverse-hunt-ethereum-174139128.html). This could be a strong catalyst. &gt;!Hey look the 💍 chart is bull flagging while GME is consolidating. Could it be tha- oh fuck I\'m out of tinfoil to wrap around my head.!&lt; \n\nClearly, Nancy Pelosi thinks Omnicron is bullish. I am no doctor/scientist, but if she is willing to bet on Disney and Marriott hotels doing well this year then the heavily shorted retail stores may see upside as well. Good thing GME is a part of those too (XRT). A rising tide raises all ships.  \n\n*"But but no business plan, they are burning cash, the fundament-"*   \nShut the fuck up. When was the last time fundamentals mattered? TSLA sure is worth $1000+ a share. RIVN is defintely worth $100+. Fundamentals will catch up eventually, but in the meantime this market moves on supply and demand. So fuck the news, we\'ll only crash if JPOW runs out of ink or yank rates back to the Volcker days. \n\nGME may not have the same reported short interest and retail interest as it did last year, but it has lower liquidity thanks to a cult locking up shares and better fundamental catalysts.\n\nNow with gradually decreasing supply, if the overall retail interest were to return and bring back demand, GME could... Nevermind, you didn\'t hear it from me.   \n\n*"A price run in GME would ignite the MOASS. Shorts never covered!!!"*  \n[TOdAy\'S ThE dAy !7!4!1!](https://i.imgur.com/qmoxd6r.png)  \nBut hey you guys might be right and I fucking hope so.

To me, Elon has proven himself enough times to take notice of what he’s saying. Here is the link for anyone who hasn’t seen it:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM23sjhtk4Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM23sjhtk4Q)\n\nElon’s the GOAT. The man operates on a different level. However, when I watch that video, to me, his argument sounds like “Businessman” Elon rather than “Engineer” Elon. This video gives me the feeling of a defense of Tesla’s strategy to rely on cameras and vision more so than a reasonable knock on lidar tech in general. Maybe I’m wrong but that’s how it sounds to me. \n\nThe other thing to consider here is LAZR is not trying to create a fully autonomous vehicle with their lidar alone. Their goal is simply to **decrease** the amount of accidents on the roads each year. With lidar, objects and hazards can be detected further in advance than what the human eye can see, and using it, decisions can be made either by the driver or the car to account for the data. Rather than trying to copy Tesla’s goal of creating a fully autonomous car, LAZR is simply trying to bridge the gap in safety for semi-autonomy (right now). \n\nThat’s HUGE in considering LAZR as an investment. IMO, we are still a decade or two away from human drivers being taken out of the equation completely. This is an opportunity that I believe LAZR is in the best position to take advantage of.\n\nNow to bring up their partnerships, which are numerous (over 50 total, with 8 out of 10 top automakers). The biggest and most well-known one is with Volvo. LAZR was chosen to be **STANDARDIZED** in Volvo’s 2022 XC 90 series. Notice the capitalized and bolded word there - **STANDARDIZED**. Meaning it’s not an option. Godamn, Volvo. That’s big. That’s an investment in the future. In safety. In trusting a 20-something whiz kid with an $83 millski house. They’ve even found a way to incorporate the hardware in a sexy way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Nice.](https://preview.redd.it/w6na56664b981.jpg?width=309&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9896a8d4edd2c81d62923a44b936e3206be6b6)\n\nAs you can see, that’s a sleek design. Far better than what we all imagine when we think of lidar and all the shit attached to the roof of the car. I like that looks of it. \n\nAt this point, you might be saying to yourself, “This guy provided literally no pertinent or useful information in this post. No hard numbers, projections, nothing. It’s all speculation. Why the fuck should I listen to WSB’s worst investor?” (See my previous loss porn posts)\n\nValid. It’s a fair point. Why didn’t I include some DCF model numbers, growth projections, TAM, etc? I’ll tell you why. Cause it’s fucking hard. And time consuming. It requires more brain power than I currently have. I’m more of an intuition guy anyways. It also seems like something a hedge fund would do to garner support from rich/seasoned, non-retarded investors. I’m not looking for rich/seasoned, non-retarded investors. I’m looking for apes. You shouldn’t listen to me with your head. Listen to me with your heart. And balls. If you’re gonna trust some asshole on the internet with the worst trading track record of all time, do it because it feels right. \n\nDoes it feel right?\n\nPS: it may be wise to short this company given my bullish position. If you shorted all the companies I was bullish on the past two years, you’d be in great shape.\n\nWith that said, 2022 is the year of the LAZR. It’s mooning…….. Maybe.\n\nPPS: there could very well be some wrong information in here. I'm not perfect.

I just consulted my green crayons, and I must report my findings. First, they were delicious. Second, I have a disproportionately asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for you smooth brains, and I kept this post brief (relative to my previous post), so focus. If you squander this opportunity, you deserve it.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n1. Five months ago, shorts filed a report with the FDA alleging SAVA manipulated its data leading to a bear raid. The report demanded halting drug trials to protect patients but forgot to mention a single safety issue (in over 70 pages). LMAO. You can not make this up. The SP fell over 66% in the aftermath because we all know how theatrical Mr. Market is. The FDA must respond to the allegations within 150 days from the date of the accusations (January 19th, 2022). The false assertions cratered the SP, so the question is: what will happen when the FDA, the principal governing authority of late-stage clinical trials, dismisses irrelevant preclinical claims backed by kindergarten logic? I anticipate SP recovery. **In this post, I will explain why the FDA will dismiss the allegations and SAVA will recover its losses (432% gains).**\n2. **Then I summarize how SAVAge Cassava Sciences Investor base is. We, patients at risk for AD, families of AD patients, Scientists, and Physicians have rallied around historical bulletproof, \\*clinical\\* data.**\n3. **No Sincere scientist will EVER advocate for stopping research on a safe and promising medication as the shorts are.**\n\n**First** **Math Class:**\n\nSP’s ATH was $147. It fell to 34 = 66% after allegations\n\nThirty-four back to 147 is an increase of 432%.\n\n**Complete recovery means the SP will Increase 432%, not 66%.**\n\n**A Quick Recap Of The Data And Wild Stock Runup:**\n\nFor this discussion, understand SAVA has had two trials. A 28-day trial (completed) and an ongoing OLE/CMS trial ( both in Phase 2). As these trials progressed and respective data released, the stock went parabolic, why? **In its entirety, data this robust, to this degree, duration, and consistency has never been seen in the Alzheimer’s space**. In summary, A full panel of 17 biomarkers showed a positive response to Simufilam (SAVA’s drug) in the 28-day trial. Then the OLE/CMS trial released Cognitive data at 6, 9, and 12 months, dazzling SAVAges with each release. In this time, the SP went from under $5 to over $140 (Market cap of 5 billion+). As a physician and patient advocate, I might be excited about the data, but Mr. Market makes me look relatively dull.\n\nWhy did the market value the data at 5 billion? [Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), A senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, said it best:\n\n***"If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer\'s disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history."***\n\nPut simply, this is precisely what Simufilam accomplished. Definitive cognitive improvement with a small molecule pill. I can not overstate the data’s significance, as Alzheimer\'s currently has no effective treatment and is the 6th leading cause of death. Based on the TAM, probability of FDA approval, and similar metrics, the SP was expected to appreciate more than $1000 by the approval date (valuation model below for wrinkle-brained investors). Great, right? Well, that’s when all the drama started, and it\'s been one hell of a rollercoaster since.\n\nBut before we move on, for effect, Here is SImufilam’s data compared to placebo and Donanemab (competition). Aduhelm’s (another competitor) data thus far is worse than Donanemab’s results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7uirkrw9o981.png?width=518&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4b8e011e0296a3b92874df2a9f7b2fc50e853a7\n\n**Short Allegation Destroy Shareholder Value:**\n\nOn August 2021, a coordinated short raid asked the FDA to halt further testing to protect patients (pretending to be “whistleblowers” and hiding their short bet). The bogus claims asked the FDA to stop further research in the interest of patient safety (the blatant disregard for patients is remarkable as there were NO safety issues, and halting research literally harms patients). Still, the stock collapsed. You might assume the price action signified the |accusations| (err slander) had merit or a chance of succeeding. You would be wholly incorrect. Unfortunately, libel has a real and immediate impact, substantiated or not. Institutions and many investors positively won’t Hodl an already risky/binary biotech play. Pragmatic but unfortunate because, again, the shorts could not point to a single safety issue related to the drug after more than 147,000 dosing events in human trials. Wait, wait, let me get this correct. Let us illuminate this concept one step at a time:\n\n1. The FDA is the ONLY governing authority for human/clinical trials that will Halt trials.\n2. The FDA will only halt phase 3 trials to ensure patient safety.\n3. The shorts say they want the FDA to halt Phase 3 because of safety issues.\n4. But the shorts cannot point to a single safety issue after 147,000+ doses???\n\nI am not being facetious. This is not hyperbole. It is exactly what the shorts are saying. LMAO. Every time I review this, Im verbatim am at a loss for words. Worse, I can’t believe Mr. Market overreacted on this ‘news.’ The bottom line is there is NO way the FDA will halt phase 3 trials. I can not illustrate it any clearer for you smooth brains, but for emphasis, please repeat after me; the medication is safe, so trials will continue, **and continue they did**. **The FDA allowed not one but two separate phase 3 trials to begin, and the OLE and CMS Phase 2 trials continue (after reviewing the allegations).** Since the allegations were made, the continuation and initiation across four separate SAVA trials SHOULD be enough evidence the allegations will be dismissed; however, Mr. Market can\'t stop sniffing crayons. Please give Mr. Market some time. When he realizes he was wrong, he will look like a deer in headlights and drop his crayons as the SP recovers by or before January 19, 2022, IMO. **More importantly, this is your buying opportunity**. If I have to tell you that I don’t have a crystal ball and can not predict the future, you should stop reading. My opinions are based on the above and below evidence. Do your own DD; I could be wrong (but im probably not ;)).\n\n**Need More Evidence?**\n\nRing lead of the shorts himself essentially admitting the allegations (CP) will be dismissed. Adrian posted this two days ago because he knows the CP will be rejected. LMAO. Sorry, these shorts are getting pathetic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yc70rqxy9o981.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6e73d5f6c9994ce23480f7d569236c755bf9f45\n\nYou will find exactly ZERO cases of medications with promising clinical data, halted by anyone, FDA/SEC/NIH/IRB when there is no safety issue. (let\'s throw the DOJ and the FBI in there because that\'s what the shorts are trying). Yes, they are trying this. Don\'t believe me? Read their tweets. A safety assessment was the whole point of conducting phase 2 trials, and phase 2 confirmed Simufilam is safe. The FDA would not allow SAVA to start Phase 3 (as the FDA did already) if they were worried about safety. A nuanced point for those who thoroughly reviewed the data: Under NO circumstance is it acceptable to halt phase 3. To say we need more data is valid, but to say stop testing the medication is beyond disingenuous and screams an ulterior motive. **No sincere scientist will EVER try to stop research on a safe medication, much less a safe drug with promising data.** If I have ever seen desperation, this has to be it.\n\n**Still More Evidence:**\n\nOn November 4th, The Journal of Neuroscience (A third-party) responded to the allegations against $SAVA. **They stated, "there are no signs of data manipulation." SAVA SP increased 100% in 3 days.** I anticipate a similar market reaction when a more significant governing authority (the FDA) dismisses the false allegations.\n\n**Remi The Dimond Handed Heathen Barbarian (AKA Cheif SAVAge):**\n\nSAVA Insiders have been BUYING. Remi (the CEO) has accumulated over a million shares. It’s difficult to overstate how bullish it is for a biotech CEO to go full silverback with his own coin on the open market buying up his own stock and then diamond handing it through trials (when he sees unreleased/ongoing data and knows more than any of us). Sanford (another board member) accumulated over 900,000 shares starting 9/17/20. Both have massive gains on their positions currently, but they still have not [sol](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sava/insider-activity)d.\n\n[Compare](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRTX/insider-trades/) SAVA insider buying to another Alz drug in trials like Cortexyme Inc .

Okay, the data readout was “primary endpoints were not met” meaning the study failed. Insiders were selling big time and for a big reason.\n\nNow let’s look at SAVA:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjv8j3y3ao981.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=116f1e277fa4fe6b96ec27f748a03609057045ae\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/)\n\nSAVA is sitting on tons of unreleased Phase 2 data (visible to its board), and the final Phase 3 trials are ongoing. The insider trading activity speaks for itself. **As Peter Lynch said, “Insiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one reason.”**\n\nTo reiterate, the insiders have only accumulated and held for over two years. The smooth brain market won’t stop its bedwetting until the FDA ultimately dismisses the allegation. That date will be on/or before January 19th, 2022.\n\n**But Im, an intermediate-term swing trader with erectile dysfunction. What do you have for me, Professor?**\n\nThere will be another tremendous catalyst for those interested in an intermediate-term opportunity. SAVA collaborated with CUNY School of Medicine to develop this revolutionary drug, Simufilam. When the Shorts attacked the consulting scientist and his work, Remi, the CEO, asked CUNY to investigate the matter to ensure the integrity and offer transparency (because that\'s what the guilty do, right? right.) A review of CUNY\'s protocol shows that CUNY will announce its conclusion on or before 210 days (march-ish).\n\nSAVA is also expecting to release biomarker data soon. Historically, SAVA has released interim data-keeping investors up to date. As discussed above, SAVA is sitting on a lot of data to be released.\n\nOther potential drivers of price action include:\n\n* A SI of 40%. (ATH’s)\n* A float of less than 40 million.\n* A cult-like investor base will never sell unless the data changes (The next TSLA, anyone?)\n\nAll this information is for short-term/ intermediate-term traders. Long or short, expect massive price swings over the next several months.\n\n**I have more wrinkles than these degenerate smooth brains and rock-solid erections, so what do you have, Professor?**\n\n[The DATA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam)\n\nWhy did I invest in this nauseating rollercoaster ride? Because of the cognition data. The shorts will shift the narrative to preclinical science, but the cognition data eclipses all. The clinical data are the results we see in walking talking patients. Briefly, if a medication kills humans (clinical data), it does not matter what your western bloat says (pre-clinical data). Simufilams CLINICAL data is all that matters at this stage of testing, and simply put, it is EPIC. Read about why the shorts shift the narrative here: “[Why the Critics are Tuning Out the Cognition Data](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-why-the-critics-are-tuning-out-the-cognition-data).”\n\n**Simufilam\'s data shows it is:**\n\n**1).

These sites also perform trials for AD drugs by Biogen and Eli Lilly. Additionally, the chain of custody was made transparent and verified by two independent biostatisticians. The FDA maintains a master file with all the raw data (including excluded patients and why they were excluded). CRA’s, third parties to both Cassava Sciences and the clinical sites, monitor the ADAS scores, review the raw data and adjust scores to ensure consistency and integrity. SAVA uses electronic data capture, which permanently records the data submitted by the independent clinical sites, and the software logs all addendums with time stamps. With that out of the way…\n\nLong-term investors can expect valuation metrics to drive the SP over 750 within two years. I didn\'t accidentally add too many zeros.

Similarly, the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit (SAVA data is vastly superior).***\n\nSAVA\'s market cap sits at less than two billion dollars currently (get in while you can). The last point, as I invested in the data, the expected data updates are integral to my investment thesis. I’ll be awaiting those, and changes in the data will change my investment.\n\n**House cleaning:**\n\nI spared the details of the drama surrounding this stock, but to update those that follow me: Our discord group has swelled from the initial 12 SAVAges to over 1700 members over the last three months, and it\'s multiplying.

Join our discord and come to see his gains and recommendations for yourself. I, myself, have gained over 1900% (19x) over two years (yes even after the market crapped out in 2021). The first thing you will notice about successful investors is the amount of data we examine closely to see what others miss.

Both MD/Ph.Ds from Johns Hopkins (Geoffry Pitt and David Bredt). Pitt currently teaches future cardiologists at Cornell. This incredible resume belongs to men who thought it brilliant to use allegations against a childhood rape survivor. TBredt and Pitt say she lied about her rape. WTF does that have to do with halting trials, you say (as does anyone with ordinary common sense)? They answer: because. Is that the safety issue I missed??. Is this for real, or what am I missing? Gezus!

Flashing your credentials will not help you. Shifting the narrative will not work. **The clinical data is historical and bulletproof, and I will not let this fact get lost; you\'ve been warned.** There is no point in arguing. If you genuinely believe SAVA is a fraud, and the FDA will halt trials on or before January 19th or ever, then place your (ill-informed losing) bets. What shorts and longs agree on is that SAVA does not know how to go sideways. It will either, enter orbit Pluto or plummet to $7 (cash price).\n\nAnyone with genuine questions or believes my trusted experts and I missed something, I look forward to a civil discussion.\n\nWSB seems to always delete my posts without a clear explanation why, so preemptively here is a google doc, and IF the post gets deleted, I\'ll repost in the SAVA subreddit.\n\nAll the above represent my own opinions.

This sector is still new all the companies listed below have been transitioning from traditional manufacturing to digital manufacturing, this is why you will see so much volatility. The industry 4.0 manufacturing companies are trying to figure out where to price itself, this could be as high as $280 or as low as $50. The specialized sector of digital manufacturing is very small my best guess in research is roughly 30 publicly traded tickers. As these companies fully transition into digital prototyping and manufacturing they will start to take away profits from the companies they manufacture for. This is the gap Fathom wants to fill first, low to mid volume production. As their market share grows here stock prices should follow. None of these companies own more than 3% of the digital manufacturing segment, and Fathom wants to acquire them all. The biggest take away from the chart below is the floor, all of these companies trade at $20+.

Well throughout these dips this week the stock always managed to recover and close above the 5 day EMA and the 20 day EMA... until today. \n\nThis closed the candle below the 20 day EMA of 470.4... historically looking back whenever SPY closed a candle below the 20 day it usually bounces near the 100 day EMA which is 455.2\n\nThe same applies to the daily bollinger bands.

I just consulted my green crayons, and I must report my findings. First, they were delicious. Second, I have a disproportionately asymmetric risk-reward opportunity for you smooth brains, and I kept this post brief (relative to my previous post), so focus. Let’s not squander this opportunity.\n\n**TLDR:** \n\n1. Five months ago, shorts filed a report with the FDA alleging SAVA manipulated its data leading to a drop in the price. The report demanded halting drug trials to protect patients but forgot to mention a single safety issue (in over 70 pages). LMAO. You can not make this up. The price fell over 66% in the aftermath because we all know how theatrical Mr. Market is. The FDA must respond to the allegations within 150-180 days from the date of the accusations depending on the manner of filing. Because the false assertions cratered the stock price, I believe when the FDA, the principal governing authority of late-stage clinical trials, dismisses irrelevant preclinical claims backed by kindergarten logic, then I anticipate price recovery. **In this post, I will explain why the FDA will dismiss the allegations and SAVA will recover its losses (432% gains).**\n2. **Then I summarize how SAVAge Cassava Sciences Investor base is. We, patients at risk for AD, families of AD patients, Scientists, and Physicians have rallied around historical bulletproof, \\*clinical\\* data.**\n3. &amp;#x200B;\n\n**Math Class:**\n\nStock price’s ATH was $147. It fell to 34 = 77% after allegations\n\nThirty-four back to 147 is an increase of 432%.\n\n**Complete recovery means the price will Increase 432%, not 66%.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A quick recap of the data and stock runup:**\n\nFor this discussion, understand SAVA has had two trials. A 28-day trial (completed) and an ongoing OLE/CMS trial (both in Phase 2). As these trials progressed and respective data released, the stock went parabolic, why? **In its entirety, data this robust, to this degree, duration, and consistency has never been seen in the Alzheimer’s space**. In summary, A full panel of 17 biomarkers showed a positive response to Simufilam (SAVA’s drug) in the 28-day trial. Then the OLE/CMS trial released Cognitive data at 6, 9, and 12 months, dazzling SAVAges with each release. In this time, the price went from under $5 to over $140 (Market cap of 5 billion+). As a physician and patient advocate, I might be excited about the data, but Mr. Market makes me look relatively dull. \n\nWhy did the market value the data at 5 billion? [ Michael Engelsgjerd](https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2021/11/19/cassava-science-drug-trials-sec-investigation.htm), A senior equity research analyst at Bloomberg who specializes in the biotech sector, said it best: \n\n***"If you can develop a small molecule pill for Alzheimer\'s disease that can definitively improve cognition, that would very likely become the most successful product in pharmaceutical history."*** \n\nPut simply, this is precisely what Simufilam accomplished. Definitive cognitive improvement with a small molecule pill. I can not overstate the data’s significance, as Alzheimer\'s currently has no effective treatment and is the 6th leading cause of death. Based on the TAM, probability of FDA approval, and similar metrics, the price was expected to appreciate more than $1000 by the approval date (valuation model below for wrinkle-brained investors). Great, right? Well, that’s when all the drama started, and it\'s been one hell of a rollercoaster since.  \n\nBut before we move on, for effect, Here is SImufilam’s data compared to placebo and Donanemab (competition). Aduhelm’s (another competitor) data thus far, is worse than Donanemab’s results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mui1zs60z981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02dc23fb4794b0d2b41878ffeb3ff7f01f21f4be\n\n**Short Allegation Destroy Shareholder Value:** \n\nOn August 2021, a short report was filed with the FDA (called a citizen’s petition) to halt further testing to protect patients. The claims, by Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt (more on them later), asked the FDA to stop further research in the interest of patient safety; however, the report 70-page report and five supplements mentioned no significant adverse events. Here is the full [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) for your viewing pleasure. You might assume the price action signified the|accusations had merit or a chance of succeeding. You would be wholly incorrect. Unfortunately, libel has a real and immediate impact, substantiated or not. Institutions and many investors positively won’t Hodl an already risky/binary biotech play. Pragmatic but unfortunate because, again, the shorts could not point to a single safety issue related to the drug after more than 147,000 dosing events in human trials (Facts). Wait, wait, let me get this correct. Let us illuminate this concept one step at a time:\n\n1) The FDA is the ONLY governing authority for human/clinical trials that will halt trials. \n\n2) The FDA will only halt phase 3 trials to ensure patient safety. \n\n3) Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt say they want the FDA to halt Phase 3 because of safety issues. \n\n4) But Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt cannot point to a single safety issue after 147,000+ doses? The summary of the number of doses can be found [here](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam), and again here is the [report](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FDA-2021-P-0930/document) filed by Pitt and Bredit.\n\n5) Thus IMO, there is NO chance of the FDA halting trials.\n\nI am not being facetious. This is not hyperbole. It is exactly what Dr. Bredt and Dr. Pitt are saying. LMAO. Every time I review this, Im verbatim am at a loss for words. Worse, I can’t believe Mr. Market overreacted on this ‘news.’ The bottom line is there is NO way the FDA will halt phase 3 trials. I can not illustrate it any clearer for you smooth brains, but for emphasis, please repeat after me; the medication is safe, so trials will continue, **and continue they did**. **The FDA allowed not one but two separate phase 3 trials to begin, and the OLE and CMS Phase 2 trials continue (after reviewing the allegations).** Since the allegations were made, the continuation and initiation across four separate SAVA trials SHOULD be enough evidence the allegations will be dismissed; however, Mr. Market can\'t stop sniffing crayons. Please give Mr. Market some time. When he realizes he was wrong, he will look like a deer in headlights and drop his crayons as the price recovers leading up to the citizen’s petition dismissal. IMO. **More importantly, this is your buying opportunity**. If I have to tell you that I don’t have a crystal ball and can not predict the future, you should stop reading. My opinions are based on the above and below evidence.  Do your own DD; I could be wrong (but I’m probably not ;)).\n\n**Need More Evidence?**\n\nBelow is a tweet essentially admitting the allegations (CP) will be dismissed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a84qpth90z981.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1f1c56cd14553c388e56edd2567abcb10785a9d\n\nYou will find exactly ZERO cases of medications with promising clinical data, halted by anyone, FDA/SEC/NIH/IRB when there is no safety issue (let\'s throw the DOJ and the FBI in there because that\'s what the Adrain et al. are trying). A safety assessment was the entire point of conducting phase 2 trials, and phase 2 confirmed Simufilam is safe. The FDA would not allow SAVA to start Phase 3 (as the FDA did already) if they were worried about safety. A nuanced point for those who thoroughly reviewed the data: Under no circumstance is it acceptable to halt phase 3.\n\n**Still More Evidence:**\n\nOn November 4th, The Journal of Neuroscience (A third-party) responded to the allegations against $SAVA. **They stated, "there are no signs of data manipulation." SAVA price increased 100% in 3 days.** I anticipate a similar market reaction when a more significant governing authority (the FDA) dismisses the false allegations. \n\n**Remi The Diamond Handed Heathen Barbarian (AKA Chief SAVAge):**\n\nSAVA Insiders have been BUYING. Remi (the CEO) has accumulated over a million shares. It’s difficult to overstate how bullish it is for a biotech CEO to go full silverback with his own coin on the open market buying up his own stock and then diamond handing it through trials (when he sees unreleased/ongoing data and knows more than any of us). Sanford (another board member) accumulated over 900,000 shares starting 9/17/20. Both have massive gains on their positions currently, but they still have not [sol](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/sava/insider-activity)d.\n\n[Compare](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/CRTX/insider-trades/) SAVA insider buying to another Alz drug in trials like Cosyntex. Here is their insider trading. Take a look, and then guess whether the trial data that dropped in Q4 ended up good or bad:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eu4s6wkg0z981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=196ed053083cae9e70a8e9bd583f78b84c9a24cf\n\nReady?  Okay, the data readout was “primary endpoints were not met” meaning the study failed. Insiders were selling big time and for a big reason. \n\nNow let’s look at SAVA:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yxisqrui0z981.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2ee063b74d1266c778ff3760281d3f574e266cf\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SAVA/insider-trades/)\n\nSAVA is sitting on tons of unreleased Phase 2 data (visible to its board), and the final Phase 3 trials are ongoing. The insider trading activity speaks for itself.  **As Peter Lynch said, “Insiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one reason.”** \n\nTo reiterate, the insiders have only accumulated and held for over two years. The smooth brain market won’t stop its bedwetting until the FDA ultimately dismisses the allegation. IMO, that date will be on/or before February 21st, 2022. In some instances, the FDA may respond by the deadline and say they are extending, but as long as the FDA does not halt trials SAVA is on its way to FDA approval. As discussed above, IMO, the sky will fall before the FDA halts trials.\n\n**But Im, an intermediate-term swing trader with erectile dysfunction. What do you have for me, Professor?**\n\nThere will be another tremendous catalyst for those interested in an intermediate-term opportunity. SAVA collaborated with CUNY School of Medicine to develop this revolutionary drug, Simufilam. When the Shorts attacked the consulting scientist and his work, Remi, the CEO, asked CUNY to investigate the matter to ensure the integrity and offer transparency (because that\'s what the guilty do, right? right.) A review of CUNY\'s protocol shows that CUNY will announce its conclusion on or before 210 days (March-ish). \n\nSAVA is also expecting to release biomarker data soon. Historically, SAVA has released interim data-keeping investors up to date. As discussed above, SAVA is sitting on a lot of data to be released.  \n\nOther potential drivers of price action include:\n\n* A SI of 40%. (ATH’s)\n* A float of less than 40 million.\n* A dedicated investor base will never sell unless the data changes (The next TSLA, anyone?)\n\nAll this information is for short-term/ intermediate-term traders. Long or short, expect massive price swings over the next several months.  \n\n**I have more wrinkles than these degenerate smooth brains and rock-solid erections, so what do you have, Professor?**\n\n[The DATA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/citizen-s-petition-to-fda-for-expedited-approval-of-simufilam)\n\nWhy did I invest in this nauseating rollercoaster ride? Because of the cognition data. Dr. Pitt and Dr. Bredt will shift the narrative to preclinical science, but the cognition data eclipses all. The clinical data are the results we see in walking talking patients. Briefly, if a medication kills humans (clinical data), it does not matter what your western blot says (pre-clinical data). **The FDA will never ignore dying humans for western blots. The opposite is also true.** Simufilam’s CLINICAL data shows cognitive and behavioral improvement.  This is all that matters at this stage of testing, and simply put, it is EPIC. Read about why critics shift the narrative here: “[Why the Critics are Tuning Out the Cognition Data](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-why-the-critics-are-tuning-out-the-cognition-data).”\n\n**Simufilam\'s data shows it is:** \n\n**1). Safe**\n\n**2) Effective** \n\n**3) Desperately needed by Alzheimers patients.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Before shorts attack the integrity of the Cognition data:**\n\nIt was collected over sixteen clinical sites, across the US and Canada, by physician principal investigators and their associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). These sites also perform trials for AD drugs by Biogen and Eli Lilly. These clinical sites can be audited by the IRB at any time. Additionally, the chain of custody was made transparent and verified by two independent biostatisticians. The sponsor (SAVA) maintains a master file with all the raw data (including excluded patients and why they were excluded) which can be audited by the FDA at any time. CRA’s, third parties to both Cassava Sciences and the clinical sites, monitor the ADAS scores, review the raw data and adjust scores to ensure consistency and integrity. SAVA uses electronic data capture, which permanently records the data submitted by the independent clinical sites, and the software logs all addendums with time stamps. With that out of the way…\n\nLong-term investors can expect valuation metrics to drive the price over 750-1000 within two years. Here is a full breakdown of TAM and why [SAVA](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/opinion-sava-may-be-a-once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity.) is so valuable. A common psychological phenomenon is a disbelief resulting in rejection of simple math. It’s simple math, so look it over with an open mind.\n\nI must always share my favorite summary of how much the market values Alzheimer\'s treatment.  \n\n***On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer\'s medication, and the market cap increased by $17 billion in one day. Similarly, the day $LLY and $RHBBY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) of their AD medication, their market cap increased by $15 billion and $13 billion, respectively (on the same day). All three of these medications demonstrated little to no cognitive benefit (SAVA data is vastly superior).*** \n\nSAVA\'s market cap sits at less than two billion dollars currently (get in while you can). The last point is, I invested in the data, the expected data updates are integral to my investment thesis. I’ll be awaiting those, and changes in the data will change my investment.\n\n**House cleaning:**\n\nI spared the details of the drama surrounding this stock, but to update those that follow me: our group of Scientist investors together we have written a 48-page research report on SAVA [here, "A Comprehensive Stock Analysis"](https://www.sava-ad.com/post/cassava-sciences-sava-comprehensive-stock-analysis). \n\nThe Authors include\n\nClinical and Academic Neurologists, \n\nMDs, \n\nPhDs, \n\nPharmDs, \n\nSuccessful biotech investors \n\nAn Chief Global Strategist and Healthcare Leader\n\nThrough my investing career, IMO, the first thing you will notice about successful investors is the amount of data they examine closely to see what others miss. Mr. Market\'s "headline hysteria" usually means buying opportunities for them (“overreaction with reversion to the mean”).\n\nSAVA\'s YT presence had grown courtesy of the one and only OG Joe Springer (He was a bull when SAVA was $6).  \n\nIf you have dyslexia and prefer to watch (not read), please watch [ Dr. Boyers (Academic and Clinical Neurologist) discuss SAVA\'s medication with Joe Springer here](https://youtu.be/h55Rio8qhy8).\n\n**Did I mention SAVA’s historical data and Alzheimer’s patients, families, physicians, and scientists have become a dedicated investor base rallying around the historical data? We are investors that will not sell unless the data changes.** \n\nWith the allegations expiring and the CUNY investigation ending, our SAVAge group plans to start pitching to tutes.  \n\n**Lastly:**\n\n**The clinical data is historical and bulletproof, and I will not let this fact get lost.** There is no point in arguing. If you genuinely believe SAVA is a fraud and the FDA will halt trials, then place your (ill-informed losing) bets. What shorts and longs agree on is that SAVA does not know how to go sideways. It will either orbit Pluto or implode to $7 (cash price).  \n\nAnyone with genuine questions or who believes my trusted experts and I missed something, I look forward to a civil discussion.  \n\nAll the above represent my own opinions.

We also have a confirmed daily and weekly sell on the MACD along with a bearish engulfing weekly candle. \n\nnext week i expect a similar fate for us. i expect us to retest the support at the 50 ema which i suspect we will break easily at 464.5. from there we should continue this stair step down towards the final goal/ support at the 100 ema near 455. i suspect it to be closer to 456-457 by time we get there. i do find it rather healthy the way this sell off is happening. instead of wild -2%+ days we are slowly stair stepping down. i like it. \n\none thing im watching here is that in general gaps are filled. however if this stair stepping is continued the gap will be below both the 100 ema and the support line. we could see a fast wic down to fill it and a hard bounce. but if that red dotted support line thats over 1.5 years old is broken. we very well could see an even more significant 10%+ from ATH dip. im not convinced thats the market sentiment though yet and will evaluate once there. \n\nim playing my puts till we break below 460 then i will be looking to sell them and find some longer dated calls. i of course still play the intraday options but for my long term thats my play. \n\nof course added a picture of my positons to show im not full of it. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WYKp46C.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GZgW2Vw.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sHCaYGG.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/jhWHtaD.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BiH7thh.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/piOf3iG.jpeg'), ('$TSLA is wayyyy oversold!', '$TSLA is wayyyy oversold!'), ('PUTS Wrap up: AFRM, AMD, GME, BA', 'PUTS Wrap up: AFRM, AMD, GME, BA'), ('Spy puts and spy puts only', 'Spy puts and spy puts only[removed]'), ('How many of you retards think SPY will hit 480 again before the end of the January?

A wider perspective.', 'Is it different this time? A wider perspective.While most of us believe stock market is extremely overvalued with many mini bubbles popping up everywhere, I just wanted to look at this a bit differently by introducing a historical perspective in terms of the companies that make up today\'s markets, technology, the wealth creation and generation and most importantly the flow of money into goods and services.\n\nI wasn\'t old enough to grasp the dot-com crash back in early 2000\'s and while I do remember \'08 crash pretty well, it took me many years to understand the underlying drivers of it. Over the years I tried to expand my knowledge of the markets and always tried to look at things from an historical perspective especially at those periods when markets were down/flat/didn\'t go anywhere for years or decades. With that perspective, what I want to try here is to use the benefit of hindsight, but not to state the obvious, but rather, state how things turned out in reality vs expectations at the time.\n\nListening to Warren Buffett\'s older speeches, one of the things he mentions often was that how American society thought they would be taken over by Japan in terms of technological advancement back in the late 70\'s and early 80\'s and that there was not enough optimism with respect to American innovation that could prevail its leadership going into the following decades. While obviously not the only factor, this lack of optimism was apparently evident in markets and there were many years not much was happening.\n\nIt is actually fascinating to observe that over the coming years, the exact opposite has happened. Introduction of computer in the 60\'s in the west coast, perhaps much earlier than most of the world, the creation of Silicon Valley and emergence in big-tech are more than just happenstance. I am not an American. While i will not go too further deep into this topic here, my personal view is this all goes back to foundations of the country and the fact that there is no cultural baggage/deeply embedded subconscious that prevents things from happening on this side world. Perhaps the big reason for this is the change in behavior/consciousness of people who emigrated here and were able to drop the burdens of the past.\n\nIf you think about the wealth currently possessed in our world, most of it was perhaps created/generated in the last 50-100 years (perhaps even 20-30 years). You might have been born somewhere with rich history (as I was), your forefathers and the empires that they have built could have ruled the world for hundreds or thousands of years and conquered every corner of the world, but none of that matters now. It\'s as if millions of years of history is almost irrelevant at this point because you were either able to adapt things in the past few decades or you were not. What I am obviously talking about here is the new creation of wealth as the existing wealth matters less and less each day. One of the reasons for this is obviously the fact that the world has not seen a "reset" since World War 2. It is perhaps the first time in history when we had such prolonged peace.\n\nLet\'s thing for a second the implications of globalization in this peace period. This is perhaps the first time in history where the world is so connected that even the products we use on a daily basis are the same. Imagine the flow of goods and services 50 years ago or even 25 years ago. Were you able to access goods and services overseas this easily? Where would your disposable income be spent on? Even 25 years ago local markets did matter for the most part. I\'d watch local TV, buy local newspaper, only a handful people had cellphones, internet was still nascent, most of the appliances in your home were already a commodity. If you had disposable income, most of the money would be circulated within the local economy and the most expensive things would be the house you\'d buy (that obviously does not change today) and a car which would benefit a few countries but not a single country (perhaps Germany for the most part). So all in all, there was no single country that the money was flowing into. This is was not possible by design.\n\nI am not saying all this goes away now. But thinking for a second, isn\'t this really the first time that a significant portion of disposable income, wherever you are in the world, flows into one single country? And for economies in which this does not happen, do they really matter to the global wealth in grand scheme of things?\n\nEurope or Middle East for instance, amazing blend of many cultures, languages. The entire world once was ruled from Mesopotamia, then Ancient Egypt/Ancient Greece, then Rome and so on. Are they relevant anymore? What does a beloved country of Italy contribute to world economy these days? France? Spain? UK? South East Asia? - amazing corners of the world, billions of amazing people. Do they matter from a wealth creation and money of flow perspective? Of course they do, but to what extent if you think about \'end products\' - goods and services. What they do produce that the entire world consumes/needs. Of course Middle East has oil. But oil is a raw material and the goods and services used by this wealth creation does not necessarily change - the cars they buy, the planes they fly, the services they use are not locally produced. Take Saudi Arabia, a total GDP about $800 billion with all the oil. Apple generated $366 billion revenues in the last twelve months (obviously not the best analogy).\n\nLet\'s expand upon this.\n\nLet\'s assume you wake up in the corner of the world and don\'t have survival problem. What you do or spend your time is not significantly different than us here in the US. Your homepage is google for everything, you use whatsapp to talk to your friends, you are on instagram, your business uses outlook/microsoft, your phone is samsung/apple/android, you log into youtube on a daily basis, you prefer to watch netflix over local TV. (Sure, China is different from this aspect but it is also the reason why they have been outpacing everywhere else in terms of economic growth. They were not stupid about this and realized the effects of globalization early on).\n\nNow, you might be thinking - dude that is only such a small portion of the world. Millions of people don\'t even have access to any of those. I am well aware of that and while it is correct for the most part, from an "overall wealth creation perspective", billions of people actually don\'t matter all. It may sound so harsh, but think about the many countries of the world with millions of population and realize that their total GDP is less than the cash sitting idle on Berkshire Hathaway balance sheet.\n\nOr think of this perspective: What would happen if their disposable income was magically 10x tomorrow? What goods and services would they spend their money on? Is it really the local goods and services that would benefit from the overall increase in GDP - of course to a great extent - but is it really a handful of companies in the world that would actually benefit disproportionately from this wealth increase when that happens? If everybody in India could afford iPhones would they buy something else instead? Or would they be able to produce a competing good or a service locally that the entire world would consume? Would the money really flow elsewhere?\n\nOr are they really late in the game anyway, as we already argued that in the wealth creation game only the most recent period matters.\n\nSince the dot-com bubble era, I\'d argue that a lot of things have changed. It is interesting because dot-com bubble was the classic innovation pattern - people knew internet was the next big thing but it was not exactly clear who the winners in the next decades would be. 20 years since, we know who the winners are. We know what business models work, what business models can scale, have network effects and become profitable and so on. Horses vs cars was another classical example. You did not have to be a genius to realize cars would take over horses but time was harsh to many car companies in that there was no one single winner. It was by design of the product it became commoditized. Same can be argued for air travel. Internet however is different. While new business models emerge, consolidation and monopolistic effects are far more real - it\'s a world big becomes bigger as it employs smartest people, outbids competition, and constantly innovates.\n\nOf course there is no guarantee this will go on like this. After all, if you look at top 10 companies in the S&amp;P 500 for each of the past several decades, you will see interesting results. How will the next big thing overthrow the existing giants when big always get bigger, especially when they benefit from the overall wealth increase in every corner of the world? Perhaps it will be a new technology or maybe a catastrophe that can trigger this. While I\'d never want to guess the future, I am inclined to think as long as the status-quo peace continues, certain companies in the world - as they keep their innovative pace - will continue to dominate.\n\nIs the market expensive? It sure is. But what will happen tomorrow if GOOG, AAPL, AMZN drop by 20% tomorrow? Wouldn\'t people rush to put their entire wealth the next day? Sure multiples can contract. But is a 25bps/50bps move in rates going to destroy these companies? Would it make them worth less? Yes discounted cash flows should be lower and they may be growing 15% instead of 20%. But 5 years from now, are we going to see something similar to dot-com bubble where things don\'t recover?\n\nBut where else can the money go when your disposable income will be spent on that next iPhone, or half your time is spent on instagram/whatsapp/youtube/google, your businesses use Microsoft and its products and that does not going to change "that easily". These are important as indices are market-cap weighted indices. So we need a correction in big-tech more than anything else.\n\nNone of this is against the argument that the markets will not correct. However, I do not think the examples of dot-com era or 08\' are not justified. I think something "bigger" than 25bps increase in rates is needed for US markets to crash and stay at those levels for longer periods of time. And I did not even go into the demographic changes here which is a totally different animal on its own.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts.

Powell: The Fed will ensure that higher inflation does not become entrenched\n\nPowell said in his speech that the U.S. economy is growing rapidly and the labor market is strong. It can begin to see that the economy may be different in some ways after the new crown epidemic, and the pursuit of the Fed\'s goals needs to take these differences into account. To that end, the Fed\'s monetary policy must remain broad and forward-looking, keeping pace with the evolving economy.\n\nPowell said the U.S. Congress has designated important goals for the Fed and given the latter considerable independence to use its tools to achieve those goals. This independence comes with the responsibility to be transparent and communicate clearly, to keep the public informed and to achieve effective legislative oversight. This responsibility is particularly important when the Fed must take extraordinary action in times of crisis. Powell said he would commit to continuing this practice if he is confirmed for a second term as Fed chairman.\n\n2.

TPG has been established for 30 years and has a good reputation, but because it is not a public company, the financial situation can only be seen in a fog. Is it better to take advantage of TPG\'s reputation to charge the stock market, or to slow down and think about one question first - why is a company that has not been listed for 30 years, suddenly listed?\n\nTPG\'s S1 can be described as extremely complex, 459 pages long (only some time ago Rivian was listed less than 300 pages). Of course, the complexity of S1 proves that the company is willing to disclose, whether you can read it or not is up to your level. You think the purpose of a company going public is just to make money, naive. tpg this round of listing, play is a major transfer of assets.\n\nLet\'s start with the big picture. According to the company\'s S1 disclosure, this round of IPO listing, shaving off the old shareholder China Life to sell shares and listing underwriting costs, TPG expected revenue will be $ 820 million (after the green shoe).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lcpio18z0mb81.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a39fefb7c9e5422dc65f1c41f0f4a9e87ded388\n\nYou\'d think the $820 million would go into the company\'s books, but no, the $820 million would first have to go to the company\'s old shareholders (non-China Life shareholders) for $380 million. Normally, a prospectus can clearly show which old shareholders are selling their shares to exit, but this prospectus does not show that at all. It just says that the $380 million will go to the senior shareholders of a company called TPG Operating Group.\n\nThe public offering is of TPG Partners stock, but TPG Partners is a shell company and the real operating company is TPG Operating Group, which is a very powerful move because the shareholders of TPG Operating Group are completely hidden, so it is not known how the $380 million will be distributed to the senior shareholders. The operation of TPG Operating Group was also well hidden through this operation.\n\nThe real problem is the transfer of assets since TPG went public. The prospectus did not hide the fact that this operation was called "reorganization", and the chart below shows the structure of the company before and after the "reorganization" in the prospectus.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jq56g5c41mb81.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c319044e8e8c4dc39dc76f125dccda0a96ade7ed\n\nThrough this IPO, all institutional/retail shareholders received 11% of the actual company and 1.4% of the voting rights, but this does not reflect the true transfer of assets at all.\n\nAccording to page 126 of the prospectus, in addition to the old shareholders taking $380 million in cash, the old shareholders also divested $1.15 billion of TPG Operating Group\'s assets through a number of operations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3u1scag91mb81.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d2add2414898cfd58f2b58db9622f7bf2533c6\n\nThis includes $0.8 billion in cash and two large investments (one $720 million and one $250 million). The $720 million investment is not a public investment and the $250 million is from TPG Group Holdings (SBS). According to the data of the care book, the cost of this investment in 2019 is $180 million, which means that the two-year return reaches 34%.\n\nI do not know what consideration the old shareholders of TPG have taken to divest this $1.1 billion asset from the assets of the listed company, and of course the prospectus will not explain. But this kind of operation will inevitably make people feel that the company has the suspicion of divesting good assets and listing bad assets. If this were listed on the SSE, 100% would receive an inquiry letter from the SEC.\n\nIt is usually thought that a company listed, at most, is A shares and B shares, two kinds of equity. But TPG\'s IPO has created 4 types of shares: ordinary A shares, non-voting A shares, B shares and Common Unit, and it is really a master of equity operation.\n\n**Company News**\n\n**TPG Partners (TPG): IPO offer price $29.50, opened at $33, up 15%.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qtrggfqa1mb81.png?width=1838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b2fb5fcf189f0704882cc3546bfb06cbe605b8f\n\n**Ford Motor (F): Market cap topped $100 billion for the first time, up 5.7% today and up 2% by the close of trading.** Ford\'s market cap now exceeds that of General Motors (GM) and Rivian (RIVN), but still lags significantly behind Tesla (TSLA).'), ('Long-term TSLA savior', 'Long-term TSLA savior'), ('i SPY some trouble', 'i SPY some troublelong term we are still bullish if we hold above 458. i havent changed my stance. however, on the daily short term we are in a clear downward channel with 472 being our point of heavy resistance (thanks to two daily candles being rejected in a row there)\ntoday i will be watching for 2 key resistance to break before i jump on calls.\nif we can hold support here without dipping below 463.4-464 thats overall bullish. \nresistance is going to come into play at 466.6 ---&gt; 467.5 (where we bounced before dipping lower and where we rejected to candles after hours... this is the true resistance) ---&gt; if we can break 467.5 we should retest the hard resistance at 472. theres a very real chance we are rejected there. \n\nif we fall below that 463.4 ill be looking for a 459 bounce. \n\nthough if we initially hold support, futures stay green and bitty to stays green i will buy the next  OTM call 14 DTE at open.

I\'ll keep this at a Barney-level of elementary so you guys can understand the content.\n\nI\'m tired of seeing the "stock went up but I still lost money. HELP!?!?!" posts.\n\nComplicated concepts are just made up of smaller concepts.\n\nLet\'s begin.\n\n**Fundamentals I: The Basics)**\n\nAn option is the right but not the obligation (hence: option) to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock (the *underlying* asset) at a specified price (*strike price*) and expiration date.\n\n**A call is the right to buy 100 shares; a put is the right to sell 100 shares**\n\n**Intrinsic value:** Value of an option at expiration\n\n**Extrinsic value:** Value of an option at current price minus value of option at expiration (additional value derived from time and volatility rather than inherent, intrinsic value)\n\nIf you buy a $300c on $MSFT, and the stock gains $10, you gain $1000 of intrinsic value ($10 x 100) as long as the option is **in the money (ITM)**. ITM means that the option is above the strike price. The advantage is that an ITM option retains its value better, but is more expensive and offers less leverage per dollar, though has the same actual 100x leverage.\n\nIf the stock is BELOW the strike price, it is considered **out of the money (OTM)**. This means that the option is inherently worthless. The point of an OTM option is that it is cheaper, offers the same leverage, and has proportionately more leverage per dollar. The disadvantage is that it decays and loses value quickly if the stock goes down. Think *Feast or Famine.* **This is the spirit of WSB.**\n\n**At The Money (ATM)** means that the option is at or very near to the strike price of an option. If you couldn\'t extrapolate that the advantages/disadvantages of this option are between ITM and OTM, please stop reading and disable options access in your Robinhood account.\n\n**Fundamentals II: The Greeks)**\n\nThere are variables that describe the change in value of an option over time, volatility, and price. These are called "The Greeks". You don\'t have to memorize the exact definition, but you should know what each of them mean.\n\nIn actuality, there are at least 16 Greeks. First-order, second-order, and third-order to describe rate of change of rate of change of (nonsense). You don\'t have to know that many.\n\nHere are the main ones:\n\n**Delta: Change in option price per $1 change in the underlying stock**\n\n**Gamma: Change in option Delta per $1 change in the underlying stock**\n\n**Theta: Decay of an option price per day of passed time**\n\n**Vega: Change of an option\'s price per 1% change of implied volatility**\n\n**Rho: You don\'t need to know what this is. Option price change vs Interest rates. Barely matters. I\'m including it because you autists use Robinhood and it\'s on there.**\n\n*Q: "Why are these important?"*\n\n*A: Because you can still lose money when a stock goes the "right" direction of your Delta, but Theta and Vega gut your option beyond profit. For example, earnings calls - Volatility drops intensely after the earnings call, and since both puts and calls have positive Vega, you will lose a LOT of value due to Vega.*\n\nTakeaway: Directionality is NOT enough to make profit off of an option. An ATM call or put has, on average, a 33% chance of profit.\n\n**Fundamentals III: The Elusive Intelligent Play)**\n\nUnderstanding option mechanics is NOT enough to make intelligent moves. Shorting volatility on earnings is statistically positive, yet barely better than guessing even though it\'s the "right" move. \n\nTake, for example, an ATM TSLA call. Do you know what the profit trajectory looks like? It looks like this:\n\n[TSLA ATM CALL](https://preview.redd.it/0v66erz6lub81.png?width=559&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c836cd1e16c2cfe7d381ebfb8e5cd7c25d028c2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf people knew that this is what they were agreeing to when they bought an option, much fewer people would participate. OTM options are even worse:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA ATM CALL](https://preview.redd.it/thgxd8p9lub81.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aa4141ceba39668a17bff67b94e7fdbcb117227)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nITM options are weaker, but still unimpressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA ITM CALL](https://preview.redd.it/3632951blub81.png?width=548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4948fe3971b48db878c229d28c3b48e7c590b04e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals IV: Turning a Profit)**\n\nSo what is an option good for? Luckily, if you are illegally using insider information, then options are a great choice to multiply you information advantage! If that doesn\'t apply to you, then you can use them as lottery tickets to scalp sharp price swings for the greatest amount of leverage possible.\n\nIf you expect slow but certain price movements, then you may prefer LEAPs, Margin, or Spreads. \n\nBeware leveraged ETFs: The max drawdown can offset profits. For example, a 10% drawdown turns into a 30% drawdown with 3x leverage. Your position goes from 100% to 70%. Upon regaining 10%, you regain 30%. Your position is now at 91% of its original value. Unless you have an infinite bank roll, losses are more severe than gains of equal magnitude.\n\nA 50% gain can be lost if you give back 33%\n\nA 50% loss can be recovered if you gain 100%\n\n**This is why overallocation in a zero-sum game will ultimately lead to $0, and it\'s easy to overallocate with leverage. This applies to every form of leverage and volatility. Granted, that\'s the spirit of wsb. This is why a casino will win with only a 51% advantage and also why they have max bets. You are facing off against insiders, analyst firms, and HFTs, all while you don\'t have an infinite bankroll, so your advantage is sub-50%.**\n\n*Q: "How do I turn a profit?"*\n\nA: Get lucky, obtain an information advantage, or invest long-term to reap inflation &amp; appreciation\n\n*Q: "How do I get an information advantage?"*\n\nA: With hyper-autistic levels of DD, or befriend a senator/other insider.\n\n*Q: "Okay thanks, that\'s everything"*\n\nA: I\'m glad you asked. An option spread is a combination of two or more options together to form a play. The advantages are that you can negate Theta, Vega, and even short volatility without having to sell naked (which is not an option on the Robinhood platform). You may recognize the term "Box spread" from a particular retard who made Robinhood change their terms and conditions.\n\nHere is an ATM call debit spread on TSLA ($1045c 1/21 buy, $1050c 1/21 sell for $258 entry $500 max profit):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[TSLA ATM CALL DEBIT SPREAD](https://preview.redd.it/3ylgs3rkoub81.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d52f98cb900aae5264619f7bf8099040c1fede19)\n\nA 48% chance to almost double your money is much more in line with what most of you are looking for. Double $8k four times and you will have around $128k.\n\nAdvantages: Neutral theta (positive or negative depending on whether it\'s ITM or OTM), little to no Vega, very efficient leverage, cheap option spread (the pictured above only costs $258 to enter). You retain a lot of value near expiration if the stock is not going your way. Look at -2% from 2 days out on the above chart. You lose roughly half of your spread\'s value despite being OTM and very close to expiry. However, as I will mention again soon: The lower liquidity will likely make this a worse deal upon entry and exit.\n\nDisadvantage: Much less opportunity to scalp. Option is meant to expire to receive full value, so you\'re usually riding the option until it\'s dead. On rare occasions, the ITM option you sold may be exercised, but your broker is supposed to take care of this for you. There is less liquidity, so you will have a harder time entering and exiting trades at fair prices since you\'re eating liquidity two times upon entry, and two times upon exit (if you choose to exit at any point).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYOLO $TSLA 1150c 1/21'), ('Absolutely retarded apebrained 2x leveraged 60/40 S&amp;P 500 / long term treasury portfolio - looking for feedback', 'Absolutely retarded apebrained 2x leveraged 60/40 S&amp;P 500 / long term treasury portfolio - looking for feedbackHey gang, rate my portfolio \n\nMy investment strategy  relies on modern portfolio theory principles of improving risk-adjusted  return over long periods by holding uncorrelated risky assets Assumptions: Covariance, efficient frontier, tangency portfolio, capital allocation line and all those Markowitz MPT concepts are still relevant, long term treasuries will continue to be negatively correlated with stocks and not get killed by expected rising interest rates, the "flight to safety" phenomenon that makes LTTs an effective hedge will still occur during crashes, and the Fed won\'t return to pre-1982 Volcker monetary policy where treasuries were also callable. \n\nWe find the  stock/bond allocation that achieves the efficient frontier (anywhere from 40/60 to 60/40) and apply leverage to the tangent portfolio along  the capital allocation line to beat a 100% stock portfolio. Using  leveraged ETFs prevents the risk of margins calls. I\'m not concerned  about "volatility decay" for leveraged ETFs when the underlying has  positive expected returns (e.g. not commodities or gold) and the  leverage is reasonable (no more than 3x). \n\nThe leveraged stock  ETFs drive very strong returns during bull markets. The "flight to  safety" makes the leveraged long-term treasury ETF an effective hedge.  We want long-term term treasuries because they are more volatile than  shorter-duration bonds, have 0 credit risk vs corporate bonds, and have a  highest degree of negative correlation (around -0.37) to stocks  compared to other assets. \n\nTherefore, with leverage applied  they\'re the best candidate for counteracting the downward movement of a  leveraged stock position during a crash. Yes, they provided good returns  over the last 30 years as interest rates were cut. I don\'t expect them  to do so moving forward, but in any case they are here solely as crash  insurance. \n\nIntrinsically, we’re relying on US stocks and  long-term treasuries not crashing in tandem, which is a tail risk I am  willing to incur. A fundamental assumption is that the US will not  return to pre-Volcker monetary policy. That is, there will be no runaway  stagflation like the late 1970’s where treasuries were also callable. \n\nWill  recent QE tapering increase the risk of this? Who knows, but I wouldn\'t  bet against J-Pow and the Fed money printer. In my opinion upcoming  interest rate hikes have been priced in and will not substantially hurt  long bonds over a sufficient time horizon. \n\nMy asset allocation is UPRO/SPY/TMF/TLT 30/30/20/20. This produces 2x leverage on a traditional 60/40 portfolio with a final stock/bond allocation of 120/80. \n\nI  rebalance quarterly or if one asset exceeds a 15% band. I sell the  overperformers and put the proceeds into the underperformers until I hit  my target asset allocation. This makes it braindead easy to sell high,  buy low.  \n\nConvince me that I\'m wrong, I\'m looking for an excuse to YOLO into GME or TSLA FDs instead.'), ("I buy SPY becuase I'm an broke.

If that fails it shluld be a pretty clear indication we will head back down to that lower support of the channel near 458-459. That support is key to preventing a massive sell off. If we fall back down below 50 ema and break the 458 area we are headed towards 400. \n\nIn my opinion bears best opportunity will be the rally to 471, followed by a strong rejection to retest 459 support line and hope that fails. \n\n\nHow i am playing next week:\nI carried a 2/18 46C thats already up over the weekend. I honestly wasnt sure i was going to but its up too much and i feel too much of a shift to bullish not too. \n\nMy guess will be we see a run to 471 Tuesday. I will be holding my call until we get there and may even load up another one at market open if we hold the 50 ema. I will sell at 471 in anticipation we get rejected. \n\nIf we actually get rejected at 471 im fully anticipating a dip to 460. I will load up on puts for the dip (most likely ill wait till she falls back below the 20 ema to do this though for confirmation). Definitely play the classic 50 ema to 20 ema and 20 ema to 50 ema move. \n\nIf for some reason we open market bloody Tuesday ill sell my call at market open and grab a put knowing we should retest 460. \n\nI am a little worried about another 458-460 retest and whether she will hold or not. \n\nPostion: neither bear nor bull but holding 2/18 462C'), ('White Gold Rush: Lithium America’s Corp (LAC)', 'White Gold Rush: Lithium America’s Corp (LAC)Currently those commies in China control 80% of the worlds Lithium supply.

Great, now we know which companies to look for, but where do we find such great companies that are safer bets than these other cheap ones? The answer is all around you.

It is not a want.**  \n**COST is a need. It is not a want.**  \n\n\nBig investment companies know this, and they will always buy these stocks, no matter what.\n\nThese are companies that will ALWAYS be around unless something catastrophic happens.

We found out if the company **ADDS VALUE** to the rest of the world and that is what makes it attractive to both new and old investors. We found out that this company will keep going up, aside from some minor setbacks and profit taking. We found out that overall, a long term play on this company is **MORE THAN LIKELY** going to work out. Awesome and great.  \n\n\n5.

(If you are DAYTRADING, that is completely different)  \n\n\nI am about to give you guys a huge secret on how to many fat cash because I see so many other people do it. When you see the stock hit the 100/180 SMA, this is where you load. This is where all the "heavy/smart/big" investors will also load. They load here with long dated calls and lots of stock, and they fucking wait 1-3 months to reap the rewards. Generally this occurs more on an ETF than a stock, but a good stock will have this happen aswell. Don\'t believe me? Okay, let\'s check out the SPY to compare.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[SPY DAILY \\(d\\) CHART](https://preview.redd.it/5xbiubbip9c81.png?width=1734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4db6ab72e814516b071915c5a170117ce99e968)\n\n  \nFunny, seems that if you loaded 1-3 month out spy calls every time in the last 2 years that the SPY hit the 100/180ish SMA it always rebounded. Government buying or not, it\'s what happened. EVERY SINGLE TIME, if you bought 1-3 month out calls, they would have printed. **EVERY, SINGLE, TIME.**  \nI believe this is also called "The Golden Rule" or some other super smart investor term, idk.  \n\n\nSo, to summarize what we have learned: We find good companies with good financials and good backing, put it on our watchlist and set alerts for key points of support. We trade the confirmation, not the hunch.

Perhaps you heard of this company through a friend or with positive news? Is this your first time looking at the stock? Doesn\'t matter .Open the chart, put it on the D (daily) or W (weekly) chart. LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE. Are you in a downtrend? Uptrend? What is going on with the stock? Have people been pushing it up for 2 weeks and you\'re just NOW thinking about getting calls? NO!\n2. **THIS IS THE PART WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AT :** What are their fundamentals? You want to look at 2 big things here above all else. **Free flow cash, and Long term debt.** These are the 2 most important things I look at when I determine if I am going to BUY(long) or SELL(short) a position. There is no exceptions. This is also what big name institutions are going to look at right off the rip aswell.\n\nExample\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp7cchqh4ac81.png?width=1663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75210e77f38d6969b13f26296dec79b37e450087\n\nZIM FINANCIALS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4mkpqpi4ac81.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6ba3edb43a1cd696171fc0f666051d8739ec65c\n\nZIM CHART\n\nNow, let\'s compare this to... idk, PLTR for instance since so many morons love this company who\'s CEO get\'s lost in the woods smoking weed and making insane investor videos that never work out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62t6auqj4ac81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=027a7d7b414b412e3efd5fdd0e410b1834c5d8df\n\nPLTR FINANCIALS\n\nAnd the chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrcg8i5l4ac81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f18fdedf5cf808467e8a114e70d582bfa56fcd9f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPLTR CHART\n\n3. Great, now we know which companies to look for, but where do we find such great companies that are safer bets than these other cheap ones? The answer is all around you. Think, what companies will ALWAYS be around? I\'m not talking about tech companies or that kind of thing, what are humans ALWAYS going to **NEED?** Housing, Food, Energy, (all types) Safety, Materials, etc. Keep in mind, you\'re separating the NEED from the WANT here,\n\n**HD is a need. It is not a want.**  \n**COST is a need. It is not a want.**\n\nBig investment companies know this, and they will always buy these stocks, no matter what.\n\nThese are companies that will ALWAYS be around unless something catastrophic happens. I pulled up a chart of some 500 companies and circled the ones I would choose to go after.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18npgdam4ac81.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=294315696ff8549d1a2f133456e37e188781743b\n\n4. Okay great, Now we found what company we want to buy, we found out multiple other things aswell. We found out if the company **ADDS VALUE** to the rest of the world and that is what makes it attractive to both new and old investors. We found out that this company will keep going up, aside from some minor setbacks and profit taking. We found out that overall, a long term play on this company is **MORE THAN LIKELY** going to work out. Awesome and great.\n\n5. The setup\n\nAlright, now let\'s say we wanna buy some company that will yield us a good return (long calls/ stock) like COST or HD. Let\'s pull up the charts then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvpwds3n4ac81.png?width=1155&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c34a9ce43da6af45aa54bcf4df7abd3d1e7afba2\n\nCOST CHART\n\nNaturally, we want to want to **LOAD AT SUPPORT**. (IE: WHERE THE RED LINE IS ON THIS CHART OR BELOW IT AT PREVIOUS SUPPORT) Not just randomly jump into a run on a random day at a random time. (If you are DAYTRADING, that is completely different)\n\nI am about to give you guys a huge secret on how to make fat cash because I see so many other people do it. When you see the stock hit the 100/180 SMA, this is where you load. This is where all the "heavy/smart/big" investors will also load. They load here with long dated calls and lots of stock, and they fucking wait 1-3 months to reap the rewards. Generally this occurs more on an ETF than a stock, but a good stock will have this happen aswell. Don\'t believe me? Okay, let\'s check out the SPY to compare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6ratl9o4ac81.png?width=1734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2e45febd3d5786986f90da972adf5e1f62be507\n\nSPY DAILY (d) CHART\n\nFunny, seems that if you loaded 1-3 month out spy calls every time in the last 2 years that the SPY hit the 100/180ish SMA it always rebounded. Government buying or not, it\'s what happened. EVERY SINGLE TIME, if you bought 1-3 month out calls, they would have printed. **EVERY, SINGLE, TIME**.\n\nI believe this is also called "The Golden Rule" or some other super smart investor term, idk.\n\nSo, to summarize what we have learned: We find good companies with good financials and good backing, put it on our watchlist and set alerts for key points of support. We trade the confirmation, not the hunch. Like if you\'re day trading, you trade the breakout not the chart.\n\nI hope this makes sense to everyone I\'ve tried to make it as simple as possible, if you have any questions please feel free to comment below or DM me directly. If you feel like I am wrong in any way with what I have said here, then please, feel free to make your own post.\n\nSide note: I am not some kind of Jim Simmons Guru, nor do I claim to be. Just someone that knows how this stuff works on a machine-like aspect.\n\n**Hope this helps.**'), ('Headlines: Fear grips the heart!

King is the only non-U.S. president to be honored to date, and the only African-American to enjoy this honor.\n\nBorn on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, King delivered his famous speech "I Have a Dream" on August 28, 1963. He and several leaders of the civil rights movement pushed for the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, which outlawed segregation and racial discrimination.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vzef6j5zc7c81.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f1beb3e0c2e113229ba449386dc209adeb63cba\n\n**After the Fed\'s March rate hike, it will be difficult to communicate future policy direction to the outside world**\n\nAs the Fed\'s January meeting approaches, officials are less confident that inflation will fall below 3% by year-end, as expected, and have begun to say that they may need to raise rates sooner than expected.\n\nThis month, a number of officials raised the possibility of a rate hike in March and the possibility of needing to raise rates four times this year, or even five times. Just a few weeks ago, they were expecting three rate hikes in 2022; a shift that will overshadow the Jan. 25-26 meeting.\n\nIt also highlights one of the biggest challenges to providing policy guidance as the epidemic continues unabated: how can future policy actions be communicated to the outside world as economic data fluctuates up and down forcing the Fed to constantly revise its economic outlook.\n\n"Forward guidance has previously been a tool of expediency in the face of low inflation and downward inflationary pressures," said Derek Tang, economist at LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics in Washington. "If the risks are two-way or skewed to the upside, it\'s not clear if it\'s still sustainable."\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qknw2281d7c81.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f373989c68badf25e152c1dddfdcd5830ef24a8\n\n**Soaring U.S. Inflation Leads to Surge in Demand for Inflation-Protected Savings Bonds**\n\nThe government sold $2.78 billion in Series I savings bonds in December, after previously selling $1.07 billion of such bonds in November, according to the U.S. Treasury. the December figure was $1 billion more than the record annual high set in 2018, when rising oil prices pushed inflation to 3%.\n\nIn December 2021, the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.5 percent from a year earlier and 7 percent from a year earlier, the biggest year-over-year increase in 40 years since June 1982, according to data released last Wednesday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe only positive factor was a slower year-over-year increase - 0.8% in November 2021 compared to 0.9% in October. Excluding food and energy, which have volatile prices, the consumer price index rose 5.5% year-over-year in December.\n\nIn fact, demand would have increased even more if the government had not placed a $10,000 per person per year limit on buying the bond online.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhipay42d7c81.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9dfd73a3273a2683dc5cc7bdcd85a8d3bae536f\n\n**Wal-Mart is quietly preparing to enter the meta-universe**\n\nSince Facebook announced it was changing its company name to Meta to signal its ambition to move beyond social media, numerous companies have been rushing to figure out how to fit into the virtual world, says trademark attorney Josh Gerben.\n\nWalmart appears to be trying to enter the meta-universe with plans to create its own cryptocurrency and NFT.\n\nThe major retailer filed several new trademarks late last month indicating its intention to manufacture and sell virtual goods, including electronics, home decor, toys, sporting goods and personal care products. In a separate filing, the company said it will offer virtual currency as well as NFTs to users.\n\nWalmart filed the application on Dec. 30 last year, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

The Nasdaq Composite Index fell for the third straight week.\n\nSome high-flying growth stocks are bearing the brunt of the growing belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon begin withdrawing the massive monetary stimulus that has been in place since the outbreak of the epidemic.\n\nData this week showed that U.S. consumer prices rose last year at the biggest rate since June 1982, and U.S. retail sales fell the most in 10 months in December, suggesting that higher prices may have kept consumers on the sidelines, all of which fueled concerns about interest rate hikes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m27ys746d7c81.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddd9644077fc6bd42d066c7b75302d243063e6ad\n\n**Vito Group: Oil Prices Could Rise More Due to Tight Supply**\n\nCrude oil prices, which have risen more than 10 percent this year, could rise even more because of tight supplies, the world\'s largest independent oil trader said.\n\n"These prices are reasonable," Mike Muller, head of Asia for the Vidor Group, said Sunday. "Strong spot premiums are very reasonable," he said, referring to a bullish pattern in which short-term futures are more expensive than later futures.\n\nOil rose for the fourth straight time last week, its longest streak since October, with signs that oil consumption will keep growing despite the spread of the Omnicron variant. Meanwhile, idle capacity is declining as some of the world\'s largest producers work to boost output.\n\nBrent crude is up 11 percent this year to more than $86 a barrel, extending last year\'s 50 percent gain.\n\nWhile natural gas prices have climbed enough to cause some industrial users, including Pakistan and Europe, to reduce consumption, the oil market has not yet reached that point, Mueller said.'), ("Chartists out there - opinions on my simple crazy crayon drawings, please.

The number of Fed rate hikes this year is expected to increase from three to four (in March, June, September and December, respectively), with each hike of 25 basis points.

I have developed a system that I use in part of one of my accounts that has been working well, so I thought I would share it with anyone who is interested.  \n\nMy goals with the system were:\n\n1. To participate in longer-term market uptrends, but to step aside during downtrends (IOW, to engage in overall market timing), while at the same time,\n2. To smooth out returns by scaling in and out as the market moves up and down along its uptrend path.\n\nAnother way to put that is that I wanted to combine value and momentum, but on an overall market basis rather than on a stock-by-stock basis as it is usually described.  \n\nSo, while SPY is in an uptrend I want to be onboard, but I want to reduce my exposure as it runs up toward overbought conditions.  Then, when it pulls back, I want to increase my position to take advantage of the next runup.  Finally, when the short-term pullback turns into a longer-term drawdown, I want to get out completely and wait for the next longer-term uptrend.\n\nI also want to do all of this without making any guesses, forecasting, following news, etc.  I want it to be a purely mathematical system that could be traded by a computer.

Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard', 'Pick up cheap or junk? Microsoft acquires Activision BlizzardRecently, the game industry has made great moves. First, take two, the developer of Grand Theft Auto, announced last week that it had spent $12.7 billion to acquire Zynga, a social game giant, setting a new high in the game industry. Unexpectedly, just a week later, this record was easily rewritten, and the scale directly doubled five times.\n\nRecently, Microsoft announced without warning that it would buy game giant Activision Blizzard for us $68.7 billion. At present, the transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both parties. If approved by the regulatory authorities, it is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2023 (from the fourth quarter of this year).\n\nAfter the acquisition, Microsoft will acquire the operation and management rights of all studios of Activision Blizzard and its subsidiary king, and surpass Nintendo to become the third largest game company in terms of revenue in the world, second only to Tencent holdings and Sony.\n\n**Game giant**\n\nActivision Blizzard was formed by the merger of Activision and blizzard in 2007. It is one of the giants in the game industry. Its games have nearly 400 million monthly live users. Activision Blizzard currently has more than 10000 employees, including demonware, digital legends, high moon studios, major league gaming, radical entertainment and many other well-known game studios in the industry.\n\nIt has many world-famous game IP, such as call of duty, Warcraft, StarCraft, hearthstone legend, etc. when these games are incorporated into Xbox in the future, they will become the core competitiveness of Microsoft\'s game business in an all-round competition with Sony.\n\nOn the surface, Activision Blizzard, a game giant, is really good, but in fact, its loyal users of many games are generally the post-80s and post-90s, and have been "cooking cold rice" and "selling feelings", which has a limited impact on the new generation of young people, and the price of us $68.7 billion is not cheap. Even fans of Blizzard games said: "I\'m disappointed that I didn\'t wait for Blizzard to go bankrupt", "Microsoft is really too rich, Blizzard is not worth the price", "it\'s hard to imagine that such a large sum of money will buy a \'mess\'.".\n\n**How silly is Microsoft?**\n\nThe merger will be conducted in full cash plus a premium of 45%. The price of US $68.7 billion is not only the largest acquisition in the global game industry, but also the largest acquisition made by Microsoft since its establishment in 1975. If the acquisition fails, Microsoft will also pay a $3 billion breakup fee.\n\nIt can be seen that Microsoft\'s determination to Activision Blizzard is inevitable. During the conference call, both parties were also full of confidence and were very satisfied with the transaction.\n\nHowever, some people in the market doubt that Activision Blizzard is in trouble. Will Microsoft\'s acquisition feel a little "wronged"?\n\nBased on the predicted EBITDA of Activision Blizzard for the whole year of 2021 of US $3.7 billion, the P / E ratio of this transaction is between 18 and 19 times; Based on the forecast revenue of Activision Blizzard for the whole year of 2021 of US $8.7 billion, the market sales ratio is 7-8 times, which is higher than the industry average.\n\nPreviously, due to the company\'s culture condoning sexual harassment, there was a significant difference in the salary of male and female employees. Activision Blizzard was continuously subject to class lawsuits by California regulators and company employees. This is just the beginning of all kinds of troubles of activism blizzard. The company\'s extremely harmful internal culture exists not only in the blizzard Department originally targeted by the California lawsuit, but in the wider scope of the company.\n\nTo make matters worse, the latest call of duty released by Activision Blizzard seems to have performed poorly, the score at the time of release is below the standard, and the subsequent data also show that its sales are weak. Some analysts predict that the fourth quarter results of Activision Blizzard will be released on February 3 will be less than expected, which is a rare phenomenon.\n\nThe various troubles of Activision Blizzard led to its weak stock price performance. Last year, unlike the unusually hot stock market in the United States, the company\'s stock price fell all the way after reaching a high of $104.6 in February, reaching a minimum of $56.4 in December.\n\n**God closed the door of Blizzard, but opened a "windows" for him.**\n\nThe sharp drop in Blizzard\'s share price also brought opportunities for Microsoft\'s "low price" acquisition. Although the purchase price of $95 per share was 45% higher than the closing price of the stock the previous trading day, it was only 4% higher than the level before the California government sued the company for so-called gender discrimination in mid July last year.\n\nLast year, the overall revenue of Microsoft\'s game Department increased by US $357 million, with an increase rate of 11%. However, the performance of Xbox is amazing. The hardware revenue has increased by 172%, becoming the best-selling game console in Microsoft\'s history, with more than 25 million subscribers. However, there is a significant gap with the top two Sony and Nintendo. The acquisition of Blizzard will give it the latest impetus to catch up with its peers.\n\n**Layout meta universe**\n\nMicrosoft has all the cloud computing, intelligent devices and software needed by metauniverse. After the acquisition of Blizzard and rich game IP content, Microsoft is bound to take a share in metauniverse.\n\nEven some netizens have set specific strategies for Microsoft. For example, launch the meta universe game: the main content is to auction the land next to the famous scenes in the game. The slogan helps you think: do you want to be a neighbor of Alsace? Want to sleep in your own Daiwa warship? Want to get close to the DVA? Please join StarCraft watch world.\n\nFor another example, change all the dark gold equipment of Diablo 4 under development to NFT, and introduce Diablo coin, which will be dropped by 5 bosses in kill hell mode. Add the equipment creation function. Two pieces of dark gold and dark coins can be upgraded to super dark gold. If you continue to build, you can continue to upgrade.\n\nBlizzard\'s merger and acquisition has plunged countless game fans into crazy reverie. Tribes and alliances are afraid to fight in the yuan universe in the future.\n\n**Bottom Blizzard?**\n\nAfter the announcement of the acquisition, Activision Blizzard soared by more than 30% yesterday and finally closed up 25.88, closing at 82.31, 15.4% away from the acquisition price of $95.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the acquisition process will generally last about a year, and it will certainly be reviewed by the regulatory authorities. Even if the review is passed, it does not rule out that the final acquisition agreement will have a discount of 10% - 25%, and the corresponding share price is $80.75 to $85.5. In other words, there is no excessive premium for Blizzard\'s share price at present.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft\'s share price did not rise yesterday, but fell by 2.43%, which shows that investors are not very satisfied with the acquisition.\n\nTherefore, the current price bottom reading is not cost-effective. I suggest you focus on watching the excitement.'), ('🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA - Wednesday Jan. 19, 2022', '🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA - Wednesday Jan. 19, 2022[🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA - Tuesday Jan. 18, 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s5dpyc/i_spy_ta_tuesday_jan_18_2022/)\n\n# SPY - Jan. 19 - Technical Analysis\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtfif9v0fjc81.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=134bee81c2251ed20d954fd1b06b6c81d539b6f9\n\n**1/18 Recap:**\n\n* High: 459.94\n* Low: 455.31\n* Close: 456.49\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* Gapped down and didn’t look back (toasting my lottos 🤡)\n* Sell signal still in play from 1/13 (no buy signal triggered yet)\n* 65 min.

Disclosure: I am long Activision Blizzard and Microsoft.*\n\nBig news in the gaming world. Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to buy Activision Blizzard (ATVI) in an all-cash deal valued at about $75 billion (net of cash $68b), or $95 per share . This is the largest gaming industry acquisition ever, which crushed the previous record established last week when Take Two bought Zynga for $11 billion. The deal is also Microsoft’s biggest ever.\n\nMicrosoft offered a 45% premium. This is a hefty premium compared to where ATVI traded in recent months, but ATVI traded at higher prices one year ago (52-week high $104). The recent scandals have hurt ATVI.\n\nAt the moment, ATVI trades \\~$82 per share. This implies that the market is skeptical that the deal will close. There’s an arbitrage opportunity here. If the deal goes through, it offers a 16% upside. ATVI also distributes a small dividend once a year. Let’s discuss this arbitrage opportunity. .\n\nDisclosure: I am long ATVI and Microsoft. I’ve been a shareholder of both companies before the announcement. I’m pleased with the offer. I’m biased. I don’t see the risk the market does and that’s the issue. It’s not the capacity to pay. Microsoft has the cash and won’t dilute shareholders. So it sounds like possible antitrust issues. Is there anything else I’m missing?\n\nHere’s a brief background on both companies:\n\n**Activision Blizzard**\n\nIt’s no secret that the company behind blockbuster games like Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo is going through a rough patch, to say the least. I’m not going to rehash everything that happened (years of sexual harassment, discrimination, and misconduct). But what happened and how it was handled is business/PR 101 on what not to do.\n\nATVI’s reputation is damaged. Talent is leaving. There’s probably more skeletons in the closet. Bobby Kotick built a great company, great games, and rewarded shareholders very well along the way. But Kotick mismanaged the crisis and lost the trust of the gamers, public, employees, and the market. We don’t have the full story. I suspect more internal problems, more culture and development issues with games. And it’s not just the scandal, ATVI has made some missteps in the past.\n\nThe thing is the scandal would have followed the company for a long time. These things don’t go away easily. The media and the Internet will keep bringing up. And if you underperform operationally, game quality and growth is affected, the pressure will just keep going up. Your culture might be so tainted that gamers don’t want to be associated with your games. A crisis like that would have taken years to fix and in the process possibly lose your competitiveness and sales. Who knows if the stock would ever recover.\n\nWith this background, I understand why ATVI accepted the $95 cash offer. It’s probably better that ATVI is under a different home. Fix the issues away from the public. It’s been reported that Kotick will leave if and once the deal closes. In a sense it gives him a graceful exit.\n\n**Microsoft**\n\nMicrosoft has been making a lot of deals lately. WSJ reported that MSFT had long been interested in ATVI and had discussed a potential acquisition in the past.\n\nIf you are going to spend $75 billion for a business, you have big plans. It’s also telling of their gaming ambitions. For the last ten years MSFT has been boosting their gaming portfolio.\n\nFor the last ten years Microsoft has been boosting their gaming assets. Microsoft has been working on building the “Netflix” of gaming. A subscription based cloud gaming service. Cloud gaming is an emerging technology that allows people to stream games via nearly any internet-connected device (issue is that game requires a lot of data to run smoothly). And because Microsoft owns Azure, they have the cloud infrastructure to support such a strategy.\n\nThe strategy is to persuade gamers to abandon their expensive hardware and play on the cloud. If Microsoft could convert some of Activision’s close to 400 million monthly active users into subscribers, it could significantly bolster its cloud-game business.\n\n**Issues**\n\nI believe it comes down to antitrust. But because I’m set to benefit I don’t fully see the risk the market does. John Hempton from Bronte Capital brought up some of the same issues on a [thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/John_Hempton/status/1483540883333324802). But I don’t see anything substantial in the Twitter comments. I share some of his views. Here’s what I think and please let me know what I don’t see:\n\n* Is there a precedent where the Gov/Justice Department/FTC blocked a gaming transaction?\n* The deal is not expected to close for a while (ATVI Fiscal 2023) but that is still a big gap.\n* I think the #1 factor is Lina Khan, the chair of the FTC. She’s been very vocal about taking on big tech. She’s writing papers about. That’s why she got the job. The 32-year-old antitrust scholar and law professor is not Microsoft’s ally.\n* This deal poses an important test of the Biden Administration’s generally unfriendly view of large technology acquisitions.\n* However, from a regulatory perspective, Microsoft is not under the same level of scrutiny as other big tech (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google).\n* Microsoft will pay a $3 billion breakup fee if the deal doesn’t go through. This indicates to me that they are confident the deal will go through.\n* The games will need to be on multiple platforms (Playstation, PC, Nintendo, mobile etc…). If not it’s a deal breaker. The deal won’t get approved and you will get a gamer mutiny. And gamers are crazy.\n* Keeping the games multi-platform also makes business sense. If you fence off Call of Duty to only Xbox, you will kill part of the gamer community and hurt the branding. If you pay $75b you want to see some returns at the end of the day.\n* If these get hairy they might have to sell a couple titles.\n* I don’t think there’s too much concentration. In terms of gaming sales (excluding hardware) Microsoft is #4. Tencent, Sony and Apple have more gaming revenues. ATVI is #7. The deal will make Microsoft the third largest gaming company in terms of revenue.\n\nI think the deal will go through. Let’s hear other views and why.\n\nBrian'), ('Cramer tweet #meme $NFLX', 'Cramer tweet #meme $NFLX'), ('Hahaha.... $NFLX...I wonder 🤔 from $10 to.....🤑🤑🤑🤑?', 'Hahaha.... $NFLX...I wonder 🤔 from $10 to.....🤑🤑🤑🤑?'), ('Spy Calls or Puts?', 'Spy Calls or Puts?The spy has dropped 30$ + in a little more than 2 weeks.

I'm going to give you guys a few reasons why this will not be a full-on market crash.\n\n1. What is the catalyst causing the selloff?\n\nThe general consensus is that the raising of interest rates and hawkish approach from the fed is fueling the selloff. That news has been out for a long time and the fed has made it known for a while that rate hikes were coming. So whats causing the selling? Its the weak and scared money leaving the market.\n\n2. When was the last time that there were similar market conditions? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mux8r0ajscd81.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=431970a9bcd3b0cd63f6bf166e6b0d469c80f95b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lk3perbnscd81.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42d0f781ab45d62e4a573b19fb9a9b36128e66b5\n\nAt the end of 2015 the fed started to raise interest rates significantly for the first time since the early 2000s. As you can tell SPY took a fat dump leading up to and during the rate hikes. From top to bottom it suffered about a 15% drop and we are currently only down about 7%. That means there could be more downside ahead but guess what? Spy recovered then and will recover now. Fears of rate hikes should only be justified for causing market crashes if the fed does it too quickly. That brings me to my last point.\n\n3. Why JPOW and the fed won't fuck up by raising rates too quickly.\n\nThis is an election year and Biden is gonna be on JPOW's ass to not cause a crash of the economy so that people don't lose trust in the democrats. Trust me when I say Biden is gonna do a lot to prevent that. \n\nAs you can see by the chart above the fed fucked up by raising rates way too quickly throughout the late 2010s and they have learned from their mistake. 7% inflation is manageable when we have had near 2% inflation for the last 10 years. They don't need to raise rates quickly. It is possible and probable that the fed has small rate hikes every couple of months to ease us by reducing inflation by maybe 1% or less per year without crashing the economy. \n\nTLDR: This is a temporary correction but probably not the bottom")], '2022-01-24': [('Covered Calls?', "Covered Calls?My HELOC is allowing me to get more shares of AAPL.

However, take tesla for instance today... tesla was down 5% while spy was up nearly 2% and tesla finished down 11%. Even the otherday on Tuesday Microsoft was up while the market was down if i remember correctly (or inverse). Either way what im saying is one company will not hold the market up.

Its friday after all... but spy lovessss to switch it up. That resistance line (the green dotted) was so u believably strong it had been tested and rejected 6 times. But one ole Biden started speaking he whispered sweet nothings to the market and boom boom we broke the major resistance trend.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Z00hnlW.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cW0pqOE.jpeg\n\nIronically our sibling NASDAQ saw their similar downward channel break too. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/lelrP8G.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hr0Y5ol.jpeg\n\nOn NASDAQ we got the MACD curling up to sell and the RSI trending upward. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/StW61cG.jpeg\n\nOn spy we have a very similiar setup occuring too. https://i.imgur.com/PPJ4oCn.jpeg\n\nHeres what im seeing and where we may be headed and how im playing the month of February.\n\nSo nasdaq. Im seeing a clear break of the bear channel (blue dotted). But im seeing another clearly formed bullish channel (white dotted). Im seeing a resistance line near 14.1k (using previous high from 1/4 and 1/13 a perfect intersection happens at 14.1k at the top resistance line of the white dotted channel. Im also seeing the daily 20 ema intersecting around this area too. Will definitely be keeping an eye on this. \n\nNow with spy. We are looking at the red dotted bullish channel. Im watching a similiar trend line from 1/4 and 1/13 which intersects the top resistance line of the red dotted channel near 456. \n\nI note that SPYs channel is more aggressive than the NASDAQ channel. However both are on very similar trajectories here. \n\nNow one thing i will be watching is that even im this new bullish channel for spy is that we have a lot of downside still. The 30 min and 1 hour are still pretty overbought (not extremely but slightly). There is still a chance we see a major sell off sometime next week perhaps even monday. Currently support will be somewhere by time pre market moves and everything around 428-430. After such an impressive end of day run today it would be natural to expect some to be given back monday. \n\nHeres how im playing the next few weeks... (keep in mind im going back to work full time night shift so i also wont be able to day trade as much as i could the last 2 weeks).\n\nIm going to be watching the charts next week come monday and be looking for a small dip to go long on some calls here. I will be doing my normal style: first otm strike for whenever i finally buy in but im going to do a 14 dte. Will plan to hold for some nice profit and then roll it out depending on gains and everything provable every 7 days. \n\nIm going to be watching for the upper resistance line test near 448-450 short term next week and long term of 456 by 2nd week of February. \n\nI still hope to do some intraday trading but because of work im gonna be doing mostly longs holding and rolling profits unless i see a change of direction.\n\nOne thing everyone needs to watch out for is Feb 10th inflation data releasing. No more fed meetings till March so really from here we got some room to run free till the fed drops the hammer again.')], '2022-01-30': [('CSCW has a metaverse with Shaq… okay .. then I found this post of Aoki tagging him and he has a metaverse going on.

Dead cat bounce confirmed? 🤔🤔Really kind of a meh day. if you were patient and waited for a good entry this morning you are probably did okay.\n\nLast few days we have seen a small dip and then rip during power hour. I like to say don't fight the trend... however it appears today we saw a flip in that trend. We did not see the crazy after hours pop. \n\nSPY:\n\ntodays over all while kinda a sideways day but bullish. we tested and are held above the daily 100 ema of 454 which is extremely bullish.\n\nwe currently are looking at a daily MACD buy signal. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/JMgvwjr.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/liLJR8J.jpeg\n\nresistance wise we are looking at heavy heavy resistance at 458. We need to be able to breach that before we can see 460. \n\nThe close above 454 was a possible indication we are going to continue this short term bullish movement. However, after hours Meta (fb) just posted a massive miss (im assuming havent looked at report myself) but they are down an incredible 19% which im sure you can imagine is bringing QQQ and SPY down a significant amount. \n\nPrior to meta missing and dragging down SPY which broke our support line and currently has this down 0.7% after hours and clingly to dear life above the daily 100 ema of 454.... i would have suspected that tomorrow we would get a test of that 459.5 resistance however it looks like this bad news from meta just might be enough to kill the short term momentum. \n\nAs always do not fight the trend. We need to be careful to keep what we want separate from what its doing. I dont hold positions over night anymore especially during times like these. \n\nWe need to see how after hours and pre market sort out but tomorrow we may see the inverse of today which would be a small pop in morning followed by sell off. This very well could be confirming the dead cat bounce. We need to see how tomorrow shakes out but even without a 459 resistance test this could start its next phase of dip. \nAn important level i will be watching on the daily is the 5 ema  sitting at 449.6... a break below this would confirm the downside in my opinion. The 5 ema likes to act as support or resistance depending on the trend. Tomorrow everyone needs to be careful if you are bullish that we dont miss the top of the dead cat and if you are bearish that you dont let an over reaction of the market to meta give you false bias. \n\nNote- post is fluid as meta continues to change after market levels.\n\nQQQ:\nWe tested and held above the daily 200 ema of 363.5 (low of day was 364 though). This overall is bullish. \n\nwe currently are looking at a daily MACD buy signal. \n\nSupport to watch for tomorrow (updating this real time as im watching meta effect the market negatively). We need to stay above 363.4 which is the daily 200 EMA. However, we just dipped nearly 2% after hours and broke that like nothing. \n\nWhile we did break a major resistance yesterday today has some worrisome bearish signals we need to take seriously. Yesterday we very nearly avoided closing a bearish red hanging man candle but the power hour pump saved us. Today we closed the red bearish hanging man candle... this can be a signal of a reversal. We very well may continue to see downside tomorrow and the rest of the week. \n\nA key level to watch is the daily 5 ema of 361.3 this is the last support that keeps me believing we are short term bullish. Once that breaks i think its time to flip back to puts. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/gFC6fXQ.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/uDZigUO.jpeg\n\nOkay so wtf do we do tomorrow? \n\nWell a couple of things to keep in kind. \n\nAfter hour trading is lower volume and can be way more extreme. We should expect in the morning to give some of these losses back as people buy the dip. \n\nToday may be the inverse of what tomorrow brings. Id look for some sort of significant retest of those major supports (SPY 454 and QQQ 366). Look for the rejection to confirm this during market hours. I think a rejection may be your sign to be bearish.\n\nThe market was in a clear correction 2 weeks ago and was in my opinion saved by the tech earnings posted last week. Many of us had even said how looking at last friday it felt artificially run up and didnt make sense to not be dipping. \n\nDo not fight the trend. Let the chart tell you where its going. Dont over analyze or look for something thats not there. (Still working on this myself).\n\nAlso it appears some of that wild volatility we saw over the last weeks is gone. Entry points and exit points are more crucial now. If your trade goes against you it may not come back later in the day like we saw it do 2 weeks ago. Same if you get the right movement maybe its time to take profits early. Dont be greedy. \n\nAnd for my critics who will say dIdNt YoU jUsT sAy AtH? No i didnt.

Let’s get into it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wKazfWEo2kghgrBU0EjBFqVREhqGyhac-PsQV0LvuIw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wKazfWEo2kghgrBU0EjBFqVREhqGyhac-PsQV0LvuIw/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Growth stocks may get propped up or annihilated based on general market volatility.** If the entire market is dying yet, *&lt;insert growth stock here&gt;* reports a stellar earnings, it may still get dragged down. The same goes for the opposite. We saw that with a boatload of mega-caps last week. Since this week has lots of wonky growth stocks reporting, don’t put all of your eggs in one basket. This added volatility adds extra risk to ALL of our trades, whether you’re short or long, or buying or selling.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Do NOT bet against Lourenco Goncalves.** $CLF reports earnings on Friday, and I expect an insane quarter out of them. Analyst estimates are down, yet last quarter LG said that this quarter will be their strongest in history, leading me to believe that a beat is not priced in whatsoever. The expected numbers are actually WORSE than last quarter, yet the CEO literally told us this quarter will be better than last, setting us up for a surefire beat. To top it all off, there has been some pretty crazy insider buying going on over at $CLF, adding even more confidence to my trade. I know people roll their eyes at this, but around 10% of the entire float is shorted, which may further increase buying pressure on $CLF post earnings. Regardless of if you choose to trade it or not, make sure you don’t play the short side of this trade, as it’s a recipe for disaster.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$CHGG has some notable insider buying.** There has literally never been insider buying in the history of the company up until this month, where the CFO, CEO, and Director added to their positions handsomely. At first glance, I’m inclined to be bearish on Chegg because they singlehandedly ratted out a bunch of my friends in university, but the insiders think otherwise. $CHGG also puts up some pretty gnarly moves post earnings, so if you’re correct on this gamble, you could be looking at a clean 10 bagger. Similar to $CLF, regardless of how you decide to play this ticker, I would not want to be short.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you’re bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we’ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, the IV on $UBER will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. This was just a crude summary, and if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nStay safe out there everyone!

The CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food, is expected to rise 5.9 percent.

"For me, when the market is so fragile and tense, there is a higher possibility of positive surprises. The terrible decline in the market in January laid the foundation for the strong trend in February. The faster the decline, the faster the rebound."\n\nHe added that the growing pessimism of retail investors in recent weeks was actually a reverse signal that the stock market was about to rebound rapidly. Retail investors have raised a lot of cash, giving them ammunition to re-enter the market after they think the worst is over.\n\nIn addition, he also pointed out that the relative strength index has fallen to the lowest level since the sale in March 2020, indicating that investors have sold too much, are sending a "buy signal" and maintaining the target level of the S &amp; P 500 index at 5100 at the end of the year.

Goldman Sachs believes that the tightening of the US financial environment, the slowdown of economic growth and the flattening of the US bond yield curve may "depress" the return of the Russell 2000 index (representing small and medium-sized stocks) relative to the S &amp; P 500 index (representing large cap stocks).\n\nThe kostin index shows that the return rate of the past two years will continue to lag behind the kostin index in 2022. Citing Goldman\'s model, he pointed out that the small stock index could rise by 7% in the next 12 months, while the expected return of the S &amp; P 500 index at the end of the year was 14%.\n\nHowever, JPMorgan analyst Marko kolanovic suggested buying small cap stocks. The valuations of these stocks mean they are unlikely to bear, he said.\n\nIn addition, Julian Emanuel, strategist at evercore ISI, also pointed out that the trend of the Russell 2000 index also had an impact on the market.

The combined revenue of Microsoft and Activision are only in the middle teen of the whole gaming market including console, PC and the fragmental mobile gaming. \n3.

My guess is the delinquency rate has risen.\n\n-The Amazon partnership probably won't be as great as assumed.  Amazon earnings were ok, but the $20 rise in Prime membership made AMZN pump.

Everyone has a different risk tolerance. And everyone needs to do whats right for them and their families. Some may only be able to do 5% some 10% some 20%. \n4. I made it clear we never let the trade go red. But let me clarify that as there is some confusion. When you first enter you may initially be red momentarily. Its only to be down 5-10% for a few minutes. We may not always as much as we want to catch straight green. But what i meant by this is we never let a trade thats up 10, 20 or 30% finish red because we got so greedy and it turned fast on us. It happens unfortunately that we are right and made a great trade but there is an unexpected reversal. Have a stop loss. \n5. I mentioned a break even stop loss is better than red. Some didnt understand that. Yes being up 10% you probably should take profits and walk away. But if you really think its gonna go your way and really think its going to run. Set a breakeven stop loss and let it go. Of course if you were right and you get 15-20% up move that stop loss to 10%. This eliminates red days. \n6. This is a completely different approach than most people take which is why its getting so much flak. Most people who do options are 100% gambling. They see SPY had a red day and say yes man 10% OTM calls for tomorrow 0 dte for sure. Thats gambling not investing. We dont yolo.

Despite hurdles such as COVID, harsh weather, geopolitical uncertainty, and the chip crunch, the top ten most valuable companies in Asia supply chains managed to survive, and some even flourished, according to the findings.\n\nWith a cut-off date of December 31, 2021, DIGITIMES conducted rankings based on market capitalization data of listed firms engaged in manufacturing activities in Asia supply chains. Tech product/equipment, consumer electronics, semiconductors, electrical components, electronic components, automobile manufacturing, automotive components, and mechanical industries were among the top 100 firms.\n\n67 of the top 100 market cap corporations saw their market worth increase over the previous year, while 31 saw their market value decline.\n\nWith a market worth of $576.3 billion as of the last trading day of 2021, **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.

Despite the chip crisis that severely hit the global automobile sector, **Toyota Motor** came in third with a revenue of US$298.6 billion and managed to expand by 17.9%.\n\n**In comparison to last year, the top three corporations are in the same order.** The market\'s acknowledgment of TSMC\'s competitive edge, as well as the semiconductor industry\'s essential position in the aftermath of the US-China trade war and the COVID-19 epidemic, explains why the company has consistently ranked first in the market capitalization. "TSMC is unquestionably the world leader in advanced technology R&amp;D and production," said Eric Huang, vice president of DIGITIMES Asia and leader of the survey research team.\n\nTSMC\'s share price, on the other hand, had mostly consolidated in a relatively narrow range in 2021, with just a minor growth of 16 percent. Because TSMC\'s stock price increased by 60% in 2020, it\'s logical that the company would go through a phase of consolidation. Furthermore, demand for foundry services from advanced to mature processing nodes continues to be strong, with a long line of people waiting to be served.\n\n**It\'s also worth noting the structural shift in IC foundry demand.** TSMC and Samsung are the only two businesses in the world that can deliver advanced processing nodes (7 nm and down), as more companies build their own chips in-house or through fabless design companies for the best performance on their devices.\n\n"With a client portfolio that includes all of the major competitors in the CPU/GPU arena, including Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and MediaTek, as well as ASIC customers like Apple, TSMC\'s competitive edge, is undeniable," Huang added.\n\n**Samsung Electronics** portrayed a distinct story since it combined display, mobile devices, consumer electronics, and Harman (an American automobile entertainment system maker acquired by Samsung) with the semiconductor business.\n\nIn Q3 2021, Samsung\'s semiconductor division accounted for 35.7 percent of total sales and 63.5 percent of operating profits (Q4 data not available yet). Though its semiconductor sector grew by double digits in revenue and profits year over year, its market cap was dragged down by the poor development of other end product divisions.\n\nWhile the chip crisis has had a significant impact on most Asian manufacturers, Toyota was one of the few automakers to see its market capitalization climb by double digits. Due to foreign currency translation and a $2.3 billion stock buyback plan that is due in March 2022 to maintain its ROE above 10%, its share price increased by 32% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2021, but the market cap increased by 18% in US dollars.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Toyota was quick to straighten its supply chains and ramp up production to fulfill demand ahead of the other manufacturers during the pandemic\'s recovery. It predicted an operational profit of JPY 2.5 trillion (about US$22 billion) for the fiscal year ending in March 2022 in May 2021. Toyota\'s overall sales increased 36 percent year over year in the first half of FY2022 (6 months ended in September 2021), while operating profit exceeded JPY1.7 trillion\n\nToyota\'s announcement to invest $70 billion in 100% electric vehicle cars by December 2030 was warmly received by the market, in addition to its strong supply chain management capabilities. Although Toyota\'s ambition to make 1/3 of its car lineup all-electric by 2030 is more conservative than Volkwagen\'s 50%, Forbes senior writer said the market consensus appears to have acknowledged Toyota\'s strategy as a logical approach to the EV evolution.\n\n**CATL** (electrical component), **Sony** (consumer electronics), **Keyence** (tech product and equipment), **BYD** (automotive manufacturing), **Tokyo Electron** (semiconductor), **Midea** (consumer electronics), and **SK Hynix** (consumer electronics) were the companies with the fourth to tenth largest market values among Asian supply chain manufacturers (semiconductor).\n\nIn 2021, semiconductor equipment makers and electric vehicle/battery firms, especially battery and EV manufacturers, appeared to be the darlings of Asian capital markets. CATL and BYD\'s market caps increased by 72.1 percent and 44.2 percent, respectively. Tokyo Electron, one of the largest semiconductor equipment manufacturers, had a 55.1 percent surge in its stock price.\n\n[***Contributor: Investment Funda on westmoney***](https://www.westmoney.com/share/stocknewsdetail?lang=en&amp;id=935189610689073152&amp;color=2&amp;wm=reddit3)'), ('Going all in on a fb meta swing', 'Going all in on a fb meta swing[removed]'), ('Need suggestion on Meta options', 'Need suggestion on Meta options[removed]'), ("Facebook aka Meta, I don't like this stock", "Facebook aka Meta, I don't like this stockIn fact, I hate this stock.

Generate Trade Ideas using Seasonal Patterns', "What is the best time to buy and sell? Generate Trade Ideas using Seasonal PatternsTrying to bring back the detailed DDs that were here before everything exploded last year with growth. This is from a blog post I recently wrote.\n\nSeasonal patterns repeat themselves time and again in financial markets.  From many corrections taking place in Feb-March, to the end of year [Santa Clause Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus_rally),  retail traders can learn about them, and leverage historical data and  seasonality to generate alpha in the markets. For instance, going into  small caps [IWM](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=IWM)  at the start of October and staying in till end December every year has  yielded a profit of about 9% every year. Compare that with [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  where the average yearly profits are about 17%, despite the holding  period being 4 times more i.e 3 months compared to full year. These  types of statistics can help us come up with trade ideas, and that is  what we are going to discuss in this blog post.\n\n## Seasonality Data\n\nWe will start with more macro analysis and move towards analysis that is very granular and can  help us do a deep dive into seasonal data.\n\n## Month, Week, and Hour Seasonality\n\nWe are going to talk about the radar charts for months, weeks, and hours seasonality in [Stocks Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard). The figure below shows a summary of the charts for [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY).  Each corner is either a month, hour, or a week day, and the values are  the number of times price has closed green for each variable. More  specifically, at each point, we look at data from the last 20 years, and  calculate how many times the price closed green. For instance, the  value at August would be the percentage of how many times in the last 20  years [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)'s price closed higher than it opened in the month of August.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/onef1os30wg81.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=786373f3e3dd0d4477ff16b4389d26a1db6cd806\n\nWe can see that [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  seasonality starts to get better from July onwards and continues to  increase till the year end. This can inform us that trading [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  for bullish plays is best done during the last six months of the year.  On the other hand, we can see that the seasonality is quite even/bad at  the start of the year, which can actually prevent traders from going  heavy into bullish plays at the start of the year. Although this data is  useful, it is still not granular enough to give us specific plays.  Therefore, let's talk about a few more tools we have.\n\n## Granular Seasonality Across Time\n\nKnowing what's the best half of the year to buy a stock is good  information. But we can do better, and look at more granular information using our Seasonality &amp; Price Movements widget in [Stocks Dashboard](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY).  This tool shows the cumulative average daily, minute level, and hourly  change for the stock under analysis. At each analysis point, we observe  how much did the price change, and create a cumulative graph of that  change, averaged across time. The purple line demonstrates that while  the green and red lines are simply the upper and lower bounds of how  much price is expected to move at a maximum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqlwq4t40wg81.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55fdd2047230fc9cc85e8d308cd5f7880656bcf7\n\nThe chart above illustrates the granular seasonality of [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)  from 2010 to 2019. We skip 2020 because of the COVID crash, and want to  do testing in 2021. From the chart, we can observe a number of things.  First, the start of the year is a very choppy time period for the market  in general and stocks do not have a clear direction. From March  onwards, price starts to get in a bullish trend, but the trend is not  very strong. In around June-August period, there is on average a quick  mini-rally. Finally, after August, price starts to gradually continue  going up historically with a strong uptrend, leading to an end-of-year  Santa Rally. Those are quite a few observations, let us now see if they  actually worked in 2021 and 2022. We advise readers to do this analysis  on 2020 as well, because they will find very similar stats.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3c0eiug50wg81.png?width=2884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8a6285692caf0f2886414d168c2b0e0a1da002c\n\nHaving the knowledge from looking at the seasonality from 2010 to  2019, let us now see if that applies to future data as well. Analyzing  the last two years, we can observe very similar behavior in [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY).  Dips and choppy markets both happened in the start of 2021 and 2022,  which is not surprising given we had already observed that fact over the  historical data. Another great thing is the rally from June to August,  which netted about 7% in just three months in 2021. Finally, we can see  the big rally at the end of year, which we call the Santa Rally.  Overall, the price of the entire year looks very similar to the average  price of the last 10 years. That is a very strong edge for retail  traders because it lets them stay in and out of positions at the right  time, and somewhat time the market, which is an incredibly hard thing to  do without looking at any seasonality data.\n\n## Intraday Seasonality\n\nMost people look at seasonality based on days, weeks, or months of  years. However, there also exists seasonality in how the price of a  stock moves intraday, and retail traders can leverage that to great  effect. Let us take a look at [AMD](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=AMD)  and how it moves intraday. The first thing we need to do is pick the  minute level seasonality in the tool. The figure below shows that the  price of the stock, on average, goes down for the first half of the day  and goes up on the second half of the day. It is important to note that  this is averaged data across many months, and it will not work out  exactly every single day. Despite that, if we see a dip on the first  half of the day, we can somewhat assume that the stock can potentially  move up on the second half of the day.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dulp9fb60wg81.png?width=1450&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=366b30e1ac2002fa4274424fcd1289c9a4c6cf38\n\nLet us actually test this theory on minute level data for [AMD](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=AMD)  from Feb 1st to Feb 4th, 2022. The figure below demonstrates the  effectiveness of the intraday seasonality. Looking at the four days of  data, we can see that the stock generally tends to go down after the  market opens. There was only one day where it did go up for a while, but  by the mid day, the stock is either down or break even. Despite that,  it starts to go up in the later part of the market hours. It was only on  Feb 3rd, where it went down a bit towards the end. However, an accuracy  of 3/4 is quite good especially since we are simply looking at  seasonality without doing any additional analysis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3rjkx7170wg81.png?width=1370&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=805a284b25325c93d46625717e8229b737f10128\n\nAnalysis like this can help us find patterns that different stocks  follow, and make plays based on them. For instance, if you want to go  bullish on [AMD](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=AMD)  for a day trade, the second part of the day is where you should enter  into your position. For readers, we would urge you to take a look at [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY)'s intraday seasonality chart. You might have heard that [SPY](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=SPY) makes most of its move pre-market and after hours - you will see a proof of that.\n\n## Macro Comparisons\n\nSeasonality data also lets us analyze differences in how different  sectors or indices move across the year. The chart below shows a  comparison between [QQQ](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=QQQ) and [IWM](https://tradytics.com/stocks-dashboard?ticker=IWM).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfgb5bs70wg81.png?width=1550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26bdd281559e832bdaf90879bfdb6631c842128e\n\nLooking at the charts, there are some differences that catch the eye.  First, QQQ can often rally at the start of the year, but IWM rarely ever  goes up much at the start of the year. In contrast, IWM goes up  significantly more at the year end compared to QQQ. Although the  principle here is valid for all types of comparisons, if you look at the  data for IWM in 2021, you will see that we actually did not get any  rally at the end of year. This example is added deliberately to show you  some limitations of seasonality analysis. It only looks at historical  data, and if market regimes change, it can be invalid for future.  Therefore, please always do some additional due diligence on top of your  seasonality analysis.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nAs discussed in the last section, it is paramount that you do some  additional due diligence on top of your seasonality analysis. As long as  you're doing your due diligence, seasonality data can provide you great  insights and trade ideas, that can help you become a more profitable  trader. We hope this guide will prove useful to you and help you become a  better trader.

Let\'s once and for all answer the question: is Tesla overvalued, undervalued or ... fairly valued? \n\n# Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)\n\nLet\'s start with the *typical* bull thesis. The one you probably encountered thousands time in the wilderness of reddit or (trying not to vomit...) twitter. It goes like this:\n\n* Tesla will grow car production and sales by 50% annually for foreseeable future... Eventually, reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)\n* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021), because of 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even [Alien dreadnought](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-revives-his-alien-dreadnought-factory-dream-for-batteries-2020-9?op=1) will eventually happen?\n* Tesla is a *tech company*. They will make shit tons of money by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and even eventually launch their own marketplace (akin to AppStore).\n* Tesla is... [*ETF*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5-2xfZmwR0)*?*\n* Tesla sexbot. Enough said.\n\nLet\'s start with an automotive sales part:\n\n* Say Tesla is so Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). In Q4 2021 Tesla reported 15.653B of automotive sales without regulatory credits and 308.65K cars delivered, resulting in ASP of $50.7K. I know that automotive sales include other things as well, but it\'s good enough approximation. \n* Assume the prices will increase by an average of \\~3% annually due to inflation (in hopes that current inflation spike will subside). By end of 2030, **ASP of Tesla would be 50.7K x 1.03****^(9)** **= 66.2K**.\n* With **net margins of 13%** that would result in 66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = **$172B net income**. \n* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and will somewhat converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers (note, we are looking at automotive business now): Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla is Tesla, so we take an automotive **Tesla PE - 15**.\n* Tesla market cap in 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. That can\'t be right! An absolute leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD with outstanding operating margins (\\~twice the industry average) with PE also about twice the industry average will only triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3\'s)?\n* Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to NPV of 2.58 / (1.07^(9)) = **1.4T\\*,** so *... Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued?*  Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth (beating inflation by 4% in our example) instead of investing into SPY? \n* From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B) it will return you (2.58/0.89)^((1/9)) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.\n\nBut careful ~~Tesla stan~~ observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let\'s discuss what is wrong with the thesis above?\n\n# Chapter 2. Automotive market or "bulls are fukd".\n\nMany analyses that I read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply, arguing that the ramp up of the existing factories as well as the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching (bull) 20M by 2030. What they fail to address is TAM, which is the EV market in 2030. \n\nNo doubt the market will be enormous by 2030. In particular, EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/)), China plan to transition 100% to so-called "New Energy vehicles" (that include plug-in hybrids) by 2035 ([source](https://www.autonews.com/china/china-explores-ambitious-goal-ev-sales-2035)), and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/climate/biden-tailpipe-emissions-electric-vehicles.html)). In my opinion, it is logical to conclude that Plug-in Hybrids + BEVs are unlikely to capture 100% of World\'s automotive market, especially given that 30% of all cars are sold outside of EU, China and USA ([source](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/passenger-car-sales-by-key-region-2010-2020e), i.e. places like South America, Africa, CIS region, etc. where penetration of EVs should not be expected to be high even in 2030). So, even if we assume 90% penetration rate we are being overly optimistic and generous. \n\nAccording to [McKenzie](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/disruptive-trends-that-will-transform-the-auto-industry), we should expect around 2% annual growth of automotive volumes sales. From 2021\'s approx. 80-85M cars sold it leads to 95-101M cars to be sold in 2030. With 90% penetration rate the upper bound for all EV vehicles (plug-in hybrids + BEVs) is 90M cars (again, let me remind how obnoxiously bullish these assumptions are). \n\nThis is how EV sales look so far according to [EV-Volumes.com](https://EV-Volumes.com): \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dsy1udkmah81.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad813de026aa40b5acb772351d5a92bd368223bd\n\nIt\'s easy to estimate Tesla\'s market share from this graph:\n\n* 2018: 245K / 2082K = **11.8%**\n* 2019: 367K / 2276K = **16.2%**\n* 2020: 500K / 3240K = **15.4%**\n* 2021: 936K / 6750K = **13.9%**\n\nI don\'t want to raise an alarm or anything, but it looks like Tesla\'s market share peaked at 16.2% and already is starting to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe, to my taste, to make conclusions on the trend\\*. But is difficult not to make a connection between the loss of Tesla\'s market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy OEMs.\n\n*\\*Although I really enjoy observing how TSLA bulls update their trends based on one good month for example.* \n\nYou could argue on this point, but in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Think about the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. According to Elon himself target for Cybertruck is 250K annual production, so we are left with an already 10-year-old design Model S with some facelift and 5-year-old design Model 3. I consider Model X and Model Y being an SUV versions of S and 3 respectively with basically same designs (I am talking about aesthetics and not engineering aspects). We observed firsthand how this affected Model S/X sales:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2p8zuwtuah81.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12cd6fb1a72ef5fadd3890a7441f03c689174bd7\n\nwhereas the effect on Model 3/Y is yet to be seen.\n\nIt is not difficult to understand why. Unlike a smartphone or a smartwatch, if you buy a new car for $60K, you want to make damn sure people around are aware it\'s a new car for $60K and not 7-year old one for the price of $25K. (See I didn\'t have to touch upon quality or lagging ramp up of service center vs total produced cars over the last 5 years, etc.). \n\nAs the result, by taking an obnoxiously bullish estimate of 90M EV cars by 2030 along with (still IMO bullish) 13.9% of Tesla\'s market share results in 90 x 0.139 = **12.5M cars.** Which is 37.5% lower than 20M cars of the ultimate bull thesis. This as the result leads to **1.61T** valuation by end of 2030, or **6.8% percent annual growth** (it\'s a rookie number in this racket)**.** We already approaching the point where automotive sales alone (unlike what some of the TSLAnalysts want you to believe) cannot justify current valuation. \n\n# Chapter 3. "Get rich or die trying"\n\nThis is in fact a continuation of the previous chapter, but I figured it was already too long. Let\'s touch the second point from original bull estimate, which is ASP (average selling price). \n\nPerhaps for people who HODLed TSLA for more than 5 years, throwing a 50K at a car is no biggie. Fun fact, *TSLA* is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car *Tesla* ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz "announced" 100K order from *Tesla*, *TSLA* jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn\'t we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current TSLA hodlers? khm....  \n\nBack from philosophy, for many non-TSLA hodlers 50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 12.5M cars (for reference Toyota guided FY2022 (calendar 2021) sales of 8.25M cars), it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing models or introduce cheaper ones. *Especially* given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up. \n\nAccording to the latest [Toyota Financial report](https://global.toyota/pages/global_toyota/ir/financial-results/2022_3q_presentation_en.pdf), ASP for Toyota cars are 23.3T yen / 6.1M = 3.8M yen or 33K USD (in reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services). But Tesla is no Toyota, Tesla is better in every way imaginable. So let\'s assume that despite the pressures of the competition, Tesla manages to keep the current ASP for half of the sales (again bullish assumption). Whereas the other half will come from a cheap model. No one hopes for $25K anymore, give us at least $35K model Elon! So the ASP becomes: $50.7K x 0.5 + $35K x 0.5 = $43K, adjusted for inflation (x 1.03^(9)) - **$56K** or 15% lower than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K. \n\nSo the results so far, TSLA by end 2030 - **$1.37T** valuation, or **4.9%** annual return if you invest today. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in the models. \n\n**Margins.**\n\nOne topic I will not really touch is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand things like Gigacasting or structural batteries might or might not help to increase margins. But drawback of the latter is much lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties cost. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD. \n\n**My own biased opinion on the numbers.** \n\nI claimed that the numbers we used above are rather bullish. If I am tob make a guess on EV penetration (PHEV + BEV), Tesla\'s market share and ASP, my decision would fall on the following:\n\n* PHEV + BEV penetration - 75% (still rather bullish IMHO)\n* Tesla market share - 10% (same, rather bullish)\n* ASP - 38K x 1.03^(9) = 50K,\n\nPlugging in the numbers (with the same margins) we obtain: 75M x 0.1 (market share) x 50K x 0.13 (net margins) x 15 (PE) = **$731B valuation by end 2030**. If I wanted a 10% annual return from a single stock (vs. 7% of SPY), I would pay no more than $310B or **276 USD per share now.** \n\nBefore you say it\'s outrageous:\n\n1. We looked only at car sales business\n2. Note how this model still results in TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW. And all that due to the high expectations of growth alone. High growth is a blessing, but the **expectation of high growth over the long timeframe is a risk.**\n\nHowever, when we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting investors to hell: \n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.macrotrends.net\\/stocks\\/charts\\/TSLA\\/tesla\\/shares-outstanding](https://preview.redd.it/t3yw2cnp9bh81.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63d04547b1b708369151452e47282f6067d3a5f9)\n\nGiven the expected growth (ramp ups of existing ~~factories,~~ sorry Gigafactories) as well as introduction of new models, etc. will definitely result in more fund raising (i.e. forget about any buybacks before 2030 for sure). \n\nOn top of that Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to receive crazy stock compensations, he is open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares as it increases the supply side of things (and I am too smooth brained and by now drunk to discuss it now). \n\n# Chapter other product lines of Tesla:\n\nAs for the other product lines, it\'s difficult to judge now as they are in their very infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity:  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bl00qqaxbbh81.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3fcf7ea30f814816348dcfbec1badd914b133cf\n\nSince 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing so far:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anc8ocxccbh81.png?width=1664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87b5e4e97704058c04a638dfdad605fe9230a184\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ed30zlqcbh81.png?width=1678&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cbb15884ecfb227650c40de2872229e89b3690d\n\nIt\'s often not clear how a company calculates gross margin, but losing money on the gross margin (in contrast to operating margin) is actually a very bad sign. It means that the cost of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla is spending $100 to buy solar tiles and another $50 for shipping, and $200 for a labor to install it, and sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include (depends on the company) general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc.\n\nThe TAM by itself is very arguable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/10-biggest-solar-companies-5077655)) have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla\'s valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business. \n\n# Chapter Hype: Fraud Self Driving:\n\nThis one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.* \n\nSince Tesla doesn\'t share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the  prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers. \n\nAfter your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Again, if you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry starting all the way from Darpa\'s challenges and even before. \n\nBut if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short distance. Elon straightforward lies when he claims that Tesla is in the phase of marching nines. They would often obfuscate it with Beta release notes such as "Recall rate for pedestrian detection increased by X%" (Often times you can already derive that they are not in the marching nine phase). And all of the quantitative release notes are only related to the sensing part of the system, i.e. nothing about decision making. How good their decision making is getting? The reason is that the planning side of things are still hard-coded by engineers and they apparently have no way of quantifying the progress on the equally important part of the system. But I promised no engineering discussion. \n\nIn comparison, in 2020 Waymo\'s disengagement rate was at 1 per 11000 miles, which is the order of magnitude difference. Before you argue that Waymo is geofenced and the Tesla is not, you should realize that the latter practically doesn\'t work at all. \n\nBack to numbers, in average US driver drove 14000miles in 2019 ([source](https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/average-miles-driven-per-year/)). Now let\'s say that not all FSD disengagements are that bad (like are you f\\*\\*king kidding me right now?), and most of them wouldn\'t result in dangerous situation. Let\'s say 90%. Fuck it - 99%. That is still 1 disengagement per \n\n# Chapter History.\n\nFolks at one particular subreddit love to compare Tesla to Enron. IMO the comparison is weak. What I personally like to compare Tesla to is *Cisco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was *the stonk* in 2000. Unlike Tesla though (at least so far), Cisco actually was the **World\'s biggest** company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. To understand it, 2000 were so long ago (hard to believe) that the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/)), SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today\'s dollars (side note, Microsoft and Apple being both above 2T hint at the level of consolidation not seen for a very long time, if ever).\n\nAnd yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1999-09-13/cisco-could-be-the-safest-net-play-around) claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2000/03/20/story2.html) Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years (again, we are talking year 2000 here). At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?\n\nIn the chart above you see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven\'t recovered to it\'s ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -22%. And the thing is, unlike Enron, Cisco is the real solid company with current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. It\'s just it was too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.\n\nIt doesn\'t really matter whether Tesla is 5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth? Whether or not it is a good investment (or bet).\n\n# Chapter WSB. How to lose money on this\n\nWell, I am no financial advisor, so go long, go short, you do you. Personally, I am shorting. However, it is not without a risk. Tomorrow Tesla announces start of Cybertruck production (or Roadster) and stock will start mooning because... reasons? As if Cybertruck or Roadster are not priced in. \n\nMy post is a bit late (actually I started writing in November 2020 but had to postpone due to important deadlines at work), but my preferred strategy for Bears would be:\n\n* Start accumulating OTM put leaps. Choose strike as to adjust your total delta according to your [personal risk tolerance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d80ahvRSV8E). Better yet, if you can afford to lose your total premium.\n* Choose DTE as to not worry about theta for at least half a year (interest rate increase? market correction?), i.e. expiry for a year out.\n* I know it\'s not a WSB style, but you don\'t have to wait for puts to get ITM (even if they do you might still lose when all said an done). Just offload the bags back onto market makers during the next huge volatile price dump (again, overall market correction?)\n* You could hedge with calls at times of strong momentum (like October run up from 800 to 1200), or when you see that it is in the short term oversold (RSI &lt; 20ish).\n\nIMO if there is a better time to short, it\'s probably now at the prices around 900-1000 (or earlier at 1200). Then again, so thought all the shorters when Tesla reached 500...\n\n**For Bulls: HODL or something...

I’m going to try to keep this shorter than it should be by keeping this post mostly focused on VIAC as a short term earnings play, but this stock is also an incredible pure long play as well. DD for long term investors is linked at the bottom of this post. \n\nA few numbers and charts might be slightly outdated (by a week maximum). I started working on this DD last week, so a bit of my data is old!\n\nVIAC Current Valuation- \n\nViacomCBS as of market close on February 9 is currently valued at a 23.30B market cap, 7.02 P/E, and 9.14 forward P/E, and At this valuation, the company screams value trap. Forward PE is currently being dragged down by Q4 2021 EPS estimates, but I will discuss that later in this post. VIAC is a dying company in a stagnant industry with 0 revenue growth and a limited future? Wrong. \n\nFirst, let’s look at their topline. VIAC’s 2020 revenue was 25.03B, while their TTM 2021 revenue is 26.81B. Additionally, their current average 2022 revenue estimate is 29.29B. Low revenue growth, but certainly not a dying company deserving a P/E ratio of 7.\n\nNow, let’s look at the valuation of peers in the streaming industry below. The chart is a little bit outdated, but the numbers are approximately still the same. All streaming companies generally trade at a forward P/E generally greater than 20, excluding DISCA, which is trading at lower valuations relative to its peers due to its unfavorable merger/acquisition terms with AT&amp;T’s WarnerMedia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzsv858shqh81.png?width=1230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebb5dfa0e72127d25614362863a10affc205aee6\n\nThere are no similar hurdles in the upcoming future for ViacomCBS. **The market is simply completely discounting ViacomCBS’ streaming arm and its current progress.** Cable TV accounts for around 45% of VIAC’s current revenue, and because CableTV provides 12-13B in revenue annually, cord-cutting concerns are a major point of worry for investors, company’s executives and overall company long term health. VIAC’s executives, however, clearly recognized these concerns, which is why they acquired PlutoTV in 2019 for $340 million and launched their own streaming platform in March 2021. \n\nSince its release in March of 2021, Paramount+ has already driven Viacom to accumulate 47.4 million subscribers- 4.3m in Q3 and 6.5m in Q2 of 2021 alone. In addition, PlutoTV generated over $1B in ad revenue in 2021 and has surpassed 55m monthly active users- an incredible investment by ViacomCBS. In 2020, PlutoTV had 33m MAU’s and 450m annual revenue. Its growth in the past year is astounding.\n\nPlutoTV namely, along with Roku, and Tubi are currently the leading cable killers. Although VIAC is losing cable customers and their revenue, it’s gaining them right back through PlutoTV. \n\nCurrent Outlook\n\nIn 2021, this stock has been completely shafted by the implosion of Bill Hwang’s fund, general bearish sentiment toward VIAC, and tax-loss harvesting. However, the stock found a bottom in late December 2021 and has been slowly climbing its way back up in 2022. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lif64y6thqh81.png?width=2286&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44bc15daa5591282f041446449811f262d60a42a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x98s4hlthqh81.png?width=2294&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f06d3f694e4f2d14992aee6f5aad7f673aae733a\n\nAn incredible earnings report with absolutely blowout streaming numbers could initiate a large rally to at least $40 for this stock- likely way higher. The most likely scenario for said rally would be initiated by the market finally gaining faith in Viacom as a legitimate streaming company. If VIAC’s next earnings report sufficiently blows expectations out of the water, this company might finally see a much-deserved streaming valuation. Even a price/earnings ratio of 15 would see VIAC doubling from its current valuation. A 10 million subscriber quarter would be a great start- and this is exactly what we’ll be seeing. \n\nVIAC will double if it’s valued at a genuine streaming company. On February 15, VIAC will be announcing Q4 earnings, announcing full 2021 financial results, and hosting an investor event providing an update on Paramount’s momentum and the company’s content and IP . **A quarter with an increase of 10 million new subscribers and a well laid out plan by VIAC executives on the future for Paramount+ would finally give VIAC the credibility it needs as a legitimate streaming play.** Luckily for us, we can use Google trend data, cyclical industry trends, and look at updates from VIAC executives, which we can use to estimate subscriber growth and next quarter’s bottom line. \n\nFirst, we can look for Paramount+ Google Trends activity.  Starting from Q4, there is a massive spike in Google user interest in Paramount+. In Q2 of 2021, Paramount+ added 6.5m subscribers, while in Q3, they added 4.3m. Based on past Google Trend activity, we are set to see a massive increase in subscribers in Q4. However, we need to dig deeper. Why has activity spiked?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8qpv0euhqh81.png?width=2316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42a3acdc7502f361f357010c8eec79348844c319\n\n**T-Mobile partners with ViacomCBS.** \n\n[In early November of 2021, T-Mobile partnered with Paramount+. They now offer a free year of Paramount+ to all customers with either cellular or internet plans. ](https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/paramount-plus-deal)\n\n[In that same week, Paramount announced that they added one million new subscribers. ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2021/11/17/clifford-helps-paramount-add-1-million-new-subs-in-a-week/?sh=5616310e3fbd)\n\nYou know what people enjoy? Free stuff. T-Mobile has a lot of customers- over 100 million of them. Let’s say 50% of those subscribers have cellular or internet plans. 5% of cellular or internet customers redeem their free Paramount+ membership last quarter. That’s 2.5m subscribers alone. This estimation is generously underestimated, but you should get the idea. This partnership with T-Mobile should not be underestimated. \n\nBased on Q3 and Q2 numbers, we can estimate that base subscriber gain (without the positive catalysts I will be discussing- like the T-mobile partnership) would’ve been approximately 5 million. Let’s add 2.5 million subscribers from T-Mobile's partnership. We are already at 7.5 million subscribers in Q4. \n\n**Football**\n\nNext, we can look at football. Q4 of VIAC’s fiscal year overlaps with NFL regular season, so we can expect a large boost in viewership from the NFL season ramping up into full swing. But that isn’t all. This year’s NFL season was incredible. \n\nIn the 2021 regular season, NFL viewership saw an increase of almost 10% in ratings from those in 2020, and a 6-year record in viewership at 17.1million. [CBS saw a nine per cent increase for its regular season games, posting a 21.59 million average audience across its ten national game windows](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/nfl-tv-ratings-2021-regular-season-viewership/). Guess who streamed the most viewed game of the regular season? That’s right. CBS. [The Dallas Cowboys featured in five of the 2021 regular season’s ten most watched games. This included the Thanksgiving matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders on CBS, which became the most-watched NFL regular season game on any network in 31 years, drawing in 40.8 million viewers. This was only the second regular season game to eclipse the 40 million mark since 1988.](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/nfl-tv-ratings-2021-regular-season-viewership/) And guess where CBS NFL games are available? That’s right. Paramount+. \n\nBut the NFL is just part of the story. CBS has the streaming rights for the SEC. Viewership last season was record breaking, and for the championship game last season it [peaked at almost 18m](https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/cbs-reveals-huge-ratings-numbers-for-sec-championship-game/) viewers. It wasn’t just the championship game though- viewership for the SEC was at an all time high,[ especially on CBS. ](https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2021/11/sec-ratings-cbs-most-watched-game-week/) And obviously, a portion of these viewers signing up for the game to be streamed on Paramount+. Google trend data is available below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5zgealvhqh81.png?width=2310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf40bef5bf9898b6efdb54a67e142516cac358c6\n\nSince Paramount+ was released in March of 2021, until Q4, it has barely seen any growth from true, regular season football. Let’s estimate that NFL and SEC streaming contributed to a 1 million subscriber gain for Paramount+. Q4’s net subscription gain is already at 8.5 million. \n\n**New Shows- Yellowstone and Kingstown**\n\nIn Q4, Paramount+ also had two new shows, 1883, and Kingstown, which both debuted on Paramount+, the former of which drew record viewers. [Supporting the company’s claim for 1883‘s big debut on Paramount+ over the first 24 hours of release is the delivery of the premiere’s airing behind Yellowstone on Paramount Network. The promotional linear telecast drew strong 4.9 million total viewers in Live+Same Day, according to Nielsen, making it the biggest new series premiere on cable since 2015 (AMC’s Into the Badlands, which followed juggernaut The Walking Dead at the height of its ratings supremacy).](https://deadline.com/2021/12/1883-yellowstone-prequel-paramount-plus-premiere-record-ratings-paramount-network-viewership-1234900017/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img 4r1mw9gwhqh81...*\n\n[For comparison, another new Taylor Sheridan drama series for Paramount+, The Mayor Of Kingstown, logged 2.6 million viewers for the special airing behind Yellowstone (7.5 million) on Paramount+ for a 35% retention. (Into the Badlands premiere’s TWD lead-in retention was 50%).](https://deadline.com/2021/12/1883-yellowstone-prequel-paramount-plus-premiere-record-ratings-paramount-network-viewership-1234900017/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whyabelxhqh81.png?width=2418&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a496fbd5683998cf731fce25901a9cd2afa62bb5\n\nQ4 of every fiscal year always sees a massive increase in subscriber growth. For reference, Disney added 11.8 million subs in its most recent quarterly earnings report last week, yet in the quarter before, it had only added 2 million subs. Netflix sees a similar effect (its quarterly subscriber growth chart is available near the bottom of this post). Netflix gained 4.4 million subscribers in Q3 of 2021, and 8.3 million in Q4. I’m not totally sure why there is always such a massive spike in subscriber growth in the last quarter of every year, but I will attribute this cyclical effect to Christmas gift-giving and other holiday boosts. \n\nLet’s make another conservative estimation and say that Kingstown, Yellowstone, and cyclical seasonal factors gives Paramount+ a 1.5 million subscriber addition. We are not set for a 10 million subscriber growth quarter for just Paramount+. Awesome\n\n**November Update-** \n\nViacomCBS’s Bob Bakish also [updated us in November on Paramount’s growth](https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2454570376257/viacomcbs-ceo-streaming-revenue-crosses-5b-annual-run-rate). In the current fourth quarter, total streaming revenue is crossing an annual run rate of $5 billion, Bakish shared, adding: “We are getting somewhere significant pretty quickly.” ViacomCBS said in February that it expects to grow its streaming revenue to $7 billion by 2024, up from a then-current run rate of $3.6 billion.\n\nWhat’s this mean? 20% streaming revenue growth QoQ at the very minimum. Streaming revenue in Q3 of 2021 was 1.08B. At 5B ARR, we are looking at 1.25B streaming revenue in Q4. With the current pipeline of content that is coming to Paramount+ (Halo Movie, Scream, Sonic 2, etc.), I wouldn’t be surprised if VIAC is able to achieve $9-10B streaming revenue by the end of 2024. CableTV is responsible for around $12-13B revenue, based on VIAC’s current declining CableTV revenues, it’ll still be providing at least $10B revenue in 2024. VIAC will continue to see top-line growth for the next 5 years. \n\n**EPS**\n\nNow, let’s talk about EPS estimates for Q4. The EPS estimate for Q4 is at an all time low of 0.45. First of all, that’s fucking ridiculous, and VIAC was definitely going to beat estimates regardless of any special factors. Wall street analysts are suddenly expecting the bottom line to decrease by 40% just because they would be investing more into streaming? That’s ridiculous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g7635j42iqh81.png?width=1274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d19b7a44a4be102e3de82377a16fdab5b0218234\n\nIn the last 5 years, VIAC has never had a single quarter where its reported EPS was below 0.75. 0.45 EPS is ridiculous. \n\nHowever, VIAC is guaranteed to smash this 0.45 EPS estimate out of the park. How do I know this? Last November, they announced their [Studio City Lot](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-11-30/viacom-sells-cbs-studio-radford-lot-hackman) in LA for 1.85B, and the deal was expected to close by the year’s end. With how ridiculously inflated LA real estate is these days, we can definitely expect that the proceeds were significantly above book value. What does this mean? Net income for Q4 will be significantly higher than expected, especially with analyst estimates already so low. In the last 3 months, the EPS estimate for VIAC has only constantly been brought further and further down.\n\nQ3 Guidance: [Total company revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $6.6 billion. Adjusted OIBDA fell three percent to one billion as we continue to ramp up programming and production spend coming out of COVID and increase our investment in streaming. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.76. Adjusted free cash flow was a use of $187 million in the quarter, reflecting a ramp in programming spend, including our investment in streaming. Adjusted free cash flow in Q4 should reflect a continuation of this trend.](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/04/viacomcbs-inc-viac-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcrip/)\n\nLess FCF. Certainly. A 40% drop? Unwarranted. 0.60 EPS is far more reasonable. \n\nLet’s make a small estimate for EPS if we factor the Studio City Lot. The Studio City Lot was sold for $1.85B and auctioned off to the highest bidder. **As of September 30, 2021, VIAC had an estimated $1.809B worth of property and equipment on its balance sheet. Let’s estimate that The Studio City Lot had a book value of $1B - likely far higher than it should be. If we disregard taxes, the land sale will result in an $850 million dollar boost in earnings in Q4. Based on VIAC’s outstanding shares (between 600-650 million), we can estimate that this one-time land sale will cause an EPS boost of $1.31/share, disregarding taxes. That’s 3x higher than current EPS estimates, and that’s disregarding VIAC’s true bottom line. EPS will be a blowout. Amazon mooned on an EPS blowout thanks to their Rivian gains. I think we see a similar effect here.** \n\n**VIAC literally sold their Studio City Lot for $50 million higher than the book value of all of their property and equipment listed on their Q3 balance sheet.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Estimated EPS Next 12 Months](https://preview.redd.it/y0bv1ro6iqh81.png?width=1768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c95aecdd2af711b3168b90b5dc97fe3cec40278c)\n\n[ViacomCBS Q3 2021 Balance Sheet- Total Property and Equipment Valued at 1.809B ](https://preview.redd.it/yobnq679iqh81.png?width=1226&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59e0777403d60235d574795354429080222f7aec)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Licensing and Possible Acquisition**\n\nThe most powerful players in the streaming wars are Netflix, Disney(+Hulu &amp; ESPN), Amazon, and HBO &amp; Discovery once they merge. A quarter of **ALL** Amazon, Peacock, and Netflix content is licensed from VIAC. \n\n[ViacomCBS Content Licensed to Other Streaming Platforms](https://preview.redd.it/pkuo7vjdiqh81.png?width=1376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8676712fc4993d640dca5157c54e45e75e3455cf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe streaming wars are just beginning, and in this industry, content is king. And guess who owns a veritable mountain of IP? ViacomCBS. As Disney and HBO take back content rights from rivals to improve their own streaming libraries, Viacom’s own licensed IP becomes more valuable and even more important when it comes to strengthening content selection and variety. Their leverage has grown ever stronger at the negotiations table when it comes to licensing content to other providers and it will continue to improve in the next few years. We can expect even higher content licensing revenue to continuously increase in the future. \n\n[“Content licensing is an important business but … our strategy is clearly evolving, particularly with Paramount+,” Bakish said. The company has a library of 4,000 films, 140,000 TV episodes and current production of 150 series globally. “We can’t keep all that for ourselves. It doesn’t make sense. It’s too much,” he said.](https://deadline.com/2020/11/viacomcbs-ceo-bob-bakish-on-licensing-content-we-cant-keep-all-that-for-ourselves-the-upfront-production-ramp-1234610307/)\n\nAlthough Bob has stated otherwise last year, the threat of VIAC pulling a Disney/Warnermedia hangs over Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix like a dangling sword. VIAC could decide to go all in on its streaming platform, pull its content from its rival platforms, and go all-in on Paramount+. This would be a massive hit for VIAC’s revenue and earnings, but the threat remains. This threat, however, is what makes VIAC so valuable if acquired by Netflix, Amazon, or even Apple (lol).\n\nAn acquisition by Netflix or Amazon would allow it to pull VIAC’s content from the other platform, dealing a massive blow to a competitor. The acquiring company would gain an enormous library of content, streaming rights (CBS NFL rights are incredibly valuable), and Paramount Studios, whose recent movies include Jackass Forever, Scream, Clifford the Big Red Dog (lol), Sonic the HedgeHog, The Tomorrow War, and A Quiet Place. \n\nThe most recent quarterly earnings reports of both Disney and Netflix have shown deep, systematic problems with Netflix. It’s losing the streaming war. In Q4, Disney added 11.8 million subscribers, allowing it to accumulate 200 million subscribers across Hulu, ESPN, and Disney+. In the same quarter, Netflix added only 8.3m subscribers, which missed its guidance of 8.5 million subscribers. Netflix has a total of 222 million subscribers, up less than 10% YoY compared to Disney’s. Disney+ on the other hand, grew 37% YoY. Netflix’s growth is slowing, while Disney’s is also accelerating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Netflix Subscriber Growth in the Last 5 Years- Decelerating](https://preview.redd.it/dycynchhiqh81.png?width=1310&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aafdc19596af8d8da882119f73f8c121b405c770)\n\nNetflix does not have the IP or the firepower to compete against Disney, and in the long run, they will lose the streaming wars. In order to continue its growth, Netflix must acquire VIAC. An all-stock transaction similar to AMD-XLNX (an arbitrage play I made in the last 6 months!) might be the best path for Netflix.\n\nDisney acquired 21st Century Fox for $71.3B (One of the Big 6- Paramount, Walt Disney, Universal, Sony, 21st Century Fox, and Warner Bros)\n\nAmazon acquired MGM Studios for $8.45B\n\nDiscovery acquired WarnerMedia for $45B\n\nIt is unlikely Redstone would sell VIAC, but in the event that she does, based on past acquisition prices, the buyout price for ViacomCBS would easily be in the $60-100B+ Billion range. At minimum, we’d see 2.5x upside from current prices. VIAC’s current 23B market cap is ridiculously undervalued. \n\n**PlutoTV**\n\nIn the last twelve months, PlutoTV has seen an annual growth rate of 100% YoY in both revenue and subscribers. That’s absolutely ridiculous. At over 1B annual revenue as of Q3 2021, if valued as a separate public entity, it’d easily be valued at 5-10B market cap alone. \n\n**Streaming Arm**\n\nVIAC has accumulated 50m subscribers across its streaming platforms. Netflix has 220 million subscribers. At a 175B market cap, if we applied the same subscriber valuation multiple from Netflix, VIAC’s streaming arm would be worth $40B. At half the subscriber valuation multiple, VIAC’s streaming arm would be worth $20B. This would be disregarding PlutoTV, content licensing, Cable TV, and all of VIAC’s most profitable cash-flow generating assets. \n\n**Positions**\\- Approximately 5-6k in weekly and monthly calls. \n\n200 shares.\n\n10-15k in $25 2022 September, $30 Jan 23, and $45 2023 and 2024 LEAPS. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mzdd0tjiqh81.png?width=2182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dcbfab410b06ac070fc453b8d40298b184615e1b\n\n**What Could Go Wrong? Hedging**\n\nThe biggest risk for VIAC FD’s would be macro effects. The market will likely sell-off ahead of FOMC minutes release on Wednesday and will dump hard with a genuine Russian invasion of Ukraine. Personally have hedged with a combination of 5% OTM SPY and 10% OTM TQQQ puts. SQQQ calls or QQQ puts would also work. Option premiums are priced for a very large move next week, but puts will still print hard if Russia invades Ukraine. Although VIAC went up 7% last week even with Ukrainian fears and inflation issues, it will 100% dump if SPY drops 10%. This kind of earnings play needs a hedge due to current macro factors. \n\n**VIAC Pure Long DD**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyx6tx/viac\\_god\\_tier\\_way\\_too\\_long\\_dd\\_all\\_aboard\\_the\\_p/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyx6tx/viac_god_tier_way_too_long_dd_all_aboard_the_p/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r9sd8r/the\\_viacomcbs\\_viac\\_saga\\_part\\_iii\\_return\\_of\\_hwang/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r9sd8r/the_viacomcbs_viac_saga_part_iii_return_of_hwang/)\n\nSeeking Alpha has some pretty good DD on VIAC, too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: VIAC is valued as a dying company even though their topline will likely see at least 10% annual growth for the next two years. They’re going to post a net +10 million subscribers quarter, blow out EPS estimates, announce that they're to fully concentrate on streaming growth, and finally, attain a streaming company's valuation. Earnings and a streaming investor event are on Tuesday. Buy short-dated calls on VIAC and hedge with puts on broad market ETFs in case of market-wide issues. I expect at least a 10% move upwards from current share prices at the minimum. \n\nDisclaimer- I'm a college kid who trades options for fun."), ('Please let the NFLX to fly!', 'Please let the NFLX to fly![removed]'), ('How much will SPY move in Monday 02/14  ', 'How much will SPY move in Monday 02/14  \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/srxgwz)'), ('How do people lose money on earnings play?', 'How do people lose money on earnings play?I just saw a post saying it’s stupid to buy calls before earnings because of IV crush. This earnings season I made 17k profit off of 4k invested from a GOOGL $2840 2/11 call and a CMG $1550 2/25 call.\n\nIf you’re losing money on earnings play where you know a company will beat earnings, you’re seriously impatient and don’t know how to play high volatile market plays. Both of these calls I made sure had relatively low IV, the google call had an IV of around 40% and the CMG call had an IV of 60% (Ik this is relatively high but for earnings it’s actually pretty low). \n\nThe key to my strategy which has worked super well is having excellent timing with your options for earnings. The google call was bought at 3:55 pm and the chipotle call was bought at 3:45 pm. Why? My philosophy is I want to minimize the other Greeks impact on options prices so I can capture as much gains from the high change in delta from after hours movement. By buying right before market close the day that they report earnings, I’m reducing the risk of time volatility (theta) impacting my calls or puts before the after hours movement. I always sell my calls the day after earnings report release at 9:30, regardless of gain or loss. This is because IV crush will always come the day after earnings, but if you sell at 9:30, IV is still high enough that you can capture most of the gains from the delta increase.\n\nIf you buy your calls/puts during the day of earnings planning to swing trade them after the after hours movement, you’re seriously retarded. You’re just letting your option lose value throughout the day, cause let’s be honest for earnings you want to buy week out or two week out options, due to theta. Sure, you can scalp a little extra profit if you buy at the low for the day, but it’s not worth the risk.\n\nI swear if you follow this strategy of buying a two week out ATM or slightly OTM call at 3:55 and sell at 9:30, you can’t lose unless you pick the wrong direction.\n\nThe whole point of earnings is to capture the AH gains that change your option price enough that delta offsets the decrease in vega. By trading only for about 5 mins of market hours, you’re limiting theta’s effect on decreasing the gains from delta. I honestly don’t get how you retards can lose following this strategy. Shit I’ve made a third of my salary following this strategy.\n\nTLDR: buy your options for earnings ATM or slightly OTM with a week or two for expiry and sell at 9:30 the next gain to always win if you get the right direction.\n\nDon’t believe me? Buy Nvidia calls with 2 weeks expiry at 3:55 and sell at 9:30 and I guarantee you at least 50% gains.\n\n[proof](https://ibb.co/2tx13wc)'), ('$TSLA bullish price is 287USD (DD)', '$TSLA bullish price is 287USD (DD)[removed]'), ('Stonk market’s over af.

The fed president spoke on CNBC around 830a and essentially said a whole lot of nothing but did say inflation was worse than expected. Markets than began their sell offs. We seemed to had established a pretty clear and cut downward trend making lower lows from around 945 am to 1115a. Then the market got its first bit of wild reaction to news.

The only people who don’t know that are the team at Reddit, who can’t be bothered to build a decent search interface. So instead we resort to using Google, and appending the word “reddit” to the end of our queries.\n\nPaul Graham thinks this image means Reddit as a social media site “still hasn’t peaked”. What it actually means is that the amount of people using Reddit as a search engine is growing.\n\n📷\n\nWhy are people searching Reddit specifically? The short answer is that Google search results are clearly dying. The long answer is that most of the web has become too inauthentic to trust.\n\n## How do we know Google is dying?\n\nIf you’ve tried to search for a recipe or product review recently, I don’t need to tell you that Google search results have gone to shit. You would have already noticed that the first few non-ad results are SEO optimized sites filled with affiliate links and ads.\n\nGoogle still gives decent results for many other categories, especially when it comes to factual information. You might think that Google results are pretty good for you, and you have no idea what I’m talking about.\n\nWhat you don’t realize is that you’ve been self-censoring yourself from searching most of the things you would have wanted to search. You already know subconsciously that Google isn’t going to return a good result.\n\nI’m far from the only one who thinks Google is dying:\n\n[Daniel Gross](https://dcgross.com/a-new-google)\n\n&gt;In 2000, Google got popular because hackers realized it was better than Lycos or Excite. This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren’t using Google anymore.\n\n[Ask HN: Has Google search become quantitatively worse?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29392702)\n\n&gt;The results keep getting "refined" so as to suit the popular 80% of queries, while getting much worse for any technical or obscure queries. Forced synonyms and "people also searched for" are typically useless and almost infuriating. Once you get off the first or second page, the results get even worse-- with pages entirely unrelated to the query (e.g. not even containing the searched phrases). They are probably testing/already implemented some sort of multi armed bandit type optimization like on Youtube\'s search results where they just show any popular pages (ignoring relevancy) to see if they yield a click.\n\n[Michael Seibel](https://twitter.com/mwseibel/status/1477701120319361026):\n\n&gt;A recent small medical issue has highlighted how much someone needs to disrupt Google Search. Google is no longer producing high quality search results in a significant number of important categories.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Health, product reviews, recipes are three categories I searched today where top results featured clickbait sites riddled with crappy ads. I’m sure there are many more.\n\n[Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1477760548787920901)\n\n&gt;This may not just be a problem with Google but possibly also the recipe for beating Google. A startup usually has to start with a niche market. Why not try writing a search engine specifically for some category dominated by SEO spam?\n\n## Why is Google dying?\n\n### Ads\n\nIt is obvious that serving ads creates misaligned incentives for search engines. The founders of Google pointed this out themselves when they were just getting started.\n\n[Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page (1998)](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html)\n\n&gt;“Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users…we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers…Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.”\n\nUnfortunately, these thoughts on the failings of ad-based search engines read like an instruction manual for what Google did next.\n\nThey’ve dialed it up to the max recently to squeeze out every last cent before their inevitable collapse.\n\n📷\n\n### SEO\n\nThere are tons of people whose sole job is to game their way to the top of Google, so it shouldn’t be surprising when search results deteriorate in quality. To be fair, this would probably be an issue with any search engine, but you’d expect Google to be able to come up with a less gameable algorithm.\n\nHere’s a [fun story](https://alexskra.com/blog/the-mermaid-is-taking-over-google-search-in-norway/) about how one website gamed their way to the top of Google in Norway.\n\n### AI\n\nGoogle increasingly does not give you the results for what you typed in. It tries to be “smart” and figure out what you “really meant”, in addition to personalizing things for you. If you really meant exactly what you typed, then all bets are off.\n\nEven the exact match query operator (“ ”) [doesn’t give exact matches anymore](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27052634), which is quite bizarre.\n\n## Why are people appending “reddit” to their queries?\n\nThere’s a fun conspiracy theory that popped up recently called the [Dead Internet Theory](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/). The claim is basically that most of the internet is bots. There aren’t real people here anymore.\n\n[IlluminatiPirate](https://forum.agoraroad.com/index.php?threads/dead-internet-theory-most-of-the-internet-is-fake.3011/):\n\n&gt;TLDR: Large proportions of the supposedly human-produced content on the internet are actually generated by artificial intelligence networks in conjunction with paid secret media influencers in order to manufacture consumers for an increasing range of newly-normalised cultural products.\n\nThis isn’t true (yet), but it reflects some general sense that the authentic web is gone. The SEO marketers gaming their way to the top of every Google search result might as well be robots. Everything is commercialized. Someone’s always trying to sell you something. Whether they’re a bot or human, they are decidedly fake.\n\nSo how can we regain authenticity? What if you want to know what a genuine real life human being thinks about the latest Lenovo laptop?\n\nYou append “reddit" to your query (or hacker news, or stack overflow, or some other community you trust).\n\nGoogle is dead.\n\nLong live Google + “site:reddit.com”.\n\n*If you are interested in more thoughts and ideas on search and organizing information, you may want to follow me on twitter* [*@dkb868*](https://twitter.com/dkb868)*.*\n\n## Appendix 1: response from Google.\n\n### Google claims the exact matching feature is merely unintuitive, not broken\n\n[Danny Sullivan](https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/1493702054673485826):\n\n&gt;I work for Google Search, passed your feedback along, thanks. You said in the post that quotes don\'t give exact matches. They really do. Honest. Put a word or phrase in quotes, that\'s what we\'ll match. If anyone has an example where they feel it doesn\'t, please let me know...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Here\'s why people often think quoting with Google doesn\'t work when it really does (I\'ve looked a huge number of these reports).  \nWe match ALT text  \nWe match text not readily visible, such as in a menu or small text  \nPage has changed since we indexed it  \nPunctuation...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Punctuation comes into play if you did a quoted search like "dog cat" and there\'s text that says "dog, cat" then we\'ll see that without the punctuation. That doesn\'t seem a major issue but we\'re looking at if we could improve there.\n\n### And Google seems to be right so far\n\nEvery example of exact matching not working so far can be traced back to issues with punctuation, alt text, etc.\n\nFor example, one proposed [failing query](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30355528) was "quotes don\'t give". But HN user [saalweachter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30356152) has pointed out that it is a very intricate punctuation problem.\n\n&gt;For instances, on the \\["quotes don\'t give"\\] example, the first result I get is https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/never-give-up  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If I do a find-in-page for "quotes don\'t give", I get zero results. Oh no! Perfidy!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;... but, if you look more closely, you\'ll find this string waaaaay down at the bottom:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;tags: don-t-give-up, don-t-give-up-on-your-dreams, don-t-give-up-on-yourself, don-t-give-up-quotes, don-t-give-up-the-fight, encouragement, ...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thanks to the wonders of tokenization, that "don-t-give-up-quotes, don-t-give-up-the-fight" gives you the string of tokens, "don t give up quotes don t give up the fight", which contains the exact phrase "quotes don t give", which is the tokenization of the phrase "quotes don\'t give".\n\n## Appendix 2: Google just had record profits, you are obviously wrong, and Google isn\'t dying.\n\nI never said that Google wasn\'t making money. In fact, if Google really is squeezing every last cent out of ads without regard to search quality, I would expect their revenue to be at an all time high.\n\nI am saying that the quality of search results are declining. This may eventually lead to a decrease in revenue, but has not yet.\n\n## Apendix 3: Seriously, what are you talking about? My search results are perfect.\n\nIf you think your search results are perfect (without appending reddit), then you\'re probably right. If every single person agreed that Google search results were trash, then Google would already be bankrupt.\n\nPerhaps it is more likely that 80% of people think Google is good enough, and 20% think Google sucks.\n\nI do suspect that the 20% will be growing in number though.\n\n## Appendix 4: *Yawn*, this is the 87th time someone has claimed that Google search is dying in the last 20 years. This is a big meme in the SEO world.\n\n*"The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated" - Google, probably*\n\nYou\'re right, there\'s been a new article bashing Google every few months for the last 20 years straight. It\'s probably nothing.\n\nStill, it is a bit interesting that this short and simple post is now one of the most upvoted things of all time on Hacker News. There must be a lot of people who resonate with it this time around.\n\nHard to tell if something significant has changed.\n\n## Appendix 5: Random redditor explains it succinctly\n\n[u/a\\_latvian\\_potato](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/st9ri1/comment/hx3zubc/):\n\n&gt;I think I understand what this article is trying to say. It\'s not saying that Google\'s search technology is worse or that people don\'t use Google to search. It\'s saying that people trust less of the results Google shows compared to seeing discussions of it on Reddit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For instance, if I\'m looking to see reviews of the Honda Civic 2022 or whatever, I actually do find myself typing "Honda Civic review reddit" instead of "Honda Civic review". This is because I want to see what real people and enthusiasts (on r/cars or whatever) are talking about the car, rather than the top results at Google which are basically just paid reviews advertising the car anyway.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even though I kinda know people in Reddit are just as capable of spouting BS that are completely wrong, I find the discussions more authentic anyway than the corporate speak the "big websites" have on their articles that Google shows me.\n\nSauce: [https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying](https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying)'), ("How do the masses of $TSLA 🌈🐻's on this sub find boyfriends for their wives?", "How do the masses of $TSLA 🌈🐻's on this sub find boyfriends for their wives?[removed]"), ("I'm sitting on 60k of NVDA and AMD stock that dipped quite hard, thoughts?", "I'm sitting on 60k of NVDA and AMD stock that dipped quite hard, thoughts?So 60k presently but I bought close to the top of the pump last november. First was 40k, then did another 40k on the way down fortunately. But had no idea it would go back so low. These are stocks that basically got manipulated +50% and then returned to baseline.\n\nI think I am going to sell once they cross my dollar cost average. I am then going to put most of it into a more stable megacap like GOOG MSFT AMZN. Then if it crashes again, I will re-enter with a smaller, more reasonable amount.\n\nI calculated that this overall has/will cost me like $100 in SEC fees but that means nothing to me if I can stop seeing this bullshit pump and dumps in my portfolio.

After posturing over 100,000 troops along the Ukrainian border, AP reported that his military has started to pull back some of its forces. So is diplomacy in play?  \nWhile my analysis may be wrong so far, I did get one aspect correct. Putin was at a standstill and had to make a move, or risk diminishing his bargaining power. I thought Putin would take the opportunity to use aggression and force Zelensky’s hand to ultimately reject NATO. He used it to open negotiations on his terms.  \nI recognize that no one wants to go to war. They are expensive and often lead to unintended consequences. But Putin’s posturing shift seems to signal something else. If diplomacy is on the table, why not start with that? It could have been a miscalculation, with Putin assuming the Ukrainian comedian would quickly submit. But at the end of the day, Russia wants Ukraine independent from NATO and Ukraine wants to remain in NATO. Both of these realities cannot be true. Putin has to either admit defeat in negotiations, or invade Ukraine.  \nNegotiations will begin quickly, if they occur. So we will know if Putin plans to keep his word within the next few days. I’m guessing we’ll hear about a false flag attack in Belarus.

Today was no exception. Today we saw yet another trend reversal by the feds. Today was saw red most of the day, though it broke one major support at 443.1 and essentially filled the gap minus a about $0.25... for me thats considered a filled gap. \n\n2pm brought the release of the fed minutes from last month. Markets seemed to have been bracing for hawkish news however, apparently they digested it as doveish (mostly neutral/ no unexpected news) and the markets saw a 180 recovery. We turned a -0.7% day into a positive day within minutes. However, as quick as we saw the turn around the one thing i did notice was that we QUICKLY loss buyer momentum. Watching the candles and volume ticker move in real time once we high out first major resistance at the notorious 446 range i noticed we very quickly lost momentum and from there we struggled. \n\nThe biggest back and forth tug of war came at the 447 mark. pretty much the whole last hour it was nothing but back and forth. This shows me that despite the "good news" catalyst the market ran with there is still far more selling pressure compared to buying pressure. Eventually we started to break down right as market was closing for a hardly bullish but still green 0.11% finish at 446.1. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxgbde2a2ai81.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c80cfed28b226270d66ad5af8a2f30fcf1ff03d\n\nThe nice thing about the last 3 days it has given us a TON of support and resistance lines to watch for future movement. There is no doubt SPY is unpredictable but I am starting to see a few scenarios I think we see play out tomorrow and even into next week. Heres what i am seeing....\n\nOn the Daily we did finally see a close above the 8 EMA of 446.16 (barely) however, we failed to break or even reach the 20 EMA (next major resistance line) at 448.73. To me the face that this "good news" catalyst wasnt enough momentum to turn a mild red day into a very red day is a big concern. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hj0se97e2ai81.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cdcf986a7c1a9b4ad26505a47c1f589be343024\n\nLooking intraday I aslo notice volume (especially intraday) appears to be very low. Up until the fed minutes we saw even less volume than yesterday (based off the graph... someone can comment with the true numbers i dont have in front of me). \n\nSo heres where I think we could be going tomorrow and what would make a lot of sense and a few potential plays...\n\nIf you look at the daily chart (ignore all the vertical lines i had that different time frames do that to it.... those are actually horizontal support and resistance lines). But i want to point out the black dotted line. That line is the downward resistance line that started in beginning of January and eventually saw us dip to 420. That line is sitting right around 454 right now. \n\nScenario 1-\n\nWe see another green run up tomorrow to test that resistance line. Would be about a 1.65% run which is very well within range of a normal spy. For this scenario we would see a rejection a hard rejection. This rejection would confirm we are still in a dip/ bearish short term market. We would then finish here with a hanging man candle (most likely scenario) and the following day (friday) would see a massive sell off falling back down to the 447 range first and then continuing downward. Eventually down near 420 for an official retest (I still personally favor a full on retest of this area).\n\nScenario 2-\n\nMuch like scenario 1 we see a 1.65% green day where we test the 454 resistance area. BUT this time we break the resistance line. NOW with this scenario we would HAVE to break 458. If we fail to break 458 we will see a MASSIVE daily chart triple top... I do not need to tell you just how bearish and bad that would be. It is not out of possibility to do it tomorrow but a retest tomorrow of 458 would be 2.5%. However, it is absolutely unlikely in this current extremely low volume and flat market that we see that. Now if the volume magically returns tomorrow well its possible. But again we need to avoid a hanging man candle here and triple top... This scenario would also potentially play out over two days. \n\n\\-obviously if we did triple top at 458 we all know that would be a beyond bearish scenario. \n\nScenario 3-\n\nSeeing the intraday chart, especially during power hour, we saw all the buying momentum fade. Its arguable had we not had the fed minutes today we could have had a very very red sell off... and especially if the news had been even remotely hawkish we would have seen a very very red day (near 2% if we assume the same movement it did bullish but inverse). \n\n\\-There is very real possibility that tomorrow we start yet another sell off. Like i mentioned above we failed to break the daily 20 EMA of 448.73. If we see a porlonged dip back below the daily 8 EMA of 446.19 we very well could start to see another sell off. \n\nSupports\n\n446.2 --&gt; 445.8 --&gt; 445.4 --&gt; 444.8 --&gt; 443.6 --&gt; 442.7 --&gt; 442.3 --&gt; 441.7 (a major support that bulls need to hold) --&gt; 439.7 --&gt; 437\n\nResistance-\n\n447 (major resistance) --&gt; 448.1 --&gt; 451 --&gt; 454.4 (major downward resistance from january) --&gt; 455.5 --&gt; 458 (needs to be broken to prevent triple top)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me I will be looking for a longer term PUT play (Probably at least 14-30 DTE) IF we see a confirmed rejection of 454. If we break through 454 I will wait to see the test of 458. IF 458 is broke I will absolulely be getting some 14-30 DTE calls as there really would be nothing bearish to hold us back until March when they do their first rate hike and have another FOMC meeting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay story time because I will always be honest with you guys about my investments and my P/L.\n\nMany of you who follow me know I was traveling for work today but still was trading. This morning my plan was if we broke 443.1 to grab puts for the gap fill down to 440 area. Well unfortunately i was talking to my girlfriend and missed my entry. In my fustration (first mistake) and rush (2nd mistake) I quickly attempted to jump into a 2/18 442 PUT (we were near 442.8 i think when i did this)... Then to my astonishment i was VERY confused when when we kept dipping to the why my PUT was going red. At first I thought I got a bad fill or something. But then we bounced hard off that 442.3 area and I all of a sudden was in the green again... it then hit me... I MADE A BIG MISTAKE... In my fustration and rush i bought a fricken CALL instead of a put. I nearly shit myself at first. \n\nHowever, due to my late entry (and pretty much completely ignoring my own strategy cause i was too distracted) I realized i actually had a salvagable play. I was up 5% at one moment and i was very convinced I was going to sell and just take the W and be okay with my mistake.\n\nI then started to get my head outta my butt and actually look to see what i was seeing. It seemed the gap was going to fill as much as it wanted to and we were reversing. Through a VERY long and stressful day I held my call. never going down more than 15% (did around 1230 when the russia cyberattack news came out). To me that candle seemed sus and an outlier based on the actual trend so i held and it recovered. My stop loss was set at 20% the whole time... \n\nNow comes the really sketchy part but at this point I had accepted my mistake and was taking it to the fed meeting (I can handle a 20% loss for the potential of a gain here since i have had a great week....). So on my drive there is about a 45 minute stretch where i have no phone service and it just so happens that the 45 minutes brought me right to the fed minutes dropping at 2pm. I hit the service finally right at 2pm to see the massive dip (still had my 20% stop loss so i was safe) and then i saw it flip (like always first reaction is wrong) and it start going to the races. \n\nHeld it all the way to 447 and watched that fight for a solid hour. Finally during power hour when it dipped back below the 447 mark i took profits. Managed to get a wild 43% gainer on a complete honest 100% dumb luck mistake. I am not by any means a lucky person but this is the luckiest this that has every happened to me ever. \n\nThis did teach me a great lesson though. Double check orders no matter how rushed I am, and to always feel confident in the trend and if you miss the entry wait for the next one. This very well could have been a very very very red mistake. And it definitely gut checked me. But i wanted to share this with you as its a mistake any of us could make.

As in if mondays candle is red we finish below and if its green we finish above that opening... It was merely a fun fact but we are not at 6 of 6... what does that mean? Absolutely nothing just some fun fact for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g1mktox3doi81.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfd48cee529f3ec7b5af11dcfeae69870f671534\n\nGoing into today many people due to the massive 2.2% sell off yesterday were screaming we were going to see a super green day. And up until probably 8am they sure seemed to be correct. Then we saw the sell pressure and retest of supports. Early morning we saw a quick pump and rejection at resistance 458.6 before we started our downtrend. Much like yesterday once the candles fell below the 8 ema we stayed locked in there pretty much all day. We reached an intraday low of 432.18. We had broken through the 432.2 support and arguably were preparing to push much lower right as the market was saved by Russia "news." Apparently someone stated that Ukraine was in peace talks and would not be going to war (more on this later). I personally think this was some straight up BS as SPY was once again for the 3rd time this week "saved" by a random news drop (one time was FOMC minutes) to prevent a massively red day. \n\nWe saw an actually incredibly bullish pop and a bullish set up for almost two hours. We then rejected perfectly at the 437.3 resistance line and upper bollinger. Of course another sell off came. With OPEX today i wasnt quite sure what to expect last 15 minutes but overall uneventful. \n\nAfter market Biden (an hour late mind you) spoke and stated that there is an Imminent threat and that he was confident Russia would invade Ukraine this week or in the next few days... Which is why I say that news around 1pm was BS. Just like the news on tuesday where they withdrew tanks... and then JK they didnt withdrawl tanks... while i am not one to scream manipulation as I only play intraday so i dont really care... but "they" know how sensitive this market is to "good" news right now and I do believe they are capitalizing on that to prevent this from massively being red everyday. \n\nNote- After market has dropped significantly red after Biden annouced the impending invasion. If that does not happen before tuesday market could react bullishly... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umbz3bw6doi81.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01e5d8e7b4bc71a757791d4cecd7fab04dee711f\n\nLooking at the daily chart it is fairly obvious what kind of trend we are in. Note the upper most dashed black line... That is the line in the sand for bullish vs bearish times. We failed with a great opportunity this week to even retest it. I am almost 100% confident that this week we will be retesting the lows of 420. And very possibly heading much lower. \n\nAs i mentioned two days ago when we closed below the daily 200 EMA that is and still is a bearish omen as we have failed to breach that 200 EMA today and traded much lower again. we just closed a FULL daily candle completely below the daily 200 ema... we didnt even accomplish that in the first sell off in January. \n\nMy gut tells me this is going to sell off until middle of march when Feds finally do their first rate hike and market digests that. I have been saying this since January that i believe our ultimate bottom will be near 380-390. \n\nI am just gonna give some macro supports/ resistance as a lot is going to happen before market open tuesday morning (remember no market monday!). I will try to do a more detail pre market post like i did today to my profile before i go to sleep tuesday morning. \n\nMajor supports- 432.19 --&gt; 427.45 --&gt; 420.75 \n\nMajor Resistance- 437.28 --&gt; 444.13 --&gt; 448 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% Challenge weekly update- \n\nThis week was one of my better weeks. I made 11 trades and 7 of those i closed for profit. Of the 11 trades i made i averaged 31% per trade. I started my week with 10K and finished the week at 29k for approximately 290% weekly profit on only 11 trades and averaging 31%/ trade. \n\nGoal for the week was 60% weekly profit for $6k. \n\nI know alot of people are skeptical on this 10% challenge but over time these smaller gains really do add up. it is crazy how a bunch of small consistent gains over time quickly add up to a very large return. We dont need to get rich in one day. We just need to make small gains. Remember there is 250 trading days/ year. If you want to make an average income of lets say $100k.... Thats ONLY $400/ day..... Thats 10% of $4k/ day used to trade. or 4% of 10k used day to trade.... IF you look at this analytically and fight the greed monster the rewards are amazing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recently changed to a margin account and a few people asked me why as i am a HUGE promoter of the cash only account. So as you know if you are below 25k in a margin account you can not day trade and you can only make 2 day trades in 5 days... However with a CASH ONLY account you can trade as much as you want with settled funds. So for those who are starting small like 1k or 5k or 10k you can use your FULL settled amount of cash every day. So you start with 10k make $500 profit the next day when market opens you have your fully settled CASH of 10,500 to trade. Its great because you can enter and exit everyday and you can do 10 $1,000 trades and are not bound by PDT rules. \n\nSo why would i switch to margin? good question. With a margin account as long as your STARTING balance at 930am is ABOVE 25k you can trade freely all day. So say you have 30k in that account you can trade all day long with that 30k as much as you want and do not have to wait for the funds to settle over night. so you could trade 15k 10 times realistically if you wanted to (obviously not advised) but you get the point. Note- profits do not settle till next day. ITs obviously recommended to have a cushion as if your 930am STARTING balance is less than 25k you are bounce by the 2 round trip (open/ close) positions in 5 day period. \n\nSo the reason I made the switch now that my options account is above 25k is because it gives me freedom. With a cash only account i knew in the back of my mind that i was making 1 trade and that was it. It really messed with me sometimes and i knew i was pushing trades too far and holding too long and missing out on gains because i knew i had to optimize that one trade. Often times too i would want to play the inverse of whatever position i had but couldnt. SO if i play the trend right and made a great profit on the dip i would like to play the receovery bounce but obviously cant. Also if you end up red on a trade you are just done for the day which also can be disheartening but does make you more patient too. \n\nSo i switched to margin to alleviate the pressure i was putting on myself. With margin i can make 2, 3 or 4 smaller profit trades of like 10-15% in one day and not be stressing as much. I also will not be as hesitant to take profits at say 2-5% if a trade goes against me as i know i can get right back in if i need to. IF i make a bad entry or like today with the russia news drop catch a bad media day i can quickly sell and make up for my loss on the reversal. \n\nHope everyone enjoys their 3 day week and i will see you guys on tuesday morning!'), ('More bad Press for Meta', 'More bad Press for Meta'), ('(Stock Market) The market has truly been in critical condition lately but can we talk about $TSLA puts for tomorrow - 2/18/22 PUTS', '(Stock Market) The market has truly been in critical condition lately but can we talk about $TSLA puts for tomorrow - 2/18/22 PUTS[removed]'), ('Direxion files for leveraged, inverse, inverse leveraged single-stock ETFs on FAANG, Nvidia, Tesla', "Direxion files for leveraged, inverse, inverse leveraged single-stock ETFs on FAANG, Nvidia, TeslaDirexion, *the ETF provider behind JNUG*™, is back with a vengeance.\n\nGet ready boys and girls because Direxion files for single stock ETFs including -1x, -2x, and 2x ETFs on\n\nAAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META (Facebook's new stock ticker), MSFT, NFLX, NVDA, TSLA\n\nNow people can pretend like they're bullish on whatever S&amp;P 5 stock that they think is going down when they're actually holding the short version.

No great engineers want to work for a leader preaching vision from his hot tub. \n\nThey had first mover advantage in cloud but now there are bunch of small and big players catching up with innovative &amp; reliable web services since cloud is not rocket science. \n\nThey are doing well in online shopping but margins are not great because it’s less tech and more labor management &amp; customer service, which can’t scale as fast as pure labor free well written non rushed software (Google search, Microsoft office products, gmail, YouTube, Maps, etc)\n\nAlso majority of online shopping is third party marketplace who are always scared of cheap knock offs driven by fake reviews and Amazon basics so I don’t think growth there is sustainable. \n\nFacebook:\n\nJust set of dying apps. We all know that no one really spends that much time on Facebook, Instagram, messenger &amp; whatsapp. They might have daily active users but those daily active users don’t really spend more than few mins on the app. Most of the communities and groups in these social media apps are ghost towns. They don’t rally own any mobile or desktop platform.\n\nAll the talk about meta verse is just the talks. It’s basically multi player real time game with VR which is not very new. Games (MetaVerse) can do well but it can also easily be very boring.\n\nNetflix:\n\nYet another streaming app with all content being more than 30 mins. Even if they come up with great content, No one really has attention span of more than 10 mins these days. Netflix also hasn’t even developed a proper search engine in these many years. I watch more content on YouTube and TikTok than all streaming apps combined. No wonder YouTube revenue is similar to Netflix.\n\nWhat’s the common problem with Amazon, Facebook and Netflix?\n\nThey are all tech companies with fear based culture. Engineers are always on their toes cutting corners to meet deadlines for next quarter so they don’t get fired in next performance cycle. So they never take long term risk or invest in big bets because big failure is not an option. Because they cut corners they also accumulate technical debt over time so basically talented engineers eventually spend more time keeping the lights on rather than innovating on new projects. \n\nFacebook and Netflix hire the top most tech talent and they have no rule rule. But none of their engineers ever came up with disruptive new tech and they are still basically a streaming app after so many years. Facebook similarly had to acquire innovations (Instagram, WhatsApp) because their engineers are too scared to get fired to innovate. \n\nI am also not long on Nvidia, AMD and all other companies whose products are not diversified.\n\nWhy am I long only ATM?\nBRB'), ('Show Me The Flaw In This Perfect Strategy', 'Show Me The Flaw In This Perfect StrategyAlright, my dealy regarded.

The Fed has finally inversed themselves and are wanting to raise interest rates.  \n2. Ukraine crisis\n\nOptions Plan:  \nWait for Ukraine crisis to play out to see if Russia does in fact invade or if they truly back off. As soon as the news breaks out, wait for stocks to start bouncing.\n\nIf stocks continue to go down after the invasion, wait for the Fed to announce that they won't be raising interest rates as quickly as before because they won't need to because of the war. \n\nIf you don't think stocks will rally, and if stocks continue heading down, you should wait until the Fed reverses their decision to increase rates and instead starts pumping the money printer again. \n\nAs soon as one of those things happens, find a tech stock that has dropped significantly over the past few months from its peak. Make sure it's a high conviction stock that has an extremely low chance of going bankrupt.  \n\n\nFor example, Robinhood, Meta, Square, Paypal, Docusign, Viacom, etc. Stuff that the industry NEEDS going forward. \n\nFor example, Square is unlikely to fail because they cover both cash transactions AND they're getting into coins as well. A lot of people use the cash app.\n\nAnother example, Meta or Facebook is extremely unlikely to go bankrupt because so many people use FaceBook, Whatsapp, Instagram, etc. Plus, if the metaverse succeeds, they'll skyrocket.\n\n  \nFinal step of the plan: Once the Ukraine Crisis outcome is confirmed, either invasion or whatever else..  \nWait until you start seeing stocks bounce a bit and then buy the furthest out expiration date call option (3 years out) at a Breakeven price about halfway between the current price and the peak.  \n\n\nFor example, $FB peak was $378. The current price is $206. Set the breakeven price to around $292, which would currently be the $265 1/19/2024 call. \n\nThen, simply leave it for 3 years until expiration or whenever you're happy with the profit. If stocks go lower over the next few months after purchase, you still have over 2 years to recover.\n\nIn the 2018 taper tantrum crash, it only took a year for QQQ to come back to the 2018 peak.  \nIn the COVID crash, it only took 6 months. \n\nThe only way you can lose is if we enter a massive recession or depression, and at that point, the couple of thousand bucks you spent on these options won't matter anymore since cash won't really matter anymore.\n\nFor example, the 2000 Dot Com bubble took 15 years to recover. That's the worst case scenario, but I think that's a very special case that doesn't apply anymore since tech is established and we can't live without it.\n\nThoughts?\n\nCurrent position: SPY $443 Put 2/28 waiting for Ukraine outcome.")], '2022-02-21': [('Small Yolo On NVDA before earnings', 'Small Yolo On NVDA before earnings[removed]'), ('100 $SPY calls at $455 expiring Tuesday.

[Putin Approval rating](https://www.statista.com/statistics/896181/putin-approval-rating-russia/) while not at an all time low, is still low.

China backing them gives them even more comfort as China will trade in tendies instead of dollars if given the option. \n\nThe last piece is current economy of the USA and Europe. Sanctions on gas are going to hurt the EU big time, everyone has over inflated economies recovering from a pandemic. No one wants to risk it over Ukraine. Everything above is well known by the US too so they will be reacting appropriately, how they will do that is beyond my scope. At the end of the day, Russia will have to use the dollar somewhere somehow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this very clearly points towards Russia invading and getting what they want, as they have been preparing for a long time for it.

I'm not suggesting anyone buy any at this time; and I don't currently hold any myself. This is a 5-10 year play; and if you're looking for somewhere to park some money over that time period I am predicting 500-1000% gains in that time period. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Bear's Thesis:** \n\n* A. They are a dying company used exclusively by boomers\n* B. Changes to data collection policies by Apple and Google handicaps revenue\n* C. The Metaverse is a poorly thought out attempt to pivot business strategies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disputing these thoughts; and why I'm Bullish**\n\n1. **Available user data does not reflect that Facebook is dying; or that it's user base is primarily boomers.** As of October of 2021, Facebook had **2.9 billion monthly active users** (\\~36% of the world's population) -- over the 13 quarters prior; Facebook has ALWAYS posted growth. \n\n* Analyzing that user base; \n   * 66% of those users login every day, \n   * **Median age of users is 31** \n   * **\\~60% of users are between the age of 13-34.**\n* Analyzing traffic\n   * Facebook is the 3rd most visited Website on the internet (behind Google and Youtube)\n   * 11.2B visits per day by 1.5B unique visitors\n      * The next most visited Social Media site is Instagram (which is FB) at 2.9B and Twitter at 2.4B visits. **Facebook gets \\~5x the visits by about \\~2x the unique visitors.**\n   * \\~22 minutes average time per visit\n   * \\~6 pages per visit \n   * **THIS TRAFFIC DATA DOES NOT REFLECT MOBILE APP VISITS, JUST BROWSER VISITS**\n\n2. The fact that Facebook gets 11.2B visits a day by 1.5B unique visitors means that while Apple/Google cutting off mobile data collection may have some impact on FB's revenue; **they still can obtain an enormous amount of data from browser access**. \n\n3. In 2022 the Metaverse is an outlandish concept that most of us (myself included) can see absolutely no value or utility in. Up to now VR has been a novelty with little application outside of video games and porn. It isn't wrong to be skeptical of this. **BUT** as of now Meta is way out in front on building an all encompassing virtual reality platform; and has cemented themselves as **THE** leader/gateway for anyone looking to develop a virtual reality product. If you need any confirmation bias that there is potential for value; Google which companies are investing in/working on/becoming a part of the Metaverse. **Facebook's Metaverse has a high probability to be for VR what iOS and Android have been for smartphones.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for why I believe Meta will see 500-1000% gains over the next 5-10 years:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe iPhone began development in 2004, was released in 2007, and reached most popular status in \\~2011. In that time Apple's stock price (adjusted for splits and approximated for an annual value) was \\~$.48, $5.40, and $12.10 respectively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow comparing that to the intended timeline of Zuck's Metaverse: Development began in 2021/22. The development timeline that I typically see for release of a product resembling a genuine VR worldscape is \\~5 years. We'll call it 2027. Zuck is predicting 1 billion MAU on the Metaverse by 2031. If we apply the same price movement that Apple achieved with the iPhone; Facebook's current price \\~$210 rises to \\~$2,400 in 2027, and reaches \\~$5,300 by 2031. I appreciate that comparing those price movements is an extremely non-scientific method for prediction and that there was a lot of other shit going on with Apple in that timeframe; so I've applied a 50% reduction to those increases for the sake of conservativeness and we're still left with a share price of **\\~$2,150 in 2031.**   \n\n\nTLDR:   \nFB is still growing and primarily used by young people\n\nFB has more than enough browser based traffic to keep its data supply without Apple/Google's cooperation\n\nVR is a realistic/legitimate growth industry ; and FB has positioned themselves to create the iOS/Android that the rest of VR is run on. \n\nPrice target is $2000 by the end of 2031.

This is a very useful indicator as you can analyze the movements of the markets based on the normal distribution curve.  In normal distribution 68% percent of the data will occur within one standard deviation from the mean, 95% of the data within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% of the data within 3 standard deviations.  Over a large enough sample size the probability of the price of $SPY being further than 3 standard deviations away from the mean is less than 0.3%.  When markets opened Thursday morning the price was below the last bollinger band which happens very rarely.  Many high frequency trading algorithms noticed this and started buying like crazy causing a chain reaction which explains the market rallying Thursday and Friday.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions I played last week since positions are required in DD posts now:\n\n[Bought Thursday in after hours, sold Friday around 11:50am](https://preview.redd.it/8daxdhm2i7k81.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a72d545fe296e0a980a5ba9d7ceec7478242aedc)\n\n[Bought Wednesday throughout the morning, sold at the top around 3pm](https://preview.redd.it/46hrvgm2i7k81.jpg?width=1010&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7103f65f9ac4dc326fdf0b5f6846dbd7cbbddc33)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**----------This week----------**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/cqukbyisj7k81.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0100a7672ab1057d355ff1de49bff552fbda480)\n\nA new trend pattern has been formed in the markets with a diamond top.

Reddit often doesn’t like financial links so I have not referenced these. The DD is written in my own words from scratch, but infers a lot of information from these sources. I will link any direct quotes. If you require any of these sources for your own research, please PM me and I’ll dig through my history.*\n\n**This DD was written on too much Adderall.**\n\n***I’ve decided to include the TL;DR of the TL;DR’s at the top, as a lot of you don’t like to read, please find this straight after the ‘What is Marvell?’ section.***\n\n**What is Marvell?**\n\n* It develops, designs and sells analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, and embedded and standalone integrated circuits. \n* It offers a portfolio of Ethernet solutions; including controllers, network adapters, physical transceivers and switches. As well as single or multi core processors, application specific integrated circuits, printer SoC products and application processors.\n* The company provides a range of storage controllers for HHDs and SSDs that support various host system interfaces such as SAS, SATa, PCIe, NVMe. As well as fiber channel products, including host bus adapters and controllers for server and storage system connectivity.\nIt is essentially a data infrastructure semiconductor solutions provider. It’s storage and networking products cater for data centre, carrier/5G and automotive applications. \n\n&gt; Here is what Carillon Tower Advisers has to say about Marvell Technology Group Ltd. in its Q4 2021 investor letter:\n\n&gt; "Marvell Technology provides infrastructure semiconductor solutions. Investors have recently appreciated the particularly strong growth the company has posted, as it is winning designs in the datacenter server market as well as winning notable contracts in the upcoming 5G wireless infrastructure build-outs. Supply chain issues had hampered growth in 2021 for the company, but with some improvements there recently, we believe Marvell is set to exhibit robust growth in the upcoming year."\n\n**General TL;DR/TL;DR of the section TL;DR’s:**\n\n* Marvel acquired Inphi in April 2021, a strong company in electro-optics, serving hyperscale cloud providers. The deal is expected to drive long-term incremental growth by 5% on avg through 2025. Inphi could account for 30% of Marvell’s revenue by 2025. Dr. Ford Tamer (Inphi’s president/CEO) joins the board of directors at Marvell. \n* Marvell has acquired Innovium for $1.1 billion in, which had a 29% market share in Q4 2020. The deal allows Marvell to obtain a more substantial portfolio to face the future in networking. Marvell now can compete more broadly against competitors (Broadcom, Intel, Texas Instruments, and Microchip). Marvell now has stronger momentum with hyperscalers and cloud service providers. The Innovium CTO/Founder Puneet Agarwall, with 20 years of experience, has joined Marvell as an advisor. This deal strengthens Marvell’s cloud data centre game and position in the Ethernet switch semi market. It also secures Innoviums channels in the merchant cloud semi switching market. \n* Marvell will innovate in 5G via the Inphi acquisition, and it already has high-speed optical interconnect systems. Hyperscale data centres are using Marvell’s technology. It has also collaborated with Dell to launch the “Dell Open RAN Accelerator Card”. Marvell is showcasing it’s Open RAN technology at MWC 2022. It is also collaborating with Meta. 5G is a rapidly expanding technology set to transform entire industries. \n* Marvell’s Brightlane targets ADAS and in-vehicle infotainment. It is expected to grow in this segment due to increasing demand. Despite a significant decline in the automotive industry due to COVID, it is expected to grow in future due to: vehicle safety, regulations, rising disposable income, rising popularity of ADAS, the emergence of MEMS (Micro-electromechanical systems), Internet of Things (IoT) demand, increasing demand for (lightweight, electric and hybrid) vehicles.\n* Networking/data centre’s revenue contribute to 41% of the total revenue in Q4 2021. Carrier Infrastructure is separately contributing to revenues. The company provides a broad range of ethernet switch chips, processors and baseband chipsets as well as custom ASICs for edge, cloud and carrier customers. It has a partnership with TSMC. It also provides storage solution products used in SSDs and HDDs, which are in turn used in data centres. \n* To summarise, Marvell is very well positioned to take advantage of data centre growth, 5G buildup, and connected and autonomous vehicles.\n\n**In the next part of the DD I will cover:**\n\n* Storage controllers. \n* Security solutions.\n* Data Processing Units (DPU’s).\n* Information around earnings, options interest, future growth, technical analysis etc.\n* Any other notable topics I find that I haven’t already covered. \n\n**Marvell acquired electro-optics supplier Inphi for data centres:**\n\nThis deal was completed in April 2021, it is expected to lead to strong long-term incremental revenue growth of 5% on average through 2025 driven by the fast-growing silicon photonics market. It is also expected to grow networking revenues over 70% YoY by Q2 2022. Inphi’s strength is in electro-optics, serving hyperscale cloud providers such as Amazon and Google/Alphabet. \nThe combination of Inphi’s platform with Marvell’s copper Ethernet PHY will create a high speed data interconnect platform, which should outperform or stand above others. This acquisition will drive growth for Marvell, and could lead to being a 30% piece of Marvell’s total revenue by 2025. This will increase Marvell’s momentum in the cloud data centre market. \n\nDr. Ford Tamer served as Inphi’s president and CEO for more than nine years. Under his leadership Inphi became a market leader for electro-optics solutions. He has been appointed to Marvell’s board of director upon the acquisition. He previously served as CEO of Telegent Systems, and SVP/GM of Broadcom’s Infrastructure Networking Group. He will be a valuable member of the board. \n\nInphi produces high-speed analog and mixed-signal semiconductor components and optical subsystems for the communications and computing markets. It also offers a high speed interface between analog signals and digital information in systems including telecommunications transport systems, enterprise networking equipment, data centre and enterprise servers, as well as storage platforms. \n \nCore technologies:\n\n* High-speed analog ICs\n* PAM4\n* Coherent DSPs\n* Silicon photonics\n* Digital signal processors\n* TiAs\n* Drivers\n* Retimers\n* Gearbox\n* Opto-electronics\n \nFranchise products:\n\n* COLORZ\n* Polaris™ 1st 200G PAM4 DSP\n* Vega™ PAM4 FEC Gearbox Retimer\n* Porrima™ 400G PAM4 DSP\n* Spica™ 800G DSP\n* PAM4 Silicon\n* DWDM optical modules\n \n&gt; *Marvell CEO statement:*\n\n&gt; “I am excited to welcome the Inphi team to Marvell and look forward to realizing the tremendous value creation potential of this combination for our customers, employees and shareholders. Together we will have the portfolio, capabilities, and scale to expand Marvell’s leadership in its key growth end markets of 5G, Cloud and Automotive,” said Matt Murphy, president and CEO of Marvell. “I am also pleased that we are now organized as a U.S. company and we look forward to continuing to drive innovation in semiconductor technology critical to the nation’s data economy.”\n \n&gt; *Inphi CEO statement:*\n\n&gt; “Marvell and Inphi share a vision to enable the world\'s data infrastructure and we have both transformed our respective businesses to benefit from the strong secular growth expected in the cloud data center and 5G wireless markets” said Ford Tamer, President and CEO of Inphi.\n \n**Section TL;DR:**\n\n* Marvell acquired Inphi in April 2021.\n* Expected to drive long-term incremental revenue growth 5% on avg through 2025, and grow networking revenues 70% YoY by Q2 2022.\n* Inphi is strong in electro-optics, serving hyperscale cloud providers (eg Amazon and Google/Alphabet).\n* With combined products, this deal will lead to a market leading high-speed data interconnect platform.\n* Inphi could account for 30% of Marvell’s revenue by 2025..\n* Dr. Ford Tamer (Inphi’s president/CEO) joins the board of directors at Marvell. \n* Inphi is based in the communications, computing, telecommunications transport systems, enterprise networking equipment, data centre, and enterprise servers, as well as storage platforms. \n\n**Innovium Acquisition:**\n\nInnovium develops and deploys it’s technologies to address the most challenging issues facing cloud and edge data centres. It specialises in advanced scalable Ethernet switch silicon, with the goal of providing clients with a single consistent scalable switch architecture that offers both high performance and a good feature set. It’s leading product is Teralynx, an Ethernet switch silicon family which delivers analytics, standards-based programmability, and power efficiency. This enables data centres and companies to deploy fewer network switches and tiers; thereby reducing cost, power and latency. Marvell adds engineering resources to innovate in cloud-optimised silicon through the Teralynx platform, to be named the Prestera 9K product series (Marvell also plans to advance its 2K and 8K product series which are aimed at the enterprise and carrier switch market).\n \nThe deal was completed in October 2021, it had a $1.1 billion price tag, including Innovium cash and exercise proceeds worth approximately $145 million. This resulted in a net cost to Marvell of $955 million. Innovium had an impressive market share of 29% in Q4 2020, and is the only company so far to challenge Broadcom which had a 70% market share. This acquisition allows Marvell to obtain a more substantial portfolio to face what lies ahead in networking (chiplets, onboard optics, and silicon photonics). It also allows it to grow ASIC market share, with more OEM/ODM ASIC choices, and increased innovation and R&amp;D in this market. Ethernet switches will be critical to deploying AI and Machine Learning, and other future workload technologies. Marvell can now complete more broadly against competitors such as Broadcom, Intel, AMD, ARM, Texas Instruments, and Microchip. Following the acquisitions of Inphi and Innovium, Broadcom and Intel will need to step up their game and directly respond, or risk falling behind the strong momentum Marvell has with hyperscalers and other cloud service providers. \n \nNow Marvell can target a wider range of chip-level cloud DC needs, including:\n\n* Cloud-optimized Ethernet switches per the Innovium deal\n* High-speed Electro-Optical PAM4 and Coherent DSP chipsets (Inphi)\n* OCTEON-based DPUs for security, offload, and acceleration\n* Custom Arm-based service CPUs\n* Full custom ASICs\n* Bravera Flash and HDD-based storage\n* Pluggable COLORZ DCI modules\n \nInnovium’s CTO and Founder Puneet Agarwall, with 20 years of experience in developing groundbreaking products, has joined Marvell following this acquisition. He will serve as an advisor to Marvell, and the talented Innovium team will continue to grow the cloud-optimised switch solutions that they provide. \n \nThis acquisition has essentially further stepped up Marvell’s cloud data centre game, further developing their strength in the Ethernet switch semiconductor market, and allowing them to participate in the fastest growing segment of this market. Marvell has also secured Innovium’s channels throughout the merchant cloud semiconductor switching market. This acquisition is a move to target the biggest data centre spenders in the world, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google. \n \n&gt; “Data center capex spending by hyperscale operators—led by AWS, Microsoft, Google and Facebook— reached $38 billion in just the first quarter of 2021 alone, according to IT research firm Synergy Research Group.” (CRN)\n \n&gt; *Marvell CEO statement:*\n\n&gt; “Our acquisition of Innovium and its complementary offerings further extends Marvell’s leadership in the cloud, and I am excited that Innovium has secured significant share at a marquee cloud customer,” said Matt Murphy, President and CEO of Marvell. “Innovium has established itself as a strong cloud data center merchant switch silicon provider with a proven platform, and we look forward to working with their talented team who have a strong track record in the industry for delivering multiple generations of highly successful products.”\n \n&gt; *Innovium CEO statement:*\n\n&gt; “The Innovium vision is centered on delivering breakthrough switch silicon and choice for next-generation cloud and edge data centers. Bringing technology leadership and customer-focused innovation to the market is what drives our team every day,” said Rajiv Khemani, CEO and Founder of Innovium. “I want to recognize and thank our valued employees for their passion, commitment, and outstanding execution. We are excited to join Marvell and accelerate the growth of our business, partnerships, and solution value, while contributing to the company’s fast-growing cloud opportunity.”\n \n&gt; ‘“For hyperscale operators, the pandemic proved to be more of a stimulus to growth rather than a barrier,” said John Dinsdale, a chief analyst at Synergy Research Group, in an email to CRN. “Over the last four quarters, we continued to see extremely strong growth in revenue, capex and data center spending.”\n \n&gt; Dinsdale said given the ongoing growth in service revenue for hyperscalers and the “ever-increasing need for a larger global data centre footprint,” Synergy is forecasting double-digit growth in hyperscale capex over the next several years.’ (CRN, Aug 09 2021)\n \n**Section TL;DR:**\n\n* Innovium specialises in advanced scalable Ethernet switch silicon.\n* It’s leading product is Teralynx, enabling data centres/companies to deploy fewer network switches and tiers; thereby reducing cost, power and latency. \n* Marvell will innovate upon Teralunx to introduce the Prestera 9K product series. \n* Deal had a $1.1 billion price tag, completed in October 2021.\n* Innovium had a 29% market share in Q4 2020, it is the only company to challenge Broadcom (70% market share).\n* Deal allows Marvell to obtain a more substantial portfolio to face the future in networking, as well as growing ASIC market share.

He will serve as an advisor, and the Innovium team will continue to grow cloud-optimised switch solutions.\n* This deal strengthens Marvell’s cloud data centre game and position in the Ethernet switch semi market. It also secures Innoviums channels in the merchant cloud semi switching market. \n \n**Other Acquisitions:**\n\nThroughout the years Marvell has acquired numerous companies, check the wikipedia for this.\n \n**Marvell’s 5G exposure:**\n\nMarvell will innovate in 5G through its acquisition of Inphi. Marvell optical interconnect solutions reliably move 100’s of gigabits per second, even over large distances (thousands of kilometers). Marvell has also been awarded numerous Supplier of the year awards by the world’s leading optical module companies.\n \nMany carriers are choosing Marvell’s optical connectivity technology to meet stringent requirements in the 5G sector. Announced in 2017, the Polaris PAM4 DSP, which is Marvell’s foundation technology for 5G networks, has shipped millions of ports. Hyperscale data centres have been connected using Polaris by some of the world’s most demanding tier one cloud providers. Building on the success of Polaris, Marvell have recently released the AtlasOne PAM4 DSP.\n \n&gt; “From Smart Cities to wireless industrial automation, to autonomous driving and good ‘old fashioned’ smartphone video or gaming, the fifth generation of wireless technology can truly transform how we live and work.  The ability of 5G to enable innovative new services and enhanced mobile broadband experiences requires increased transport bandwidth that connects all key elements in the data path from the radio tower, across the edge to the core network.  With superior performance, reliability and economies of scale proven with hyperscale data center operators, direct detect optics utilizing robust PAM4 modulation are playing an essential role in developing future-ready 5G infrastructure — today.” (Marvell)\n \n*Marvell partners with Dell to bridge 5G Open RAN performance gap:*\n\nMarvell and Dell have launched a solution to address the current performance challenges of Open RAN deployment in virtualized distributed unit environments. This accelerator card is used for servers in 5G networks. It was announced on the 22nd of February ahead of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) conference. Named the “Dell Open RAN Accelerator Card”, it uses Marvell’s Octeon. Octeon is a chip that handles networking and security chores. They can scale to 16 cores and are programmable. Octeon is often found in a network interface controller, and when loaded with modestly-powerful compute cores and a little storage these NIC’s become a SmartNIC. SmartNICs are now the standard for hyperscalers such s Alibaba, Baidu and Google/Alphabet. As they work to move data, SmartNICs are now described as data-processing units (DPUs), and are essential for demanding workloads like AI/ML. I will cover DPU’s in more detail later in this DD. \n \nWith that information on Octeon, let\'s move back to the Accelerator Card. The use of Octeon enables the CPU’s housed in the PowerEdge servers used in 5G networks to be freed from processing Layer 1 traffic, hence allowing the CPU’s to focus on running the Open RAN. Freeing up the CPU for critical workloads, and instead using an accelerator to handle plumbing is the same reasoning Intel, Nvidia, Pensando, and most hyperscale clouds offer adding DPU’s to servers. \n \nThe card, which is designed for Dell PowerEdge and other x86-based servers, also features PTP syncing, which enables various parts of a telco network to be synchronised. This thereby eliminates the need for additional modules in order to orchestrate the synchronisation. \n \n&gt; \'Speaking with ZDNet, Dell Technologies Asia Pacific and Japan head of telecom Sam Saba explained the Open RAN Accelerator Card has been designed to bring the performance of traditional RAN solution to Open RAN.\n&gt; "[There\'s] this gap of performance and energy consumption. Effectively, we believe now this card will bridge that performance," he said.\n&gt;  "The way we\'re doing this is through what we call the layer 1 offload. With that, we\'re looking at taking all that layer 1 processing out of the standard CPU that sits in the server, which occupies 60-70% of overall processing capacity … and putting it in a PCIe card in line into the virtual distributed unit close to the base station … in doing that we\'re effectively relieving, or releasing, a lot of the capacity in the standard processing card to do more processing."’ (ZDNet)\n \n&gt; ‘“Marvell is delighted to partner with Dell Technologies to enable an open, virtualised 5G RAN architecture that delivers advanced features and performance built on our proven OCTEON Fusion platform,” said Raj Singh, executive vice president, Processors Business Unit at Marvell.\n \n&gt; “The new Dell Open RAN Accelerator Card is an innovative no-compromise, cloud-native, in-line, Open RAN Layer 1 acceleration solution that addresses the shortcomings of existing vRAN alternatives.”\n \n&gt; “We’re pleased to see Dell Technologies and Marvell come together to innovate and create technologies that will enhance Open RAN platform capability and vendor diversity for operators,” said Andy Dunkin, Open RAN RF and digital platform development manager at Vodafone.\n \n&gt; “The promise of virtualised Open RAN platforms will be enhanced with the Dell Open Ran Accelerator Card that should offer network operators like Vodafone a less costly and more efficient path to Open RAN.”\n \n*‘Marvell Technology : showcases its new no-compromise Open RAN solution with ecosystem partners (ARM and Meta) using best of cloud, wireless compute architectures’ (marketscreener/Marvell):*\n \nI could only find one article for this, but it appears that Marvell is also separately showcasing it’s Open RAN architecture (linked to the previously mentioned one, but not in collaboration with Dell. It appears the Dell card builds upon this technology). This uses its Octeon Fusion processor, and is in collaboration with ARM and Meta to drive adoption of 5G Open Ran solutions. Marvell’s new 5G Open RAN Accelerator will be on display at Mobile World Congress 2022, at the ARM booth. Marvell has extensive compute collaboration with ARM, and it is possible that this will increase Open RAN capabilities for ecosystem initiatives such as the Meta Connectivity Evenstar program, which is aiming to expand the global adoption of Open RAN.\n \n5G is already a rapidly expanding technology, which is being rolled out by every major operator worldwide. 5G’s high bandwidth and low latency is powering applications such as the metaverse, autonomous driving, industrial Internet of Things (IoT), private networks and more. 5G is set to transform entire industries, serving the world’s connectivity needs for years. The networks themselves are undergoing changes in architecture, specifically, that significant portions of the 5G radio access network (RAN) are moving into the cloud. Hyperscale clouds as well as software defined networks, have accelerated innovation, value creation and growth across nearly every industry. It is a data centre revolution, where technologies such as virtualisation, disaggregation and open standards enable agility, efficiency and massive scalability. These benefits have great appeal to 5G carriers that are pursuing large growth opportunities in the industrial and enterprise markets. \n \nWith disaggregation and open interfaces, carriers will also have the opportunity to evolve 5G RAN to a more flexible architecture which optimises bandwidth, power and cost, thereby allowing diverse network traffic conditions and advanced features such as a Massive MIMO.\n \nThe Evenstar program by Meta Connectivity is a collaborative industry effort working towards expanding the global adoption of Open RAN. Through a unified platform architecture, Evenstar removes interoperability risk and helps mobile network operators deploy Open RAN solutions. Meta Connectivity is collaborating with Marvell to optimise performance, cost and power efficiency in 5G Networks. \n \n&gt; “We at Marvell are proud of our collaborations with Arm and Meta Connectivity to facilitate 5G-Cloud convergence. Our no-compromise 5G Open RAN solution represents a big step forward. With open standards and proven, best-in-class RAN features and the virtualization and scaling techniques used in the most advanced clouds, we are helping to realize the promises of 5G and fuel our world with intelligent connectivity.” (Marvell)\n \n**Section TL;DR:**\n\n* Marvell will innovate in 5G via Inphi acquisition.\n* Marvell has high speed optical interconnect systems.\n* Hyperscale data centres are using Marvell’s technology.\n* Marvell and Dell have launched an Open RAN solution called the “Dell Open RAN Accelerator Card”, which allows the CPU in PowerEdge severs used in 5G networks to focus on running Open RAN. \n* Marvell is showcasing it’s Open RAN technology in the ARM booth at the Mobile World Congress 2022. \n* It is also collaborating with Meta for the Meta Connectivity Evenstar program. \n* 5G is a rapidly expanding technology set to transform entire industries. \n \n**Automotive industry:**\n\nMarvell’s Brightlane Ethernet chips are targeted for ADAS (advanced driver-assistance systems) and in-vehicle infotainment. This is one of Marvell’s smallest market segments, but Marvell is expecting to grow in this area due to increasing demand. Marvell offers a complete portfolio of Automotive Brightlane Ethernet PHY, tracievers, bridges and switches supporting speeds of 100Mbps to 10Gbps with enhanced safety and security features. These security features protect automotive networks from malicious attacks. This portfolio is described as a ‘One-stop shop for in-vehicle networking’ by Marvell.\n \nIn December 2021, Marvell introduced the industry’s first multi-gig Ethernet camera bridge solution. This is the latest addition to Marvell’s Brightlane automotive portfolio. The new bridge provides standardisation for in-vehicle distribution in multiple areas. \n \n&gt; “We are extending our leadership in Ethernet-based solutions to enable autonomous driving and usher in the next generation of automotive architectures,” said Will Chu, senior vice president and general manager of the Automotive Business Unit, Marvell. “Marvell’s newest Ethernet bridge solution builds on the introduction of our multi-gig 802.3ch Ethernet 10Gbps PHY, integrated with image sensor interface. The new Ethernet device underscores Marvell’s commitment to enabling smarter, safer and greener vehicles with innovative automotive networking, storage, compute and security semiconductor solutions.” (Marvell)\n \n&gt; “Marvell’s Ethernet-based bridges are becoming an essential component for the software-defined cars of today,” said Ian Riches, vice president for the Global Automotive Practice, Strategy Analytics. “Not only do Ethernet-based products fit seamlessly into a zonal architecture, but with 802.3ch they are also proving to be an attractive alternative to the SerDes solutions currently used to transport video data in the vehicle.” (Marvell)\n \n&gt; “Today’s high-speed long-distance camera to ECU communication are proprietary point-to-point protocols that narrow our customers’ design options, which is why they have been requesting a standardized protocol such as Ethernet,” said Stephen Harris, director of Automotive Systems Architecture at onsemi. “Marvell’s 88QB5224 is a single chip 10 Gbps standard Ethernet PHY solution that provides the fast speed needed to enable our portfolio of high-performance, ultra-dynamic range image sensors. onsemi has become the leader in automotive imaging by developing and supporting innovative solutions in this space and is excited to be an early adopter of 88QB5224 by adding it to our popular MARS (Modular Automotive Reference System) development platform.”  (Marvell)\n \nThe automotive industry suffered a significant decline in sales during the pandemic. Thereby decreasing demand for automotive ethernet. Manufacturing plants stopped production to avoid further losses, and governments of various countries banned import-export activities. Thereby hampering growth of this market. However, there are numerous factors expected to influence and increase growth in future. \n \nThe automotive ethernet market size was $2.1 billion in 2021. It is forecasted to grow to $11.1 billion by 2030. Automotive ethernet can increase vehicle safety. Increasing consumer awareness and favourable government regulations pertaining to safety will likely have a positive impact on the market. The European Commission has also announced a new regulation related to the implementation of Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) for light vehicles. These factors increase market growth. \n \nRising disposable income will also increase demand for luxury vehicles which offer advanced services (using automotive ethernet). Increasing popularity of ADAS, and the emergence of MEMS (Micro-electromechanical systems) will drive automotive ethernet market growth.  There are also trends such as the increasing demand of Internet of Things (IoT) in automotive. As well as the increasing demand for lightweight, electric and hybrid vehicles. Both these factors drive growth. \n \n**Section TL;DR:**\n\n* Marvell’s Brightlane are targeted for ADAS (advanced driver-assistance systems) and in-vehicle infotainment.\n* Expecting to grow in this segment due to increasing demand. \n*  Marvell offers a complete portfolio of Automotive Brightlane Ethernet PHY, tracievers, bridges and switches supporting speeds of 100Mbps to 10Gbps with enhanced safety and security features.\n* The automotive industry suffered a significant decline in sales during the pandemic. But there are numerous factors expected to increase growth in future. \n* The automotive ethernet market size was $2.1 billion in 2021. It is forecasted to grow to $11.1 billion by 2030.\n* Vehicle safety, regulations, rising disposable income, rising popularity of ADAS, the emergence of MEMS (Micro-electromechanical systems), Internet of Things (IoT) demand, increasing demand for (lightweight, electric and hybrid) vehicles; these are all factors that will drive growth. \n \nI had a section that summarised recent articles from Marvell’s blog. But I decided to remove it in the interest of being concise. If you want to do further reading, I recommend checking it out:\n\n**Competition in the data centre market: Broadcom, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, ARM, Texas Instruments, and Microchip:**\n\n* Broadcom has a 70% market share in ASICs for data centres. Marvell has a 29% share. \n* Nvidia has also expanded aggressively in the data centre market. NVIDIA holds 90% market share in supercomputer accelerators.\n* Intel’s CPU’s power 77% of servers in 2021.\n* AMD’s CPU’s power 18% of servers in 2021. AMD also uses its GPU architecture for data centres. ‘The enterprise, embedded and semi-custom segment saw an increase of 69% to $1.9 billion driven by EPYC process and semi-custom’ YoY in 2021 (fierceelectronics)\n* One in twenty servers (170,000 units) shipped between July and September 2021 were using an ARM CPU. \n* Texas Instruments are competing with Marvell in the data centre, industrial and automotive markets. They produce cheaper analog and embedded chips which support power management, wireless and data transfer features for a myriad of devices. I can’t find an exact figure in comparison to Marvell, but here’s some useful data: ‘In 2020, TI generated 37% of its revenue from the industrial market, 20% from the automotive market, 27% from personal electronics, 8% from communications equipment, and 6% from enterprise systems. The remaining 2% came from other markets.’ (Nasdaq). TI held about 8.3% of the auto semiconductor market in 2020. \n* Microchip Technology has a 3.13% market share in comparison to competitors Q4 2021. \n \n**Networking and data centre segment:**\n\nI’ve already covered a lot of this in my writeups about Inphi and Innovium and 5G, so for this section I’ll try and include any information I haven’t already covered. Further information about the networking/data centre segment will be included in the Data Processing Unit (DPUs) section and Storage Solutions section. \n \nNetworking/data centre’s accounts for a large portion of Marvell’s revenue, data centre revenues contributed to 41% of the total in Q4 2021. \n\n“On an end market basis, Data Center revenues, which contributed 41% to total revenues, stood at $499.7 million, up 109% year-over-year. Additionally, Carrier Infrastructure contributed revenues of $215.1 million, up 28%, while revenues at Enterprise networking came in at $247.2 million, up 56%. \nFurthermore, Consumer Market revenues of $182.5 million rose 20%, while Automotive/industrial revenues grew 114% to $66.6 million.” (Nasdaq)\n\n&gt; ‘Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said, "For the fourth quarter, we are expecting sequential revenue growth of 9 percent at the midpoint of guidance, led by 5G, which is projected to increase by 30 percent sequentially and data center which is forecasted to continue to grow in the double digits on a percentage basis."’ (Nasdaq)\n\nThe company provides a broad range of ethernet switch chips, processors and baseband chipsets as well as custom ASICs for edge, cloud and carrier customers. It has a partnership with TSMC.\n\nAccording to GM insights, Data Center Networking market size was estimated at $20 billion in 2020, it is expected to grow to $45 billion in 2027. \n\nMarvell has a wide range of networking solutions, including FastLinQ Ethernet network adapters and controllers, Ethernet Switches, Ethernet PHYs and Automotive Ethernet.\n\nIt’s data centre products include: Marvell OCTEON and AMADA DPU’s, as well as custom versions of these, and custom ASICs. \n\nIt’s storage solution products are used in SSDs and HDDs, which are in turn used in data centres. These products include SSD Controllers, HDD Controllers, HDD Preamplifiers, Storage Accelerators, and QLogic Fibre Channel Adapters and Controllers. On May 27, 2021, Marvell announced its first NVM Express SSD controllers to support PCI Express 5.0.\nMarvell offers a range of security solutions, including LiquidSecurity HSM Adapters and NITROX Cryptographic Offload Engine.\n\n**Section TL;DR:**\n\n* Networking/data centre’s accounts for a large portion of Marvell’s revenue, data centre revenues contributed to 41% of the total in Q4 2021. \n* Carrier Infrastructure also contributes significantly to revenues. \n* The company provides a broad range of ethernet switch chips, processors and baseband chipsets as well as custom ASICs for edge, cloud and carrier customers. It has a partnership with TSMC.\n* It also provides storage solution products used in SSDs and HDDs, which are in turn used in data centres. \n \nTo summarise, Marvell is very well positioned to take advantage of data centre growth, 5G buildup, and connected and autonomous vehicles.\n\n**In the next part of the DD I will cover:**\n\n* Storage controllers. \n* Security solutions.\n* Data Processing Units (DPU’s).\n* Information around earnings, options interest, future growth, technical analysis etc.\n* Any other notable topics I find that I haven’t already covered.\n\n**General TL;DR/TL;DR of the section TL;DR’s:**\n\n* Marvel acquired Inphi in April 2021, a strong company in electro-optics, serving hyperscale cloud providers. The deal is expected to drive long-term incremental growth by 5% on avg through 2025. Inphi could account for 30% of Marvell’s revenue by 2025. Dr. Ford Tamer (Inphi’s president/CEO) joins the board of directors at Marvell. \n* Marvell has acquired Innovium for $1.1 billion in, which had a 29% market share in Q4 2020. The deal allows Marvell to obtain a more substantial portfolio to face the future in networking. Marvell now can compete more broadly against competitors (Broadcom, Intel, Texas Instruments, and Microchip). Marvell now has stronger momentum with hyperscalers and cloud service providers. The Innovium CTO/Founder Puneet Agarwall, with 20 years of experience, has joined Marvell as an advisor. This deal strengthens Marvell’s cloud data centre game and position in the Ethernet switch semi market. It also secures Innoviums channels in the merchant cloud semi switching market. \n* Marvell will innovate in 5G via the Inphi acquisition, and it already has high-speed optical interconnect systems. Hyperscale data centres are using Marvell’s technology. It has also collaborated with Dell to launch the “Dell Open RAN Accelerator Card”. Marvell is showcasing it’s Open RAN technology at MWC 2022. It is also collaborating with Meta. 5G is a rapidly expanding technology set to transform entire industries. \n* Marvell’s Brightlane targets ADAS and in-vehicle infotainment. It is expected to grow in this segment due to increasing demand. Despite a significant decline in the automotive industry due to COVID, it is expected to grow in future due to: vehicle safety, regulations, rising disposable income, rising popularity of ADAS, the emergence of MEMS (Micro-electromechanical systems), Internet of Things (IoT) demand, increasing demand for (lightweight, electric and hybrid) vehicles.\n* Networking/data centre’s revenue contribute to 41% of the total revenue in Q4 2021. Carrier Infrastructure is separately contributing to revenues. The company provides a broad range of ethernet switch chips, processors and baseband chipsets as well as custom ASICs for edge, cloud and carrier customers. It has a partnership with TSMC. It also provides storage solution products used in SSDs and HDDs, which are in turn used in data centres. \n* To summarise, Marvell is very well positioned to take advantage of data centre growth, 5G buildup, and connected and autonomous vehicles.'), ('Never give up.

It isn\'t hard to find them.  Why not put a short on those instead of SPY?  You should know that all the major hedge funds and wall street pros are laughing at this sub because of they cannot even think of one of the above points.  Now, if you want to make a short term play to the downside then I don\'t see anything wrong with it.  However, this morning we saw a massive recovery after the futures gapped down 2.5%.  On Friday we also saw a massive Fuck You rally on Thursday and Friday.  I\'m sure a lot of you kids made a good chunk of change shorting the recent dips, but plenty more most likely overleveraged their portfolio going short and lost their ass on the elevator ride up.  So what is going on?  Is it fraud?  Are the algos burning through billions of dollars to manipulate the market away from your shit 5 delta put that is worth nothing to begin with?  Is Powell buying stocks?  No, all of these are retarded as shit.  Here is what is happening:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Low interest rates cause cash to flow into US equities because there is no alternative (TINA)**\n\nIf you are a fund manager or some rich dude you have piles of cash on hand.  The question is, what do you do with it?  Let\'s keep in mind that inflation is at 2% (right now it\'s higher) and the 10 year note has a yield below 2 percent, it doesn\'t even beat inflation.  Also, if interest rates rise then the value of your bond [falls](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/why-interest-rates-have-inverse-relationship-bond-prices/).   This means that you basically only find yield in US equities.  Thus when they all have piles of cash, which they [do](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL), you see it start to flow into the SPX in one way or another.  In essence cash, bonds, and equities are all competing for their share of  cash flow in a zero sum game.  A lot of people think of P/E as what determines if an equity is overvalued or not, but this is not the case.  We need to adjust for bond yields.  The current record high [P/E](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp)\'s do not make sense on their own, but they do when you adjust for bond yields.  Thankfully we have professionals that can do the math for us and post this data for free.  Dr. Edward Yardeni has a really good blog and shares the information regularly.  Check figure 8 [here](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/valuationfed.pdf). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Market Makers hedge their options in a way the creates upward skew in most cases, and violent drawdowns in rare cases**\n\nThis next point is very intricate and requires a lot of knowledge on how options work and how to properly hedge them with static deltas.  I might expand on this later but for know I\'ll give a brief explanation and leave you with this if you want to learn [more](https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The_Implied_Order_Book.pdf).   \n\nPension funds are long equities.  This means that they sometimes buy puts for protection.  They will also sell covered calls against these equities to boost their returns.  Now the market makers are on the other side of this trade.  Hence they are long calls and short puts.  These market makers must hedge their risk by buying or shorting the underlying when appropriate.  When you are long calls you short stock to neutralize your deltas.  Another way to think about it is that you lose money if the market goes down, so you short some stock to hedge this downside risk.  Because of the way delta and gamma work the market maker will short the rallies and buy the dips to hedge their long calls.  This creates a sticky mean reverting type of environment in the market and thus drives down volatility (vix).  Lower vix means puts get squeezed which means shorts cover and the market drifts up.  You can type equity index gamma modeling into google scholar and get some hard resources to look at if you want.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'ll probably write about reverse repo and quantitative easing next time but idk.

It’s  targeting growth of at least 4% for service and other revenue in 2024.\n\n“We’ve done quite a lot in the last couple of years, and we  stand here right now with more growth opportunity than we’ve ever had  before,” Vestberg said. He pointed to its recent acquisition  of value wireless brand TracFone and its large purchase of C-Band  spectrum in early 2021, a move to help build out 5G in the U.S. He also  mentioned its sale of Verizon Media last year.\n\n“We built a network for many, many different things, a multi-purpose network,” Vestberg said.\n\nVerizon also announced Thursday that it entered into a strategic partnership with Facebook parent Meta.  It’s focused on how Verizon’s 5G network and computing power can help  build out the so-called metaverse, a new and major priority for the Mark  Zuckerberg-led social media firm.\n\nVestberg stressed it’s still  early innings for the development of these immersive, digital worlds  known as the metaverse. The concept was not even on his radar when he  joined Verizon in 2017, initially as chief technology officer and  president of Global Networks, he said. He became CEO in 2018.\n\n“We’re  just starting in that area .... and actually that’s not even in my  numbers for the future because it’s so early,” Vestberg said. “But  clearly we built a network that’s so different than anybody else in the  market. That’s why we talked to Meta, and that’s why they chose to work  with us.”\n\nVerizon shares rose nearly 1% Thursday, closing at $54.66, to bring  its year-to-date gains to 5.2%. The S&amp;P 500 is down 8.5% in the same  span.\n\nInvestors don’t look to telecommunications firms like  Verizon for eye-popping revenue growth. The stocks tend to be seen as a  relatively defensive play, with their dividends being a key reason some  income-seeking investors want to own them. Verizon boasts a dividend  yield of 4.7% based on Thursday’s close.\n\nCramer asked Vestberg  whether the company’s emphasis on growth initiatives will hold back  Verizon in further boosting its dividend payout.\n\nThe CEO said  Verizon has a clear capital allocation strategy, with the top priority  being reducing its capital intensity to under 12% in 2024. The second  priority is continuing to grow the dividend, Vestberg said.\n\n“Then  after that, we pay down our debt and then we come to the repurchase of  shares and today we talked about that as well, that we will now start  considering doing repurchasing earlier than we had said before,” he  said.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/03/verizon-ceo-sees-strong-growth-ahead-says-dividend-growth-still-priority.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/03/verizon-ceo-sees-strong-growth-ahead-says-dividend-growth-still-priority.html)'), ('Robinhood Options Values are Highly Inaccurate', 'Robinhood Options Values are Highly InaccurateWent to sell my AMD $116 FD’s this morning for pennies on the dollar.

The daily candle (which im sure someone else will inform me its something different) is more or less a doji candle too which can be a reversal indicator but in simplest of terms is just a indecision candle.\n\nKey levels to watch.\n\nSupport- 427.1 (the low from March 1st) \uf0e0 421.4 ( the low from Feb 23 and the mid point of the grey channel)\n\nResistance- 434.3 (8 ema) 437 (resistance line from the high of feb 10th and Mar 3rd) \uf0e0 438.34 (20 ema) \uf0e0 439.23 (200 ema) \uf0e0 445 (upper resistance of the channel)\n\nSince I will not be posted a pre-market on Monday here are the levels\n\n0.5%= 434.3\n\n1= 436.5\n\n1.5%= 438.7\n\n2%= 440.8\n\n\\-0.5%= 430\n\n\\-1%= 427.8\n\n\\-1.5%= 425.7\n\n\\-2%= 423.5\n\n10% challenge-\n\nHow did you guys do?

It was trading around $265 went about $45 out or 17% out, and opened the position with 15mins left in the day. MY BEST WIN! I ALMOST WENT ALL IN on $220 puts!

I honestly thought I would go down, but not by much after a nice gap up from earnings, but it tanked a bit, I was able to get out right at the bell, put some limit orders in and they filled.

Commodities are soaring: wheat futures, crude oil futures.  While the big money does not want to admit it, the inflation data released on the 10th will be worse than most people are expecting.   The situation in Ukraine is sadly not getting any better; Russia announced a ceasefire and then continued to shell buildings.  Since inflation is getting worse and commodities are soaring the fed is now forced into drastic measures to raise the interest rates.\n\nFrom the technical indicators the whole market is extremely bearish.

There is stuff but all minor compared to the income level. And I don\'t get it, we are not talking about a start up investing ahead of the curve or lacking scale. So I looked at the operating expenses and then I fell off my chair. \n\n**The R&amp;D expenses are $1.4b, meaning more than 30% of sales**. In comparison, NVIDIA spends 6%, Apple 7%, AMD spends 8% and Microsoft 13%. What is going on? Are they allocating cost to R&amp;D to show higher margin? The R&amp;D expenses are the main reason of the lack of net income as well as stock compensation. And I could not find a good explanation to the scale in any documents including the investor day, last year 10k and other financial reportings. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5wo4uevg3il81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e1c048ed9c5e57e5e2b034c9bda338515a90dc7\n\nI look at the debt, good will and so on to see if they are leveraging to ride the wave and mislead investors to get as much as possible out for the management. The company has $4.4b in long term debt which seems fine for the size of the company, but it is not if they never generates higher net income. We also have a huge $11b goodwill which will likely be partially write off in the coming years. \n\nThe company is clearly leveraged but not excessively if the operating margin is real. But the $55b market cap is justified on the high "margin" and great future return to the shareholder. I don\'t see it having already the best market in years, size, acquisition synergies and growth; and despite this they still have a 2300 PE. \n\nI also look at what the management is doing with their shares. They should hold considering the bright future ahead.

He was referencing a picture of gasoline prices posted in California recently. Regular octane gasoline was $6.65 (and nine-tenths) per gallon. Premium octane gasoline was about $7.26 a gallon.\n\nElectric-vehicle penetration world-wide will be 60% by 2030, Black estimates. Tesla (ticker: TSLA) will have 20% EV share. With global light-vehicle sales at 85 million units, Tesla would be delivering about 10 million vehicles a year by the end of the decade, according to Black.\n\n\nNote: the article is EV centric.

I plan to keep an eye on the situation and re-enter if it corrects back down once things settle down.\n\n \n\nIn the other half of my options portfolio I have been playing $SPY put options to capitalize on the current downtrend, however last week when Canada upped their rates the Toronto Stock Exchange has seen some gains even as SPY has been falling. I exited my SPY position because I realized it could easily reverse rather than crash with the increased expectation of currency stability with FED action. Obviously though I am torn and still want to play the decline, I’m just not sure that the SPY will cooperate. Ultimately leaving my investment success in the hands of the FED is frustrating.\n\n \n\nSo here I am with a handful of cash from the supply chain issues stemming this time from global conflict instead of quarantine and another handful from the decline in value of equities in the S&amp;P500, and it is obvious what the play is to capitalize on both ongoing situations.\n\n \n\nBlackRock makes the vast majority of its revenue from fees it charges based on the value of its assets under management. As their AUM shrinks, so does its revenue. BlackRock has also earned itself a reputation with investing in companies the US does not approve of abroad as they have poured money into China especially in the last few years as they have bought up cheap assets effected by the Evergrande crisis in China. With a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, or financial alliance with Russia or any other threat even perceived that the Chinese economy might be effected similarly to Russia’s since the invasion of Ukraine, BlackRocks assets could take an additional massive hit. Also BlackRock will have no choice but to watch these assets disappear because no one is going to buy them if they even are allowed by their governments to.\n\n \n\nAll this to say I have and am still purchasing put options on BlackRock for when these next wave of supply issues are really being felt and BlackRock suffering hard as their domestic and foreign assets shrink substantially in value.

VIX is definitely something we will want to watch over night and early morning for some guidance. Obvious we saw SPY love the VIX coming down in price and many even expected VIX to get back below 30. If we got back below 30 VIX we easily could see SPY back around the 435-440 area. However, for now at least it does look like VIX has found a happy spot around high 31s to high 32s.

The first channel is a bull channel (recently developed) that IF we can hold support at 427.1 over night without an significant retracement we will stay in the bull channel. \n\n\\-\tIf we stay above 427.2 we will test the upper resistance of the downward bear channel near 429.4. Break that and we have a lot of upside to go. Reject there and we will retest the support of the bull channel and potentially break much lower. \n\n\\-\tBreak this 427.2 support at any point and there on SPY (not Futures or the daily) is an intraday pre market gap from 417.6 to 419 that I suspect we will fill.\n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1xok3lekfm81.png?width=826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7b51f4f3eaa8797973f08567aea5dd90a7db1a3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ydh4y5cfkfm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1e326bed53d1c9c2ea03d27fce1a5a069993909\n\nFutures ES actually shows quite a different picture then SPY… On futures we see it broke out of its downward channel which I attribute to the big bull run up today. However, it finds itself in a massive rising wedge that it looks like it just may retrace from. Support for Futures to watch is at 4276 and resistance of upper ascending triange is 4300.

On one hand we did break the daily 8 ema at 427.7 however, we failed to close the candle above it which can be seen as bearish short term. Had we closed above the 8 ema that would be considered very bullish. I have my channels still going here and I have added two new resistance lines.\n\n\\-\tFirst line is from 2/10 and 3/3 that has a resistance of 435 for tomorrow if it breaks out again\n\n\\-\tSecond line is from 3/3 and yesterday 3/8 which has a resistance of 427 for the high. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth of those are very real scenarios going into tomorrow. Currently we are all awaiting the next unknown of the markets which is the CPI datat which will drop officially at 830am tomorrow morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome are hypothesizing that the markets Monday priced in terrible CPI data which is why it sold off, while others say market priced in great CPI data (especially after chinas data was good last night). Overall, none of us know exactly what to morrow is going to bring but I expect if its worse then expected (I believe 8.0 is the expectation) we are going to see a nice sell off. If its at or better I think we will see another very green day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\nI did not make intraday trade today because when we see markets up 2.25% at open I don’t like to play the chance. Today despite all indicators pointing to bull run could have absolutely elevatored down at any point. Its not a risk to reward I prefer to take. \n\nI am switching from margin to cash account today so most of my funds were tied up.

My doctor has warned me about high cholesterol, my psychiatrist about the mega lottery environment of this sub, and my dealer about fake Sinaloa chalk. But most importantly, a friend of mine, an autist, has warned me about the EV startups. Specifically the SPAC EV start-ups, like RIDE. His rosacea beams when he talks about them, his voice booming with an authority that makes FOMO unavoidable. I found him last Saturday where he usually is in Sapphire (Times Square location). He wanted to talk about his investment newsletter he’s about to start putting out while a piece of Cuban meat ground expertly on him, contaminating our space with what I learned was an essence called Warm Vanilla, by Bath &amp; Body Works. I pressed him on which EV to short and how to do it. He slapped the Cuban’s ass and instantly appeared an enormous square-shaped bouncer from the shadow warning him. Normally this will get you thrown out, but he greases the place like the lesser Biden did Ukraine. Anyway, my friend became functional, getting his shit under control and staring at me. This was rare though, as he can hardly maintain eye contact. But it was dark enough, and he gets Bolivian marching powder from the same cats that sell to the anorexic towers overlooking Central Park, the half empty ones owned by a dozen shells working back to a czar colluding to replace Putin before he’s Grand Dragon of Finland and Arch Duke of Ukraine. \n\n“You sell a call at strike price A,” he said, “Then you buy a put at stake price A.”\n\nI thought about it a moment. “Isn’t that the equivalent of just shorting the stock?”\n\nHe laughed at me but was staring in the Cuban’s eyes. “The margin requirement is far less, way less.”\n\nIt’s amazing when stupid simple things like that get overlooked. With this strategy I can short RIDE to bankruptcy which will happen later this year and have enough money for violent YOLO’s as circumstances demand in what’s certain to be a volatile trader’s market. The autist explained the importance of lasers in the manufacture of semiconductors and modern batteries. He took a veiled shot at me claiming I’m familiar with neon at the liquor store I frequent, but neon gas is necessary for these lasers. He says Ukraine effectively exports all the world’s neon for these, and with the conflict, it’s pretty much over without Obama-style bailouts with Trump-sized denials. He calls shorting these EV’s a millionaire maker and that they’ve already enjoyed their stonk and meme gasps. \n\n“Now it’s time for them to get undressed by the buzzards.” \n\nThe FOMO this guy writes into me is like the bank robbery scene in the movie Heat. But suddenly the meat spoke, she said something interesting while we were briefly talking about Russia, her pleasing boobs rattling with each syllable:\n\n“Cubans don’t want their grandpa’s revolution, they want jobs. Putin no understand generational divide. Nobody cares about or wants their parent’s Soviet Union. Is gone. Culture change. World change. Globalization. Interdependent...”\n\nThe lecherous Patrick Bateman inside us all would’ve paid anything to smash this meat and leave it for dead. Trust me. Anything at all. NYC strippers are amazing, smart, cognizant creatures. Someday I want to get a list of all the old Harvey Weinstein haunts and try figuring out if they had anything to do with him shafting Saving Private Ryan from getting best picture in 1999. Anyway, knowing I’d be looking to make up for blue balls with another dancer in the Sapphire’s employ, I quickly left. I rode my bike back to Brooklyn, and in my apartment searched r/wallstreetbets for anyone of the same mind as my autist.

The stock closed at $2936.35 on Thursday.\n\nStock splits don’t change a company’s fundamental prospects, but they lower the price of each share, potentially attracting a wider swath of investors. In Amazon’s case, reducing the share price by 95% could make the company a contender for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which weights its 30 components by stock price rather than by market cap.\n\nWere the split to happen as of Wednesday’s close, the cost of each share would go from $2,785.58 to $139.28, and each existing holder would get 19 additional shares for every one they own. Amazon would have the 12th-smallest weighing among Dow stocks, which would put it in the middle of the pack, right alongside Walmart.\n\n“We believe AMZN is one of the biggest companies with a clear pulse on the American economy and not included in the Dow Jones Top 30 Index,” wrote Rohit Kulkarni, an analyst at MKM Partners, in a note to clients after the announcement.

Remember about 70% of the trades are done by algorithms; they move the markets.  I do not think a downtrend this strong will continue forever but in the short term... this is now a strong indicator.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Graphing Calculator](https://preview.redd.it/zbek7vc6sym81.png?width=1703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9d262038a846f2b2a31c9a32c5bc66acb6d2995)\n\nThis week I just changed the formulas so they automatically calculate the least squares line of regression and plot the offsetted lines from standard deviations.  There is lots of room to move downward on Monday opening since Friday closed at roughly the mean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Normal Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/yrify1vpsym81.png?width=1849&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bee35df9529badbad716c2b7e2e8b9bb078a3a5)\n\nThese formulas will calculate and shade a normal distribution curve for the statistically predicted price of SPY from the days past December 31st.  Normal distribution really does occur everywhere.  On the left side d = 73 which is the day of 3/14.  This is the statistically predicted price for SPY for Monday market close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Calculation for area of an inequality under normal distribution curve](https://preview.redd.it/w6qprtj7tym81.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=465f38af3fd8c4400990b9feb5fac64a2eb71e5e)\n\nFrom this model there is a 79.7% that SPY will close below 428 on Monday; good news to put holders and volatility ETF holders!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/empxx8bnuym81.png?width=1497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4edfae8679fab8b18cbe045b8ca17564dca41c3)\n\nThis is an extremely important indicator.  When the 50 day moving average crosses the 200 day moving average this is known as a death cross.  While the death cross is not 100% accurate it has predicted the worst bear markets: 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008.  There are funds that will not buy any stocks that have the 50 day moving average below the 200 day moving average because they will statistically underperform the overall market.  This is definitely something to pay attention to, it will be a major event signaling a bear market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[US Bonds Friday Close](https://preview.redd.it/0xjlc4txvym81.png?width=319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1bee5ab9a72f41582685d8650e1e12f8e2e5049)\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/dyreyc1ewym81.png?width=1493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7abbda83409990e8b1209e27f391c9f84a4ff2e)\n\nNot much to say about bonds, short terms are soaring and long terms are flat.  The yield curve is flattening... yes it is happening.  An inverted yield curve has predicted EVERY recession.  This is as close to a perfect indicator that you can get.  If this happens, the week the yield curve inverts will be insane, every fund will be panic selling.  Keep a close eye on bonds in the upcoming weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Federal Reserve Calendar](https://preview.redd.it/dgqqyx5jtym81.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9edb3ee2f4ccf88242a4868801f0d35591798167)\n\nLots of investors will be watching when the Fed has a meeting Tuesday and Wednesday followed by an announcement.  The big question is: 25bp or 50bp rate hike?\n\n[Purchasing Power](https://preview.redd.it/nvrrlt18bzm81.png?width=1048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=769c20c0dc442617b9717fc3e09e25788af1c345)\n\nThe purchasing power of the dollar is now worse than the peak of the financial crisis in 2008.

Many people are being misled by the federal reserve's reports.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dj3ldtjsozm81.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caf6be31bcab815af153808737b8342894ed3890\n\n**Predictions**\n\nWe are in for another rough week in the markets.  Even though there was 4 red days last week in the markets, nothing will be getting better.  The demand for commodities is increasing and the supply is only decreasing: last week Russia officially banned the export of wheat.  Although there was a correction there is is still an overall uptrend in most commodities.  \n\nThe stochastics are currently about 30 on SPY, not completely in the oversold range so there can still be strong selling pressure.  I think the support zone at 409 will be easily broken and then some buyers will start to step back in.\n\nTwo more major indicators are the death cross and yield curve.  When the death cross happens I am sure investors will panic but remember it is not a 100% guaranteed indicator.  The yield curve is a 100% indicator though.  3 year versus 10 year is flat.  If the 3 month yield exceeds the 10 year yield then that is almost a 100% indicator that there will be a recession in the next one to two years.\n\nThe important event happening this week is the FOMC meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.  There will be an announcement at 2pm EST Wednesday make sure to watch for this.  As seen in the chart above 97% of investors are confident there will be a 25bp rate hike.  A couple of weeks ago I was confident the Fed would mention a 50bp hike in their testimony in front of Congress, it was mentioned but not talked about as much as I thought.  While many people think they need to do a 50bp rate hike they only think the Fed will do a 25bp rate hike since anything major could cause the markets to crash.  I want there to be a 50bp rate hike but the chance of this actually happening is minimal.  A 25bp rate hike is almost guaranteed here so no crazy volatility unless they decide to do a 50bp rate hike... If they do a 50bp rate hike then yeah: everything will crash.\n\nMany investors will watch bad news and do more in depth research so I am expecting Monday to be bearish, I bought UVXY Thursday and Friday and am holding over the weekend.  Tuesday the selling pressure will settle and buyers will probably take control.  Wednesday though, the rate hike decision will be watched very closely, I am not expecting the market to be green if they announce a 25bp hike.  There is really nothing bullish about that, the short term economy is just being propped up at the expense of the long term economy, more people are starting to realize that now.  Thursday and Friday the selling pressure will continue unless some peace treaty is made by Russia, this is unlikely though, Putin does not want to give up.  This Friday is the third Friday of the month and it will be a \\*quad witching event\\* basically lots of futures and options contracts expire and the market will pullback in anticipation for this; it will be a very volatile day.  \n\n \\* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more \n\n \n\n**TLDR**\n\nMonday🐻Tuesday🐂Wednesday🐻(⬛🦢if 50bp)Thursday🐻Friday 🐻, Support\\~409, Be ready for Wednesday!\n\n**I will respond to every comment!**"), ('2008 Called again.

"If you look at certain parts of any charts they look like other charts so shut your face."\n\nI thought you could use another opportunity to get angry. \n\nCome at me, bro! Vent for daddi. Show me on the doll where the stock market touched you.\n\nAnd stop buying the fucking dip unless you\'re on some short term trading shit. We aren\'t in tendies town yet.\n\nLike my uncle always said when I asked why I had to take off my pants, "We\'re not at the bottom yet."'), ('This is How the (Financial) World Ends', 'This is How the (Financial) World EndsSo, this week, we saw the start of the total collapse of the modern financial system and the end of the Bretton Woods era of international monetary policy.\n\nBold claim, yeah baby?  You\'re probably thinking this has to do with the war in Ukraine or something, right? Well, it does a little bit, but mostly it has to do with what happened with RSX and LME this week, and a little bit with what happened with Rivian.\n\n**TLDR: Wall Street, China, and Russia are all broke and shit is going to get real over the next few months.  Or, to put it another way, some dude named Noah moved next door and started building a boat in his backyard, and you\'re just beginning to feel some raindrops.**\n\nLet\'s start with the biggest shitshow out there, the London Metals Exchange, or LME.  A fair number of people are comparing what happened with LME and Nickel to what happened when Apex Clearing turned off the buy button for the meme stocks back in January of 2021.  And yes, I meant Apex Clearinghouse, not Robinhood you twits, Apex made RH do it, and a dozen other brokers as well.  Vlad was just a fall guy, and not the cool kind that was on TV back in the \'80s.\n\nWhat the LME did can be split into two parts: \n\n1) they had a massive short squeeze that was fucking up prices, amplified by uncertainty from the war in Ukraine, so they completely halted trading.  This is entirely normal.  It\'s happened dozens of times in the 144 years they\'ve been open.  Complete trading halts occur in all exchanges whenever shit starts getting fucked up.  For example, US markets were shut down for a week after 9/11.\n\n2) they fucking canceled 12 hours worth of completed trades.  This is the part that should get your knickers in a twist if you were actually wearing any.   \n\nNow, I know a lot of you are sitting there feeling smart thinking "I know why they did it! They\'re criminals and stealing!"  Well, you\'re right, but that\'s NOT why they canceled 12 hours of completed trades, just like Apex didn\'t turn off the meme buy button because they woke up and decided they really needed to use their broker apps to get their fuck on with retail in a big \'ol gang bang. \n\nNo, they did this for one reason and one reason only: survival.  They were dead.  LME let the Nickel market get so fucked up that they not only had to stop transactions, or unwind a couple at the end, they had to unwind 12 fucking hours worth of trading.  I mean, these people are so goddamned incompetent that they didn\'t even realize they\'d been shot in the head, skinned, and turned into a fucking rug for two whole shifts at Wendy\'s!\n\nUnderstand, they just set 144 years of skimming trades on fire.  It\'s not little guys buying FDs on the LME, it\'s big boys and industrial giants.  They all have lawyers and elected officials on retainer, and all of those clients are as done and gone as your made up Canadian girlfriend from grade school.\n\nI can\'t decide if the best part of all this is the cover story they put out, or how many dumbfucks didn\'t take three seconds to realize its bullshit.  The idea that Xiang Guangda just said "I don\'t want to pay the margin call" and then the LME was like, "ok, well, I guess that sucks to be us, guess we\'ll just pour all this gasoline on ourselves and play with matches" is so laughable I just got a hernia from ROFLing so hard.  Look, because I know you \'tards are all stuck on the shortbus trying to figure out what I\'m talking about, I\'ll just drive ya\'ll on over to the explanation:\n\nTsingshan (the company Xiang owns that has the short position) isn\'t some kind of nickel producer like the papers are saying.  They make steel.  They\'re the second largest (largest by revenue) steel making company in China.  You know what that steel is used for?  Construction.  Know who hasn\'t had enough money to make a bond payment in over six months now?  Every goddamned construction company and developer in China.  What, you think they\'re paying their fucking materials bills?  \n\nHere\'s a quote from the South China Morning Post attributed to Xiang:\n\n *“Foreigners have some activities going on \\[against Tsingshan’s position,\\] we are actively coordinating \\[to tackle the problem\\],” China Business News cited Xiang as saying in a report late on Tuesday. “We have received a lot of phone calls today – related government departments and leaders are very supportive to us. Tsingshan’s position, operation and management has no problems.”* \n\nAgain, because I know you can\'t read, here\'s a translation of that quote into a picture.\n\n[I specifically said there are no problems, so it\'s all okay!](https://preview.redd.it/e4shtzkzqwm81.jpg?width=1366&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19e41c0ca232b1309c0abd65f624d5e4f849183c)\n\nNow, why is it such a huge problem that Xiang has no money?  Well, if he can\'t make the margin call, the short position, much like a politician or anyone who\'s daddy donated a library to get them into Harvard, fails upwards.  First it goes up to Xiang\'s bank, which is also fucking broke.  Then it moves onto the LME itself, which again, doesn\'t have the fucking money.  So what does the LME do?  Same thing the mobsters in Goodfellas did when the restaurant was too broke to steal from anymore, they set everything on fire.  The reason the LME hasn\'t opened back up yet is because the short position is still there, and nobody who\'s responsible for that position has the money to cover it.\n\nNow, you might think, if you were smart instead of so dumb you went to Bangkok to get a TIE Fighter, why does this Xiang guy have such a large naked short position he can\'t cover?  The answer is simplicity itself - he\'s broke, so he naked shorted his own shit to get paid, then got fucked when it went sideways.  I mean, people here on WSB like to call themselves reckless degenerates, but lemme give you a full "trust me bro" on this one, ya\'ll ain\'t got shit on the stupid rich fucks that run the world.\n\nThat\'s part one.  What about part 2, RSX?  Well, as many people who lost money Friday can attest, some serious, serious fucking of Put options occurred.  Van Eck started to liquidate the RSX fund, but they didn\'t *say* they were liquidating it, so options couldn\'t settle as cash value.  But they ALSO halted trading of the ETF, so options couldn\'t be traded either.  And as a final piece of fuck you brokers weren\'t letting people borrow shares to even fucking exercise the put option themselves.  Wild yeah? (someone else wrote a very good DD on this exact thing this morning, I highly recommend you go read it - no link because automod hates me every time I put a link in my posts)\n\nThis is example number two of someone burning down the restaurant because they couldn\'t steal from it anymore.  Whatever MM sold those options didn\'t have enough to cover them, so this shit with Van Eck not stating the fund was liquidating happened.\n\nThat\'s strike two for all the market makers and exchanges being fucking broker than you when you\'ve gotta go behind the Taco Bell because Wendy\'s is too high class for your ass.  Let\'s see if we can a third K to finish them off.\n\nI give you Rivian, ticker RIVN, a truly shitty EV manufacturer, that like most of them can\'t actually make cars.  These guys are such a clown show that they tried to raise the prices on the pre-orders from the people who waited years to get one.  So they had earnings on 3/10, and it was just about as big of a disaster as you\'d expect.  Then, after hours, they dropped $6 bucks on nearly a million in volume.  Everyone who bought puts printed, right?  Nope.  The next day in pre-market, on less than a third of that volume, the price magically shot back up $5.5 bucks, completely wiping out everyone\'s puts.  By EOD the price had only dropped a total of $3 bucks from Thursday\'s close, and wouldn\'t you know it, the price of an ATM put option bought EOD on 3/10 was more than $3. I\'d recommend taking a look at the volume numbers and corresponding price movement of RIVN throughout the day on 3/11 and drawing your own conclusions.\n\nThis is like the, what, hundredth and a half time we\'ve seen this exact thing play out now?  It\'s not an accident.  More money is traded every day in the market on options than stocks themselves.  When the PFOF brokers that retail uses publicly refer to the MMs as "our clients", you know the fix is in.  What makes the RIVN bit so interesting is a) how obvious it is, and b) that they\'re doing this while under DOJ investigation for this exact fucking thing.  That tells me two things, 1) they don\'t think they\'ll actually be prosecuted - which, fair, they\'ve got a whole lot of history on their side for this one, and 2) they don\'t have a choice \'cause they\'re running out of money.\n\nAnd why, you may ask are they out of money?  Well, it\'s a mix of things.  1) all the attention from Reddit and the media and law enforcement has clients pulling money from Hedge Funds, leading to sell offs, which when you\'re leveraged at 137x, leads to a rapid collapse in your buying power. 2)  Russian assets aren\'t just in freefall anymore, they\'ve hit the ground and started drilling for oil.  3) remember where I was talking about China earlier?  Yeah, their shit is worth even less than the Russian stuff, but thanks to Xi\'s brilliant leadership plan, people haven\'t realized that yet.  Below, I have obtained exclusive photo evidence from some of my old SF buddies of Xi and his top councilor enacting their plan to save China\'s economy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[If we can\'t see the lines go down, then are they really dropping?](https://preview.redd.it/r254e9n2rzm81.jpg?width=444&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e27e89a6f0629808f8be2f7557a8aa35d6dbcf8a)\n\nAs always, the official info coming out of China is a mix of fantasy, lies, and flat out ignorance, spiced up by a heaping helping of corrupt incompetence.  Because Xi is a tinpot wannabe dictator with delusions of Imperial grandeur, he wanted to make sure that while he was hosting the Olympics everything went off without a hitch, so he told all the companies and rich people in China to make like autists and buy the fucking dip in the equities and bond markets.\n\nBecause all those folks didn\'t want to get executed by anti-aircraft guns while their families went to the organ donor farms, they did.  Which in this case, means throwing good money after very very very bad money.  It\'s honestly difficult to describe just how badly China has sabotaged itself.  I\'m sure you all know by now about the ghost cities made up of structurally unsound buildings with no interiors, and in some cases no exterior walls.  But, do you also know about all the railways to nowhere that aren\'t being serviced or maintained?  Do you also know how many MORE shitty tofu-dreg buildings have been paid for by citizens\' life savings that aren\'t yet built?  Spoiler, it\'s a lot.\n\nMeanwhile, the property market in China is in free fall.  Here\'s a chart of official chinese statistics on the price of housing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Taken directly from the National Bureau of Statistics of China](https://preview.redd.it/dskl8tmog0n81.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98f46d6498440cde7e703d5b55041ec38c6db306)\n\nNow, these prices all reflect worthless tofu-dreg empty apartments that exist only to sell to the next sucker/investor.  Notice that trend line?  Anyone know what happens when that price increase gets closer to zero?  As our friend Lelu from the 5th Element would say "bada bing boom!".  For another reference, look at the Dutch tulip market after it popped.  Remember, these are the official Chinese govt numbers.  I\'m guessing the actual numbers have gone negative already.\n\nWestern banks, particularly up in Canada, are extremely exposed to the bonds these empty shell apartments are backing.  Western banks, again particularly up in Canada, are also heavily exposed to the commercial and residential real estate markets.  Both of which are in massive fucking bubbles funded in large part by money from Wall Street, Russia, and China.  Guess which of those are now broke (hint: it\'s all three of them).  CMBS notes started going bad this month - there\'s a reason all the politicians all of a sudden decided we needed to be back in the office, and the mortgage missed payment rate is skyrocketing faster than the price of oil.  I have not yet been able to figure out if the spike in missed mortgage payments is banks/wall street failing to pay on all the properties they\'ve accumulated, if it\'s all the missing repossessions from the pandemic finally showing up, or if it\'s a leading indicator of a new crisis.\n\nI don\'t know how much longer the powers-that-be can keep these balls in the air, but it\'s not much longer.  Assuming Russia follows their playbook from the disaster they had in Grozny in \'94/\'95, we\'re about to see the major cities in Ukraine get leveled by heavy artillery and rocket attacks.  Which means you can pretty much kiss the Ukrainian wheat harvest goodbye, because all the infrastructure needed to support it will be rubble, along with the roads and bridges you\'d need to get it out of the country.  Couple that with what looks to be bad wheat harvests in the US and China barring some big weather pattern shifts, and we\'re going to see some massive price spikes in the price of bread and other food this summer.  Expensive food = political instability and riots.\n\nThe US will see a fresh round of "race riots" sparked by random online videos that are really about inflation and economic inequality, but the media and politicians will go full hog on the race angle, and people will buy it - if you need proof the general population is that gullible, look at how many think the Ukraine war is responsible for inflation and gas prices.  South Africa and Turkey, plus an unkown number of Middle Eastern countries will see Syrian civil war/Arab Spring type uprisings - remember, the Tunisian revolt started as a protest about the price of bread.\n\nFinally, since this is already way, way, way too long for any of you to actually read through, much less comprehend, I\'ll cut the part about Bretton Woods and the dollar as the international currency super short - there used to be one global financial system that was set up after WWII in a conference at Bretton Woods, hence the name.  By kicking Russia out of it, we forced the creation of a competing global economic system.  Which will likely be headed by China.  That pretty much guarantees another world war down the road, but hopefully not for a decade or two if we\'re really lucky.\n\nBecause I know my people, here are some tickers to throw money at if you want, I have extremely tiny positions (like one share in a couple of these) in all of them: long WEAT, SOYB, CORN, USO, YANG, short TUR, short EZA, short SPY/QQQ/DOW, long GME.  Oh, and I also just bought a Lincoln, because in addition to chips, the automakers are about to be short on metals too, and somehow a car counts as a fucking growth investment these days.\n\nIf I had the money to do so, I\'d also buy farmland with wind turbines and/or solar on it.  Real assets are about to be king, especially food and energy, which are the definition of real assets with inelastic demand.\n\nI\'ll be honest, the vast majority of my portfolio - over 90%, is in direct registered shares of GME, with a couple shares of AMC because fuck \'em, that\'s why.  I think at least a couple of brokers are going to detonate like we\'re seeing with the LME and fuckery like what happened with RSX will become more regular.  Whenever I have a big gain, I pull most of it out and buy more memes and then DRS them.\n\nThat IS financial advice by the way, but you probably shouldn\'t follow it.'), ('Meta Down 50%, in the last 6 months.', 'Meta Down 50%, in the last 6 months.'), ('3/11/22 Weekly SPY Analysis', '3/11/22 Weekly SPY AnalysisWell today was quite the exciting day if you ask me! \n\nAfter many saw that pre-market spike to 433.22 they thought we for sure had a green day secured in the bag. Only thing was the markets had something else planned that many did not expect and those who played the market as it lies were rewarded greatly! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/son0vjqcavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc65e2a536cdfa6da3ca839b3e377686f99c4d7\n\nWhen I look at this chart I actually see the STRONGEST put signal from 0815am this morning all the way until right now as market is closing. The crazy thing that if you were to block all the white noise, all the Biden speech pumps, all the Russia bs, all the pumps and dumps intraday and you looked at this chart here. You would see that in almost 14 hours of trading there was only ONE 15 minute candle closed above the 8 ema. That is some hella bearish movement. You could have entered a put at market open and not touched it till end of day and easily made 100-200% gains on your puts. However, of course intraday we have so much going on we can not be so objective. \n\nTechnical wise today had you just watch the 8 ema you would have been sitting pretty. But of course we have the classic sell off as Biden speaks followed by a big rally which we saw attempt to happen two times today. We also saw the VIX peak near 30.4 at 955am this morning and continue to fall as SPY continued to fall, which was interesting to watch. However, we saw around 240pm the VIX go on a massive fear run breaking its 8 ema and peaking at 31.04 before market closed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zu6t15tdavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9721c49c51293f43bc48b26eb1754aeb0aa99fe8\n\n if you follow me and were in the live chat today intraday around noon I mentioned SPY was testing its upward channel support and that if it broke the 424 support we would be breaking the channel and should see a big run down which can to happen exactly as I had mentioned. That’s why watching not only intraday but daily trends is so important. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/es3skajfavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4637043c677b12d440eac3e4c580a7926fb496f3\n\n Which leaves us with this very nice looking bear channel that I also mentioned to keep an eye on. We have officially hit the upper resistance with that pre-market move to 433 and now naturally it makes sense to see it test the support line which puts SPY next week testing support levels between 400 and 410. If you remember last time SPY hit its new lower low of 410 it immediately sky rocketed back up… we very well may see some of that same movement happen next week.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnix2xigavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aad74cba66f0f82571a4740043329461c42c893e\n\nAs mentioned this morning and intraday in the live what does this chart show you? Does it show you a bull chart or a massive bear chart? We are 100% without a doubt in a bear market. Even CNBC said we are super close to triggering their “extreme bear market” indicator that hasn’t hit since 2008 I guess. \n\nTodays intraday movement and this daily candle finish was very important to me and very foretelling for what is going to happen next week. We have a bearish engulfing candle on the daily, we once again after breaking the daily 8 ema failed to close the candle above it. Looking at the EMAs the daily 8 and daily 20ema are damn near falling straight vertical down now we have such a bearish sentiment on the chart. The daily 50 ema closed in even closed to the daily 200 ema leaving only $3.5 left before the death cross happens… We could see this death cross play out as early as Friday next week if we see some similar movement as this week and fail to make any significant upward movement. \n\nIf you remember next week we have the oh so awaited first rate hike and FOMC meeting on Wednesday. It is going to be VERY interesting to see not only what JPOW has to say but what he chooses to do with the rate hike. Remember Thursday markets despite expected CPI did not like it and sold off still. I think next week we are going to see some fireworks on Wednesday and Thursday. IF I was a betting man its going to be the same thing as last week on Wednesday when JPOW testified we saw a fuck you green day followed by 4 very red days. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nThis was not my best week but overall a good week.

This ratio indicates how much investors in the S&amp;P 500 today are paying for shares compared to the total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 adjusted for inflation. \n\nAs you can see from the chart CAPE is moderately successful indicator of an over-valued market. Historically the Shiller CAPE index spends relatively little time above 25. It is currently around 34, the second highest price to earnings ratio since the [dot.com](https://dot.com) bubble.

Anyone watching and trading this morning saw the massive red candle come in breaking all the supports only to magically have the exchanges “freeze” and brokerages across the markets freeze and magically SPY goes on a nice bull run. \n\nBut atlas no matter the tricks and fuckery whoever was trying to play it was not enough and we still saw another afternoon of selling. Despite the clear red day we did see the bulls end of day save this from getting anymore bloodier than it really could have if it had free rain. \n\nVolume today was another very interesting thing I have been watching for a few weeks. Overall the volume on the day was around 95 million total which is still about 25 mil lower than usual. The last three trading days of SPY have all been below 100mil when the average is up around 120 mil currently. \n\nIt appears China today announced that they are going on some lockdowns for a new? Covid variant which is about the only explanation I have for why VIX opened near 31 dipped to a low of 30 around market open only to go on an absolute tear up to its peak of 33 around 245pm when we saw the bulls finally take some control. It will be interesting to see how the markets react to this throughout the week.\n\nTomorrow we have the first day of FOMC meeting, however, as far as I can tell (outside of leaks) there will be no information released until 2pm on WEDNESDAY. Tomorrow is the first day of the “meeting” from what I understand but markets should not get any news. Currentlly the first rate hike is scheduled to be released at 2pm Wednesday.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0f0bm9kc2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122e09056cbf1c9627dad6e8ad7843e3b9aa0826\n\nWhat do you see when you looked at this? I see an overall big bear channel down with some intra-levels but they are all going down. This leaves room for us to trade up or down depending on the day. However, the overall trend continues since January to be downward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jfrdj1jd2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f52f792738300375b5e7715adb8703898e670f51\n\nTomorrow my expected range if we have a bullish day would be to “level up” near 422-423. IF SPY can get above that 423 mark it could continue to the next “level up” around 428-430. \n\nHowever, If SPY has another red day tomorrow the next level down is 405 to 408. If that level fails we will finally breach into the upper 300s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ix6pbce2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c357daf0e592f9d8f1ced2a0b820ae5e73d20758\n\nThe futures show a similar trend line. Its major support is near 4082. If it can break above 4176 over night it could see a nice gap up. However a rejection at the last diagonal dotted resistance line could result in quiet the bearish move tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58qg4uif2gn81.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=814c28bb8482a52e72f70fbea86dc2c1a5ae1fb2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvn8e72g2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4603fb9582caa2d05b09ea40b1820435e9bc612\n\nOn the daily chart the first picture I highly two important candles and then the next pic is unaltered to allow you to see it more clearly… what do you see here? I see two nearly identical candles and see a double bottom. Its not perfect double bottom but for a daily chart 3/8= 415.12 and today a low of 415.79… well that’s a pretty dang close double bottom to me. It almost reminds me of the inverse of the two green double top candles from February 2nd and 9th. \n\nWhat do I think that means? Well personaly with that long upper wic from the morning I would NOT be surprised to see a nice gap up for futures over night and/ or a green day tomorrow. My anticipation also will be the markets running up SPY tomorrow in anticipation of FOMC being good and only a 0.25bps rate hike. I feel like lately markets love to run this up end of the day. We also finished above the midchannel support line today too, however, continuing to wic above the daily 8 ema but finishing BELOW it really is a very bearish sign. The 8 and 20 EMA are darn near 30 degree angles straight down and the 50 ema is now only $3 from the 200 EMA to complete the allusive death cross. \n\nFor bulls to get a leg up tomorrow we need to see Futures hold its green over night and we need to see the VIX continue its end of the day sell off and breach 31 and inevitably 30. At this range a nice unwinding of the VIX would lead to a very green day. Its very possible tomorrow is green. I don’t know about 3% green but it very well could be nice and green. \n\nBears need to see futures lose its current green, the vix continue back up near 33 and break this double bottom at 415. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\nUnfortunately got burnt by the market wise freeze of exchanges this morning so took a pretty big hit there. Thankfully I had only risked about 20% of my normal allotted per option amount. After that I decided to stay with my 20% of my allotted amount and I also continued to test a new indicator out. Overall still learning how it ticks but overall I am a fan. I also have no idea what happened to my TOS at the end of the day (even TOS help desk says they didn’t see it on their side) but around 3pm I was in a call. I watched on my TOS desktop a put open up randomly. My call then close out red before my eyes and the put then close out before my eyes red too. I asked TOS about it and they didn’t really have much to see about it. I have no idea what happened and have no explanation for it and neither did they. The only thing I noticed is the 15min candle had a massive quick dip and recovery at the same time. Overall not a fan. But none the less made 10 trades for 50% green and 50% red. For a total gain of 1% and a small loss. I do really need to get back to my normal one trade a day and now that I feel a little more comfortable with this new indicator I will continue to watch it. I got too cocky with it today for sure and over traded my gains away at the end of the day which is a cardinal sin. But overall tomorrow is a new day! \n\nI will take a small loss (which really my put was up 15% before exchanges froze this morning and ended up closing it down around 20% by time TOS “adjusted it” for me and the fanthom put I didn’t even enter along with the call randomly closing out for me (and no im not on margin) overall not a bad day today).

RIP your SPY calls'), ("Why the market is likely to trade lower in May and how I'm playing it.", "Why the market is likely to trade lower in May and how I'm playing it.It is widely expected that the fed will start a series of rate hikes this year starting with a 25 BPS rate hike during the March 15-16th FOMC meeting (today and tomorrow).  This is significant because the market has been used to 0% interest rates for quite a while now.  In fact, whenever the fed initiates a series of rate hikes after a long period of flat rates (meaning the rates were not changed for a while), the market *always* reacts negatively and traded lower two months after the first rate hike as it adjusts to the idea of a period of increasing interest rates. There are three dates where this has happened; namely Feb 1994, July 2004, and Dec 2015. Here's a chart I made showing how SPY reacted in each of those cases: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wuqppie0jjn81.png?width=3969&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89824fb62ed3b26e265beed9e76a6c306b3d3abe\n\nThe idea here is that May's market (which will be used to a period of increasing interest rates) will be much less speculative than today's market (which was used to flat rates).  So most likely there will be a correction with the dip being sometime in May (this is what's always happened historically at least).   \n Biotech stocks are particularly vulnerable to increasing interest rates since they are extremely speculative and are highly dependent on borrowed money.  Here's what happened to XBI after the Dec 15 2015 FOMC event:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dtux8ykfljn81.png?width=1743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e750674d85d75f0529e9e57adf1b882fb753876\n\nAs you can see, it actually pumped a bit for the rest of the month, but the following two months it dumped very hard as biotech stocks were starting to feel the effects of increasing interest rates.  With all of that said, here are two plays that I plan on doing that I think you should consider:\n\n1. If XBI happens to rally the rest of the month after the March 15-16th FOMC like it did last time, I'm going to load up on puts at the end of the month set to expire in April and May.\n2. In each of those dates I listed above, it always bottomed out roughly two months after the first rate hike and then begins to correct from there. Thus, I plan on having plenty of cash to buy the dip in May/June as the market begins to correct.\n\nNote that I'm only playing (1) if XBI happens to rally the rest of the month (like it did last time).  My guess is that there will be a slight relief rally after the FOMC event happens, and then it will then dump next month as biotech stocks start to feel the effects of increasing interest rates.  You also don't need to play XBI like I'm doing; instead you could buy puts on anything that's very speculative and is highly dependent on borrowed money (even SPY works).  If you aren't used to options, then don't do (1), and instead focus on (2).  You can still make a lot of money by buying the correction dip later this year."), ('Slow, Steady Decline?', "Slow, Steady Decline?I am the born optimist.

If the war goes on for longer, it might well be more. \n\nI can't imagine this will not impact the markets, particularly as I am heavily invested in more volatile shares (TSLA, NVDA, AMD, QQQ, AMZN, GOOGL to name a few). I also have a Lombard account, which is on the safe side for now, but you never know how things go. \n\nI have made some (limited) adjustments to my portfolio meant to reduce my Lombard. I am now in a situation where I would risk a margin call only if things were to go massively tits up (as in, say,: Nasdaq minus 60% or 70%, or a combination of Nasdaq minus 50% and S&amp;P minus 50%). I am using this as a proxy of general shares decline, if the indices go down badly there's is no way TSLA or NVDA will escape the carnage, though they made fare... less badly (or not, as the case may be). \n\nI know this is, realistically, unlikely, which is why I sleep at night. But I would like to know what your opinion are on a slow, steady, protracted decline like the one in the years 1929 to 1931 (which was way more brutal than the October 1929 crash). I am particularly interested in the risk approach of those who already have a Lombard account and must, I think, make the same considerations I am making. \n\nThanks to all retards in advance"), ('900 To 24 AMD shares and Cash', '900 To 24 AMD shares and Cash'), ('Loss porn on NVDA calls', 'Loss porn on NVDA calls'), ('Robinhood stealing from the poor and giving to the rich (Call Debit Spread)', 'Robinhood stealing from the poor and giving to the rich (Call Debit Spread)I bought a call debit spread on SPY.\nBought a $413 call at $16.00\nSold a $414 call at $15.05\n\nThis cost me $95 per contract with the expectation that it would be worth $100 at expiration it the price was above $414\n\nAt 3:00 the price was at $416.38 and at close it was at $416.98.

Either way, massive moves incoming, beginning this or next week. A few charts help visualize this.**\n\nOK, so here is a useful nugget of technical analysis on S&amp;P500 that should shed some light on what is about to happen next...\n\nUnless you\'ve been living under the icesheet of Europa, you should be well aware by now that this market... all of it, across the planet, although it\'s the US we\'re concerned with here... is heading for a "Day After Tomorrow", Tsunami-sized crash and depression that hasn\'t been seen since 1929. The only real question right now, is:\n\nIs this it? Has this downturn marked the peak and were standing on the edge of the cliff, our center of gravity already leaning over? or is there still a last bump, a final ramp, to this madness, before it all collapses like a wet sandcastle?\n\nTime will tell, but for speculation purposes, there are some neat technical indicators we might like to take a look at if we decide to speculate the moves to come.\n\nI will use three S&amp;P500 E-Mini Futures charts to illustrate this.\n\nOf note, is the simplicity of the charts to follow. The best chart work is simple and suggestive, not some convoluted overlap of schizoid drawings which could be mistaken for attempts to invoke some esotheric spirits.\n\nTo that end, the features of interest in these charts are as follows:\n\n• 2 × Fibonacci Extentions, different scales\n\n• Quad Witching Dates\n\n• Death Cross\n\n• Main Trendlines of this cycle\n\n• 3-Standard-Deviation Bollinger Bands (they just sit there)\n\nChart 1 - Trendlines: [IMAGE](https://i.ibb.co/0hsXYXV/20220314-225401.png)\n\nYou\'ll notice the 3 trendlines originate at the origin points of the main bull markets of the last decade. This  nested fractal-like feature is pretty common with bull runs, on any scale. As the length of the runs compresses, their amplitude increases.\n\nYou\'ll also notice a big Fibonacci going from the \'07 peak, which is almost the same as the \'00 peak, to the \'09 trough. Bull runs love to peak around the x.618 or x.236 extensions, where \'x\' is usually between 1 and 5, and this market seems to be no exception, after pinball-ing through all key levels.\n\nNOTE: The 4 main trendlines neatly converge to a point. Also, the point coincides with the 5.236 retracement.\n\nChart 2: [IMAGE](https://i.ibb.co/0hsXYXV/20220314-225401.png)\n\nThe Fibonacci in "Chart 1" goes from the Feb2020 peak to the Mar2020 trough, and follows the ensuing run as it plays pinball against the key levels on to new highs. \n\nFor those still unaware of the meaning of a Quad Witching, it is when a bunch of option expiration dates overlap, spawning all sorts of complexities and ramifications. They affect volatility and often price too.\n\nNOTE: The current downturn has found support on the 1.618 extension level. The 2.618 level also coincides with the intersection of the main trendlines, just like the 5.236 in the other chart.\n\nChart 3: [IMAGE](https://i.ibb.co/G7fSVNN/20220314-221834.png)\n\nThis chart is a close-up of the first one. Upon this closer inspection, you can see the current All-Time-High neatly hitting the 4.618 level, which is one of the most popular peak levels for fractal bull runs like this one.\n\nYou can also see, the dreaded "Death Cross" forming. That is, the 50-Day Moving Average piercing the 200DMA to the downside. Now... here\'s the deal with these crosses. They can be fakeouts, from both sides. When a market is indecided such as this one, and the cross is young, it can flip back around and continue what it was doing before. This could be one of those times, or it could be a glaring signal that this bread is toast.\n\nNOTE: Current peak at 4.618, a still-young Death-Cross, 5.236 Fib level matches trendline convergence.\n\nAnd finally, the FOMC meeting is about to happen not far from Friday\'s Quad-Witching.\n\nThere are so many stars aligned here, it\'s a Conga Line of stars. Clearly, there is a massive amount of pent up energy in this market... with an upcoming Quad-Witching and an FOMC meeting, after 2 months of bouncing into a descending wedge, with the 50DMA having just touched the 200DMA... there are 2 main directions this can go:\n\nDOWN - the 4.618 Fib was the peak, the market never retests that trendline and it all collapses at breakneck speed. Your DOOM Puts will finally pay if you cash them right and you\'ve witnessed the beginning of the end.\n\nUP - after FOMC/QuadWithcing, the market does one last quick and furious run towards the 5.236/2.618/Trendline-Convergence area, a.k.a "The Moon", with some bounces along the way at key levels, and while it might not hit it exactly, it would be a ramp to behold... before detaching it\'s boosters, hovering for a moment followed by a fiery re-entry and ballistic fall: see the "DOWN" paragraph above.\n\nWhichever way it goes, a lot is pointing towards it going big. If you buy option strategies to take advantage of the big move, regardless of direction, you might make big bucks on the fall, or pretty good bucks on the rise. And if it goes up, then you can quite confidently put it all in DOOM strategies, since the only way from there is down, and that should pay even bigger bucks.\n\nThis post by no means covers the "whole" picture.

Well, check out Wallbox, a potential "sleeper" in a rapidly growing industry.I am too lazy to write a detailed analysis and WSB is not famous for its long attention span, so I would keep this DD quite short (but maybe not for the WSB standard). If the company gets your attention, do your own research. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all know that EV\'s being the future of transportation is almost a sure thing and we all have heard the cliche " the people that made the most money during the gold rush, were the ones that were selling shovels".  Investing in a company that makes charging stations, looks like a good bet for the investors that have higher risk tolerance. I would like to introduce you to a company, that I think has very good potential, but is still staying under the radar, probably due to the fact that it is based in Europe. That company is Wallbox (WBX) . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWallbox is a company that is specialised in offering smart charging stations for home use. That might be "smart", cuz the public space is way more crowded and their potential competitors there are very well-funded and bigger. You will still get exposure to this subsector by buying WBX, but I will talk about this later. Wallbox products have a lot of features. They allow you to control your charger remotely so you can schedule charging sessions to benefit from off-peak energy rates, monitor your charger status, and more through the Wallbox app. Also, their as they call it "proprietary bidirectional technology" allows you to charge and discharge your EV, converting it into an energy storage unit that can replace or add capacity to a home battery. Their best selling product Quasar, is the the world’s lightest and smallest DC charger and supports facial recognition and gesture control. Last, but not least, their products are very aesthetically pleasing and that might be more important than you think. For a rather small company, they have a very dedicated fan base. One of the main things that distinguishes great companies from the others is that the future industry leaders are able to create a very big brand loyalty and even if they are at the early stage of its development, you can see that people love their work and it is only about time till they expand further. It is no wonder that Quasar was one of the best selling AMZN products last year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWallbox are also selling products for business use and their idea is for the companies to be able to use their electric fleet as a power grid for their storage spaces or office buildings. Furthermore, they just announced their public space charging station - Supernova, that offers 50 percent cost reduction and very fast charging (15 min. for a charge). Its revolutionary design allows for a no cost power boost and also comes with advanced software and touchscreen. Wallbox are definitely entering this segment a bit late, but as an investor it is nice to have exposure all of the subsectors in the EV charging business. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, let\'s take a look at their financials. Wallbox has a very manageable debt that is a bit more than its yearly revenue, lower P/S than all of its major competitors and  the biggest operating margins in the industry. Their revenue growth for the year is over 250%.  They also have the backing of the spanish energy giant  Iberdrola. The company is well-diversified and sells in more than 100 countries. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Of course this is not a financial advice.

Unwilling to accept short term pain in order to get rid of Russia. That's why EU sanctions have hit a ceiling. They need to be pushed.\n\nRussia: Will not stop until they either take Ukraine or Putin is toppled. Dictators rarely fall from the outside, hence the sanctions. There's at least one bank left out of sanctions, so Putin and the oligarchs are ok. Hence the West's huge aid to Ukraine, to allow it to keep fighting while the sanctions take effect.\n\nUkraine's image management is too sophisticated, so it's obvious they are getting a ton of help from foreign intelligence services.\n\nThey suddenly took quite a turn with their 'negotiations' with Russia. For some bizarre reason the Ukrainians keep spinning the negotiations as positive, constructive, working towards a ceasefire etc. Zelensky himself keeps hinting of giving in to Russia's official demands. It all feels as if they are about to sign a peace treaty, yet they keep asking for guns and to close the skies. Something's fishy.\n\n**My theory is this:** \n\nUSA is dead-set on using Ukraine to get rid of Russia. However, EU is now stalling and USA is realizing that Ukraine will lose without further hardcore support. \n\nI suspect the British (their intelligence services are just the best) are advising Ukraine to pretend that it's leaning close to accepting Russia's demands, hence all the positive spin on negotiations. This is lighting a fire on USAs backside to do more, faster. It needs to push EU to join the complete ban of energy/trade. This is why Biden is coming to EU next week. This is why the bordering countries to Ukraine went to visit today and started muttering things about a 'peace force' moving into Ukraine from EU to oversee things. \n\nCoincidentally, Republicans+Democrats are pushing a motion through senate to ban all Russian banks, which would forbid every country in the world from giving Russia a single dollar. This is targeting China and Germany/Italy. They want to use this as a stick when Biden goes to EU next week to push EU to do more. \n\nUSA has already stopped energy imports from Russia and banned all trade. USA has nothing to lose by banning the remaining Russian banks and using its force to push its allies to do more, willingly or not. If China breaks the sanctions it will give USA the perfect excuse to apply penalties to them as well. \n\nI foresee a complete ban of energy trade with Russia. Military intervention from NATO or a 'peace keeping force' that will act as bait to give pretext to NATO going in is also a good bet. They will not get rid of Putin without military intervention or insane financial pressure. \n\nI do not see this ending with Ukraine signing half the country away in a peace treaty. This is too good of a chance for USA to let it go. Things will only escalate further.\n\nPositions: SPY puts, MOS, USO, WEAT (I know it's not 'the' wheat we want but futures cost $50k and it behaves similarly)"), ('Bought SPY options at the bottom.

Today we see that statistics are not always correct and why we have to put our biases behind us and focus on what the intraday chart shows us. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t29y4wywd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fe03fe32bd95699cd83928143af59bb99b1163e\n\nLooking at this intraday chart you can see that as soon as market opened the bulls came out swinging and they never really let off the throttle till market closes. Looking at the chart now you can clearly see that bulls broke out, rejected the important 437 resistance, regained steam and then blasted through resistance to new highs. I wasn’t trading most of the day but I like many got burnt thinking the morning rip was the fake out and that we would sell off the rest of the day. Statistically speaking more times than not we would have been correct. Also it really didn’t seem like it wanted to break through that oh so important 437 resistance. \n\nBulls managed to brake this all the way to 441.07 to close here out today for a modest 1.25% gain. However, after hours saw an immediate sell off and is currently sitting between -0.55 to -0.6% right now and using the 8 ema as resistance instead of support. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmhvdfcyd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c11447d825a6cdb86d84ff82de06da5e359f2d\n\nLooking at my daily chart I can clearly see it is time to make a new channel and see if we can predict where spy is going to go next! Overall the way yesterdays candle finished as a hanging man I am beyond impressed the bulls pushed it green today. Interestingly enough today is technically a hanging man candle also. However, when I look at January 28th, 31st, February 1st and 2nd we actually are seeing a very similar setup today to that. That was the last time there was more than 3 consecutive green candles in a row in over 3 months. Today marks only the second time since December 21st that SPY has managed to have three green days in a row. \n\nIt is also noted that SPY has NOT closed a candle ABOVE the daily 50 ema since February 9th and has only closed one above it (including today) 3 times in over two months. \n\nThis is also the first FULL candle closed ABOVE the daily 20 ema since February 9th and before that it was on January 4th.\n\nNow let me show you a few things I am watching for and seeing on this daily chart as we actually have a few different setups forming. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1nhvmvzd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57521c5ea38ad089f76e609166469e79a1b1aa8d\n\nFirst up we have this green channel here which COULD be the start of the bull run… This channel allows us to move as high as the daily 100 ema before we would see much resistance which is around 445 currently. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lixzmov0e1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac86c49e56b8d49e652298c545a7675507100d0\n\nNext we have the red bear market channel. This channel would allow SPY to gap up as high as 445-446 (right around the daily 100 EMA also) before it would see any real resistance. \n\nNow one other thing that I notice looking at todays chart and why its actually very peculiar to me that we hit 441 intraday and rejected so hard downward after hours is that the previous highest high before today was also right at 441. We are currently seeing a double double top at 441 that would if it holds send us crashing back down. Interestingly enough we also have a double bottom near 415. Which if this plays out correctly we could be seeing the following movements to confirm a massive inverse head and shoulder pattern…\n\n 410 \uf0e0 441 \uf0e0 415 \uf0e0 441 \uf0e0 410?\n\nIf we continue to sell off it would be very interesting if we were to retest 410 from this level if bulls fail to regain strength. This pattern actually played out the exact same back in January/ February. 420 \uf0e0 458 \uf0e0 444 \uf0e0 458 \uf0e0 410. \n\nHistory is not predictive of the future. However, it would be quite amazing to see one month+ longer inverse head and shoulders pattern lead right into another. Overall If spy fails to break higher than 441 tomorrow or beginning of next week I would be watching for the retest of 410 before we go any higher. However, if we manage to get a candle closed at or above 445 I am going to be convinced the bull run is back on (for now). \n\nI am also watching for the possibility of a future 441 double top too. Currently on that path spy is on if it were to dip into next week but effectively trade sideways (much like it did end of January for its double top) we could beginning of April see a triple top at 441 that would surely cause quite the downside. We definitely have some big levels to watch out for tomorrow and next week. \n\nTomorrow is the quad witching day which historically in a BULL market results in a usually pretty red day. However, in a bear market im not quite sure what to expect. Chart wise I would be pretty impressed with a 4th red day but the fact that Mondays low was 415.79 and we closed today at 441.07 means that SPY from Mondays low to todays high has gone up over 5.9%. That is an absolute massive gain for one week. Especially when you factor in that spy up until today had not closed back to back green candles in over a month. But for reference the last time SPY had 4 back to back days of green in a row end of January/ beginning of February spy managed to gain over 7.1% in 4 days. \n\nThe one thing we can guaranteed is that we do not know exactly what the market is going to do and we can only be along for the ride. Many of you probably are thinking its time to enter puts because surely its going to go back down. But the one thing we have to remember is that stocks historically go up not down. So in the end as much as this is clearly a bear market we are in… in the end we are fighting the overall bigger bull trend. \n\nI am staring at this chart looking for confirmation one way or the other and honestly I cant say I have any. If we break 445 I think that is a bigger signal we are back for the bull run but if we were to get back under 420 range I would think we see 400 before we see 460. In the end today was a massive break for the bulls BUT if you remember back to January. February when we had the massive “V” recovery from 420 the channel resistance we were in broke yet we continued lower. Again history doesn’t repeat itself but I am seeing quite a few bear case scenarios vs bull scenarios right now. \n\nThe best thing the bulls do have going for them though is that the VIX is still historically higher than usual sitting at 26. Most of the “fear” around FOMC, rate hikes, war, inflation, etc. is truly (from the horses mouth JPOW himself) PRICED IN. So unless something wild and new happens we should see the VIX attempt to lower itself down into the teens again. The natural easing of fear and the VIX returning to its average below 20 should allow SPY to head back near 450-460s. \n\nI do ponder if we see a return to a short lived bull run before the next CPI, FOMC and Rate hike. \n\nThis weeks FOMC minutes release on April 7th. And the next FOMC meeting is April 27th. \n\nThe next CPI is not until April 12th\n\nWith all that bulls do have some freedom for the next few weeks to unleash the beast again. Tomororw will be an interesting day with the quad witching though but Monday should start the “new trend.” \n\nRemember- DM if you wanna keep getting these updates after April 2nd as they will no longer be posted to reddit.'), ('SPY may reach $500 by end of this year', 'SPY may reach $500 by end of this yearEven if this week was a bull trap and SPY goes back to $420 next week, as long as the war ends soon, it is possible for SPY to surge to $500 later this year. Ukraine war will be much more transitory compared to inflation. As long as there is no WW3, we can safely assume that the economic damage to US via sanctions will be small, and most of the negative effect is towards higher inflation due to higher oil price.\n\nHence, I think that the long-term main factor that decides whether the stock market will surge, flat, or fall is inflation and how the Fed\'s policy pans out to bring the inflation back to 2%. \n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed made it clear that there would be 7 rate hikes this year. This was different from their previous attitude where they chose not to tell how many rate hikes planned for next 2 to 3 years. This previous "indifferent" attitude resulted in uncertainties perceived by the market. Will the Fed increase the rate hike by 2% overnight? Will the Fed have 10+ rate hikes this year? Market hates uncertainties, and thus the initial crash before the war crash a month ago.\n\nAs the Fed now makes it clear how many rate hikes will be introduced in next 2 to 3 years, this sent the signal to the market that the Fed knows how to combat inflation (at least the market is more confident with the Fed now). Otherwise, the Fed will not tell us how many rate hikes to introduce. This also implies that recession is less likely to happen as the Fed now appears to know what they are doing compared to 2 months ago.\n\nInflation is not necessarily bad for stock market. Inflation means higher rates, which means higher profits for value stocks. Think companies like Walmart who can charge higher price for their goods. For most of growth stocks, it is not good due to reduced cash flow. However, for big tech companies like Apple and Amazon, they can also charge higher price for their products (iPhone, Prime membership fee), which neutralizes the effect. With the big tech companies constitute higher precentage of the stock market, this means that higher rates do not necessarily mean bad things to the stock market. Furthermore, many big tech companies have their own program of buying shares back, which serves as a catalyst of higher stock price in future. This is in addition to the fact that, in long-term, stock price will increase with inflation (if goods price increases, so should the stock price as long as the number of shares are around the same).\n\nTo sum up, it is likely that SPY will surge during later part of the year, and may even surpass $500 and reach $500. April can still be a bear month, but September, October, November and December are much more likely bull months.')], '2022-03-19': [('Lost it all mostly on spy options', 'Lost it all mostly on spy options'), ('WISH free delivery is matching and beating the prices of Amzn.

I think with the recent rally in mind we should review [THIS SQUEEZE METRICS PAPER](https://squeezemetrics.com/download/The_Implied_Order_Book.pdf) and talk about why we should look to btfd (buy the fucking dip) after these big down moves.  I\'m going to go page by page and try to explain the concepts inside it.  Before you read this post you will need to have a firm knowledge on what the options greeks are and why they are important.  I will try to explain some concepts but I might gloss over others.  If you want to learn more watch [this video about options greeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXZIW161ryI).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPage 1: \n\nThe paragraph starting with "options are best known for their non-linear payoff"\n\nDespite what the moron 19 year olds on this sub think, options market makers just fill orders that come through.  THAT IS BASICALLY IT.  Now lets say you are a big dog manager at an options market maker firm and you have a big ass portfolio filled with millions of options contracts.  What are you going to do to limit your risk?  Of course you have to do something, you can\'t just keep taking the other side of trades and hope you make money.  The trick is to hedge your options by buying or selling the underlying stock to make your position "neutral".   This is where delta comes in.  Delta is how much your option will increase if the underlying increases.  For example, if you own a 440 SPY call with 50 deltas then your call will go up 50 dollars if SPY goes up 1 dollar.  Thus if we want to neutralize our position then we need to short 50 shares.  This is because if SPY goes up one dollar from 440 to 441 then we gain 50 dollars from the call.  However, we lose 50 dollars from our short 50 shares position.  Hence we neither gained nor lost any money during this move (it\'s more complicated than this be we will talk about gamma and vanna later).  A rule of thumb to keep in mind is that you need to short as many shares as you have deltas to be flat delta.   Puts have negative delta because if the underlying goes up in price then you lose money.  If you want to hedge a put then you buy shares until you have 0 delta.  This is what the market makers do to ensure that they have minimal risk.  Their massive options protfolios are a jumbled mess of all kinds of complex options orders with crazy deltas and they have algos buying and shorting shares as appropriate to ensure that they are delta flat.  THIS CONSTANT BUYING AND SELLING FROM ROBOTS IS WHAT CAN INFLUENCE THE MARKET.  I, of course, do not claim that some nefarious algo is out there trying to shake you out of your dog shit 400 SPY puts that just got blown the fuck out of the water.  I simply claim that these robots must hedge their positions by trading the underlying so that their portfolios can survive.  This type of hedging is called "dynamic hedging".\n\nPage 2:\n\nNow that we know how algos hedge their options the question is how do we make a profit off this knowledge.  Right now it doesn\'t seem that obvious but there are some reasonable assumptions that we can make to get the ball rolling.  The first comes from the fact that the options dealers\' biggest customers are pension funds.  These funds need to protect their massive S&amp;P holdings so they will buy puts for protection.  They also want to make some extra money off of their assets so they will sell covered calls.  The options dealers are on the other side of this trade so they will be long calls and short puts.  \n\nNow we need to start talking about gamma and it influences the algos\' trading.  \n\nAnother way to think about delta is that it is roughly the probability that your option will be worth something at expiration.  So an at the money option should have a delta of about 50 because it is basically a coin toss on if it\'s going up or down.  However, if the market moves in a way that is favorable towards your position then the probability that your option will be in the money should be higher.  Hence the delta should also be higher.  This phenomena is gamma.  Gamma is the increase in the delta of your option when the underlying increases.  This is an issue for the market making algos because whenever the underlying moves they have to rehedge their position.  For example, if I buy a 50 delta call with 2 gamma then I will go short 50 shares to hedge.  Now the underlying goes up a dollar and I now have a 52 delta call (50 delta + 2 gamma) and I am short 50 shares.  I now need to short an additional 2 shares to stay neutral.  In this example we see that staying neutral is an active process that requires constant participation in the market.  \n\nIf you are still confused about how these options are hedged you can look at a more in depth explanation on page 3 of that squeeze metrics paper.  \n\nIn the next post I will explain how this active hedging impacts liquidity and influences the market.'), ('Late Friday Yolo vibes.

Last time we talked about how the mortgage rate was moving independently from the real rates, time to look at those pesky yields. Blackrock like another asset manager works with leverage, therefore they have to paying off debt on the majority of their holdings. As yields increase the payments to service that debt increases and with the majority of its revenue coming from that tasty MER or a percentage of their investment holdings their ability to service that debt is dropping and will drop much further as equities and assets continue to correct.

But here we are yet again another day and some fuckery afoot. Its getting a little exhausting at this point. But what we saw today was essentially JPOW reiterate that he is very hawkish (the exact same stand point he had at the testimony 2 or 3 weeks ago and pretty much the same stand point last Wednesday) but for some reason today the markets decided it was time to panic. We saw about a dip from 444.56 all the way down to 440.68 before we finally saw a recovery end of day back up to 444.39 to close. SPY closed at -0.03% which technically makes it a red day but overall really didn’t feel very red. \n\nThe morning movement of SPY was very up and down also with some very unexpected trend reversals.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4l0dtvjqto81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f46c74acd81e23e897fd4c03d60b53a57d56f21\n\nGoing into tomorrow it will be Important to keey an eye on the intraday high around 446 and the lows near 441. Those should be key support and resistance to watch as the day essentially while bearish ended in a sideways manner. \n\nWhat truly is impressive is that the VIX opened at 25.14 and closed at 23.54, dropping a full $2 without SPY moving upward and still finishing green. The VIX compared to SPY very much so under-reacted to the JPOW news today. \n\nTo be honest I actually don’t care if SPY goes all the way back to 480 or if it goes to 400. What I really just want is for SPY to go back to its normal trends where you can actually play it how it looks and not get burnt by a big green dildo candle or a big fat red fuck you candle without any warning. The overall movement does not matter but when the intraday movement is nothing but fuckery it is quite annoying. Volume wise we once again failed to meet the average turning in only 88.3 million for yet again another extremely low volume day. This is the lowest volume day since February 16th. The first sub 90mil day in over a month. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tv8nxtilqto81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500bb803be1eba98e0190710628684d58c6229a7\n\nNow the daily does tell a bit of a deeper story…. \n\nIt’s a little hard to tell in this pic because of the post market blue dotted line but the daily finished in a DOJI which COULD signal a reversal. Which after 4 massive red days would make sense… I mentioned Friday and this morning that today and tomorrow were going to be very telling of where this is going over the next few weeks. Unfortunately we didn’t get much direction. But the fact that JPOW once again told the market hey you idiots shits really bad and we really shouldn’t be bull running and these are the reasons why and the market said oh shit you are right for like an hour then said nah fuck that we actually are good to go for the bullrun says a lot… IF what JPOW said today isn’t going to tank the market then honestly I don’t really know what is going to stop it from going back to 460 outside of maybe a surprised rate hike or the next inflation number being 5x worse or something crazy. This market just doesn’t wanna be held down anymore. \n\nToday though we did close BELOW the 100 EMA at 445.08 (but broke it at one point in the morning). We also found support at the 50 EMA at 440.58 when we had the massive sell off. The fact that this didn’t break through the 50 EMA is quite bull telling if you ask me. But tomorrows finish will be telling. Looking at this chart currently IF we break through the 100 EMA over night at all or tomorrow intraday I would not be surprised to see this push towards 458 to retest the double top from February by the end of the week. IF we can break through 458 there really is nothing stopping this from 470 or 480 within the next few weeks. It wouldn’t shock me one bit to see with the VIX continuing to fall and this continuing to run this break through 458 in the next few days and inevitably retouch 470s by April.\n\nThe only thing I forsee to bring this down is either the US stepping into the physical war itself in Russia, Russia attacking the US, or MAYBE once the next CPI data drops and the next FOMC happens and we hit a recession officially. But  honestly we may be so recovered by then that we just have a minor dip back down 460 from 470 or 480 and return to the top after its priced in. \n\nOverall I would NOT encourage ANYONE to bet against the market right now. My tone may change tomorrow if by some miracle bears can get this to gap down and close BELOW the daily 200 ema at 438.18 and the daily 50 ema at 440.58. Until then im riding the 8ema wave bull train to the top. \n\nAs JPOW once said “Fuck your Puts.” \n\n  \nDM me if youd like to stay in touch after April 2nd are i will no longer be posting daily TA or pre market posts on here...')], '2022-03-22': [('Nancy Pelosi Buys $5,000,000 of $TSLA', 'Nancy Pelosi Buys $5,000,000 of $TSLA[removed]'), ('TSLA 5K -&gt; 23K in a day yolo.

From our math from before, this translates into a \\~3x the current share price of \\~$72, $162-216 a share.\n\nNow let\'s take a look at the competitors\n\nIn October 2021 right before the TMTG announcement\n\nFB Marketcap: 910B\n\nTWTR Marketcap: 50B\n\nPINS Marketcap: 34B\n\nSNAP Marketcap: 85B\n\nNFLX Marketcap: 295B\n\nPresent day\n\nFB Marketcap: 528B\n\nTWTR Marketcap: 26B\n\nPINS Marketcap: 14.5B\n\nSNAP: 46B\n\nNFLX 150B\n\nThis translates into\n\nFB: -42%\n\nTWTR: -52%\n\nPINS: -57%\n\nSNAP: -54%\n\nNFLX - 49%\n\nCompare this to the Nasdaq\n\nQQQ only -11.5% since Oct 20th, 2021\n\nWhat this means is these companies should of only collectively lost\n\nFB: 105B; TWTR: 6B; PINS: 4B; SNAP: 10B; NFLX: 34B\n\nInstead they have lost\n\nFB: 382B; TWTR: 24B; PINS 20B; SNAP: 39B; NFLX 145B\n\nThis a net difference of\n\nFB: 277B; TWTR: 18B; PINS: 16B; SNAP: 29B; NFLX: 111B\n\nFor a grand total of $451B loss in only just under 5 months.\n\nWhere is this money going?\n\nDWAC + 14B\n\nAAPL + 105B at a time when it should be tracking -11.5% benchmark (loss 280B) so a net offset +385B\n\nThere\'s a lot of nuance to this because there are more companies that are not publicly traded or hard to track because they are apart of GOOG or DIS etc. (to be honest even the AAPL is a hard one to compare)\n\nI\'m guessing about $500-600B in related market competitors marketcap has disappeared in net ahead of their indexes since the threat of TMTG\'s competition has presented itself.\n\nMy latest reasoning for a lag in this flow of capital is liquidity issues and requirements that this smart money cannot dump into DWAC. It\'s too small a float, even post merger. It\'s also probably outside of their requirements and perceived risk tolerance since it\'s a SPAC and hasn\'t filed an S4 yet.\n\n# Comparing The Fundamentals To Their Sector Competitors\n\nI\'m going to start with TMTG+ streaming services **(headed by the producer of America\'s Got Talent and Deal or No Deal)** since it\'s a much more simplistic model to users paying the company directly for its services.\n\nNetflix - 214 Million Paid Subscribers (this one has lost some serious marketcap since my last DD, comparable to above numbers for the other sector competitors)\n\nDisney+ - 118 Million Paid Subscribers\n\nHulu - 44 Million Paid Subscribers\n\nDiscovery+ - 15 Million Paid subscribers\n\nNetflix has 167B marketcap compared to 222 Million Paid Subscribes. This translates to about $752 in market cap per subscriber.\n\nLet\'s say TMTG+ achieves only 23M subscribers with only $600 per sub in marketcap . This alone would justify the current share price based off 14B marketcap.\n\nLet\'s say TMTG+ achieves only 50M subscribers at only $600 per sub in marketcap. This alone would justify a \\~2x increase in the share price based on a 30B marketcap.\n\nTranslating this aspect of the business you can roughly translate **every 10M TMTG+ subs to an additional $31 in share price.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\'s move forward to the Social Media aspect\n\nFacebook - Dec 2021 - 2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 917 B marketcap, $317 per monthly user in marketcap. - Mar 2022 -  2.89 B Monthly Active Users , 582 B marketcap, $182 per monthly user in marketcap.\n\nYoutube - 2 B Monthly Active Users (MAU), 500B marketcap, $250 per monthly user in marketcap.\n\nTiktok \\~1B users, \\~400B marketcap, \\~$400/user\n\nSnapchat \\~347MAU \\~ 58B marketcap \\~ $167/user (down from 264 since Dec)\n\nTwitter - 330M MAU, $30.5B marketcap, \\~$92  user marketcap. (down from 100 since Dec)\n\nYou can see that some companies are more valuable than others because of success of monetization. some companies are valued a lot higher per user. Giving these a market cap weighted average is about \\~$275 users/ marketcap (give or take a bit, the markets have been volatile)\n\nI\'m going to say TS, given its much higher APRU is going to actually be above average on this list. I said 100 per user back in Dec but given the latest info I\'ll get into I\'m going to put this at 193 for now\n\nThis would mean 100M users would translate into 19.3B in marketcap. So **for about 100M users you can add an additional $100 to the share price.**\n\nLet\'s talk about the news aspect of the business model.\n\nFox has a marketcap of 22.5B, lets say it achieves 25% of Fox\'s audience. That\'s an additional 5B in marketcap or **an additional $26 a share for every 25% of Fox\'s audience size from news. Or about $25 for every 500,000 viewers.** Also keep in mind Trump\'s rallies even now are getting a few million live viewers when you count all of his rallies across Rumble, Youtube, RSBN, OAN etc.\n\nDJT Jr is bringing an app to market called MxM which is an aggregator app to compete with Apple and Google news it\'s getting independent funding and may merge with TMTG in the future. Do a quick search on that.\n\nWho knows what other business venture and revenue will be brought in.\n\n# Key Performance Indicators\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wh06ij43a7p81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87bccf4289cb292a0809c333d35ea5f2eb72c059\n\nHere\'s a chart of projected revenue from the corporate slide deck you can find the SEC filings\n\nThese numbers are understated to be over delivered, clearly.\n\nTS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -Washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)\n\nFrom the user feedback on Truthsocial so far, it has been demonstrated that users with way less followers are getting way more engagement. Maybe even by a factor of 10x less followers getting 10 x more engagement. This is huge for ARPU (average revenue per user)\n\nTracking Trump\'s followers from people in the app suggests the App just hit 1 million users in the first month despite being in a highly limited access period where people are getting mostly wait listed. Trump has \\~700k followers using assumption that 70% of people are following Trump. Truth social is currently only available on the Apple App store and in the US for those on the waitlist. This should be opening very soon for web browser, android, and non-us as the infrastructure scales.\n\nExtrapolating this growth rate has been done in a few ways\n\nThe current linear growth rate is something like 20M/yr even in this limited period. Which is astounding\n\nHowever this rate has been increasing rapidly partly due to increase in infrastructure\n\nUsing a very aggressive approach (see the methodology in my post history)  Extrapolating Trump\'s Follower\'s Growth Report 3-21\n\n13262e\\^(0.175\\*365.25)\n\nIt says Truth would surpass Facebook in only 71 Days. (assuming 100% following of users.. obviously less days when you use the 70% following Trump assumptions)\n\nLets be a little more conservative and use the polynomial\n\n671.52x\\^2+7553.7x+9074.4\n\nThat says\n\n92M per a year, and that\'s with obvious near increases back to reverse of rate comparisons saying this will be even higher in the near term.\n\nUsing the 80% assumption this is 131M per year, a number which should easily increase before then (a new faster equation)\n\nAlso noting that this is for the first year. It would increase to a rate of 363M/yr by the second. 814M/yr by the third. And surpass Facebook around the Fourth or Fifth\n\nI suspect that the newer data coming in these weeks these equations will get much more aggressive than this current polynomial\n\nOf course we\'ll need more time and data to come in to build further confidence in these models, confidence and data which I believe will shock the markets and potentially serve as a major catalyst.\n\nThe big opening was said to be before end of Q1 so I\'m guessing that will be a big uptick in growth allowability in the next few weeks\n\nFor some comparisons\n\nPath to 1M users\n\nTumblr 27 months\n\nTwitter 24 months\n\nPinterest 20 months\n\nFacebook 10 months\n\nDropbox 7 months\n\nSpotify 5 months\n\nInstagram 3 months\n\nTruthsocial 1 month\n\nI have not yet been able to find any service or platform to exceed these rate assuming they weren\'t using existing infrastructure such as AWS, which TS is not. It using Rumble\'s infrastructure\n\n# Lets talk about Profit Margins\n\nTruthsocial is actually much likelier to have a much higher profit margin than Twitter because of severely reduced operating expenses, and why TMTG will probably be trading at more comparable ratios to Facebook not because of success of monetization but because of success of low operating expenses.\n\nFirst let me give you a peak into the burning dumpster fire that is Twitter\'s balance sheet\n\nStarting on page 43 of Twitter\'s Annual Report from 2020 [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\\_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020\\_Twitter\\_Annual\\_Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/FiscalYR2020_Twitter_Annual_Report.pdf)\n\nWe can see Twitter pulled in 3.2 B from Advertising Services, 508M from Data licensing for a total of 3.7B in revenue\n\n1.37B Cost revenue\n\n873M in \'Research and development\'\n\n888M in \'Sales and marketing\'\n\n562M in \'general and administrative\'\n\nTwitter netted negative 1.1B in profit after setting aside 1B for taxes.\n\nLet\'s break this down again\n\nTwitter pulled in $3.7B but twitter spent\n\n37% on cost of revenue: servers, buildings, upkeep etc.\n\n23% on Research and development: software engineers, sociologists, artists, focus groups (market research) (I believe moderators is in here as well)\n\n24% on Sales and marketing: sales employees for ads and marketing for userbase and available ad space.\n\n15% of general and administrative: executives, legal, finance, info tech, hr, consulting, moderators (in both categories probably), customer service etc.\n\n3% on interest and other: interest on debt financing, operations etc.\n\n29% on taxes.\n\nYes these numbers add to 131% of revenue or in other words a 31% net income loss.\n\nWhy is Twitter so expensive to run, why is this dumpster fire losing all of this money?\n\nLets go back in time to Twitter in 2011-2013 - Here\'s the same report from that time period. [https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc\\_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/ar/Twitter-Inc-2013-Annual-Report.pdf)\n\nPage 57\n\nGoing to compare to Twitters Monthly active users (MAU) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:\\~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20first%20quarter,daily%20active%20users%20(mDAU)).\n\n2013: \\~225M monthly active users (MAU)\n\nCost of Revenue : 266 M (\\~330M inflation adjusted)\n\nResearch and Development.(R&amp;D): 593M (\\~740M inflation adjusted)Sales and Marketing 316M (\\~400M inflation adjusted)General and Administrative 124M (\\~160M inflation adjusted)\n\n2011: \\~100M MAU\n\nCost of Revenue: 62M (\\~85M inflation adjusted)\n\nR&amp;D: 80M (\\~110M inflation adjusted)\n\nSales and marketing 26M (\\~36M inflation adjusted)\n\nGeneral and administrative 233M (\\~310M inflation adjusted)\n\nOk so lets do some ratios with inflation adjusted numbers compared to users\n\n2020: \\~330M MAU\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$4.15 per monthly active user\n\nR&amp;D: \\~$2.65 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: $2.7 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: $1.7 per monthly active user\n\n2013: \\~225M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$1.47 per monthly active user\n\nR&amp;D: \\~$3.29 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: \\~$1.78 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: \\~$0.71 per monthly active user\n\n2011: \\~100M monthly active users (MAU) (numbers below adjusted for inflation)\n\nCost of revenue: \\~$0.85 per monthly active user\n\nR&amp;D: \\~$1.10 per monthly active user\n\nSales and marketing: \\~$0.36 per monthly active user\n\nGeneral and admin: \\~$0.85 per monthly active user\n\nSo what\'s alarming about this trend is that twitter is becoming very expensive to operate on a per MAU basis.\n\nLet\'s recap\n\nCost of revenue went from $0.85 in 2011 per user to $4.15/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **388% increase**\n\nR&amp;D went from $1.10/user in 2011 to $2.65/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **141% increase**\n\nSales and marketing went from $0.36/user in 2011 to $2.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **650% increase**\n\nAnd general and admin from $0.85/user in 2011 to $1.70/user in 2020 (inflation adjusted) **100% increase**\n\nLet\'s see how Facebook does from their annual reports [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/14039b47-2e2f-4054-9dc5-71bcc7cf01ce.pdf)\n\nPage 64\n\n2021: FB 2.91B MAU (2,910M monthly active users)\n\n(CoR) Cost of revenue: 22.6B -

This also brings down the cost of office space etc. with remote work and fewer headcount.\n\nThis is one of the things they fear more than even the political ramifications is becoming obsolete in superior utilization of technology which they have can kicked to avoid a PR nightmare.\n\nPart 2 we\'ll discuss more specifics of margin numbers and expenditures with more historical data and how it will relate to future margins with more specific numbers on Truth Social.\n\nIt would be much harder and more expensive to program an AI to be biased towards political ideas instead of more hard set rules of logic. It would require constant upkeep to keep up with flip flopping rules and exemptions etc. An AI would be a much more solid long lasting algorithm if it was free from these ever changing agendas.\n\nIn other words being woke will be obsolete by superior unbiased artificial intelligence. Also selection of ad space being removed from political and PR expense etc. nonsense. The free market will bid up ad-space and engagement to increase naturally from a more exciting and free environment free from biased and expensive bureaucratic moderation and selection.\n\n# Lets Talk Share Price\n\nSo currently the markets are priced at \\~72 a share would would translate to something like\n\n40M TS users ($22) + 5M TMTG+ subs ($27.5) + 4% of Fox\'s audience ($4.32), 0.5% of AWS ($7.9) \\~ $61.72\n\nYou can see this is a bit comical for what\'s being priced in for a someone who is as well known as DJT who had over 150M followers online and over 71M votes in his 2nd run for president. We\'ve all seen the portfolio trackers and many others get banned off TWTR lately. Pelosi tracker is back up on Truthsocial already\n\nHere\'s a potential scenario\n\n300M TS users (\\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 25M TMTG+ subs ($77.5) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $429.5 and still have massive room for improvement\n\nMore scenarios\n\n600M TS users (\\~1/5th of facebook) ($600) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124) + 50% Fox Audience ($52) = $776 a share and still have massive room for improvement\n\nA total blow out of just one of the aspects\n\n1B TS users (\\~1/3rd of facebook) ($1000) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($124)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = **$1228 a share**\n\nAnother example\n\n300M TS users (\\~1/10th of facebook) ($300) + 60M TMTG+ subs ($186) + 100% Fox Audience ($104) ($52) = $590 and still have massive room for improvement\n\nImagine in these scenarios it will be trading for much more aggressive ratios **so**\n\n# DWAC 1000\n\nwith much additional upside after on fundamentals is not a mathematical challenge.\n\n1.5B TS users (\\~1/2 of facebook) ($1500) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \\~**$2000 a share**\n\n3B TS users (\\~1/2 of facebook) ($3000) + 100M TMTG+ subs ($310)  + 100% Fox Audience ($104)  = \\~**$3414 a share**\n\n3B TS users (\\~entire market) ($3000) + 250M (entire market) TMTG+ subs ($775)  + Above Fox Audience ($400)  = \\~**$4200 a share** along way to go to get there\n\n# Who else is bullish\n\nKevin O\'Leary from shark tank has said this is "going to work" search of O\'Leary DWAC.\n\nSpeculated Possible/Likely of the 36 PIPE investors to be disclosed (another catalyst): Lutnick, Thiel, Musk, Schnatter, Chamath, White, McMahon, Salman,, Steve Wynnn, Bernard Marcus, Roger Penske, Carln Icahn, Rex Tillerson, Lindell . More info about these people in my post history and why, at least in some cases like Lutnick, Musk, and Thiel there is a lot of info to suggest this is probably true\n\n# Short Interest and Gamma Ramp\n\nThere\'s been reported to be about 4-5M Shares shorted on this low 28.7M float. A recipe for disaster for shorts. Is also on the reghso FTD list\n\n\\~4M in SI and \\~1M in FTD. At least. It\'s also been hypothesized that the market markers are only holding \\~4-5M shares based on Liquidity Pool (LP) Theory Math (see post history) this would mean the SLP ratio is over 100%, reported SI is 13.4%, DTC Ratio \\~2, basically no shares left to borrow (100% utilization), cost to borrow is \\~70% but has been seen usually above 100% and has gone as high as &gt;300% at some points.\n\nThere is massive gamma ramping in danger of happening on call options and float evaporation potential. I won\'t get into it more here and now, check post history and google search maxpain dwac\n\n# FUD\n\n**Addressing common FUD - Understanding actual risk and nonsensical Fear Uncertainty and Doubt**\n\nAh yes. This company has been the biggest story of the last decade probably with all of the FUD. Ladies and gentlemen, a community of people has been hard at work for months debunking all of this\n\nLet\'s begin\n\nI know many reading this will get very emotional both long and short and will look for any reason to make this sound bigger or smaller or impossible or dumb. There\'s also many people who do not want this to happen for their own personal benefits. So here\'s some common things that are said and a general counter to it.\n\n**FUD:** "People won\'t want to advertise there"\n\n**Counter**: According to CNN facebook was never at risk of this. This rhetoric never had much grounds in reality\n\n&gt;Facebook generated $69.7 billion from advertising in 2019, more than 98% of its total revenue for the year. And most of those ad dollars don\'t come from companies like Starbucks ([SBUX](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SBUX&amp;source=story_quote_link)) and Coca Cola so much as the sprawling list of small and medium-sized businesses who use Facebook to attract customers and build their brands.when COO Sheryl Sandberg said the top 100 advertisers represented "less than 20%" of total ad revenue.📷The Facebook ad boycott is starting to rattle investors"Facebook has an enormous number of advertiser clients," said Nicole Perrin, an analyst at eMarketer. "They\'re definitely pretty reliant on the long tail of small business advertisers."\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Even as Facebook confronts by far the largest advertiser boycott in its history, the sheer number of advertisers on its platform may insulate the company from too much financial fallout. At the same time, it remains an open question whether many big and small advertisers can afford to stay away from the powerful platform it built for very long\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;"I think it\'s relatively unlikely that small businesses \\[and\\] small brands will join the boycott, because they\'re the ones most reliant on Facebook for access to their customers," Perrin said.\n\nCNN\'s website  slash 2020/06/30/tech/facebook-ad-business-boycott/index.html\n\n**Counter:** There will be direct monetization outside of ads (see TMTG+ section) also Companies will have to go where people are advertising with their attention and dollars. It\'s easy for companies to dissociate from where their ads are located when the free market forces their hand. "Our ads are located in places that do not represent our beliefs as a company, we are solely interested in providing business to our customers despite their personal identities" " see it\'s not that hard to find work arounds for minor problems like this. Content creators will likely be supporting each other as well with a cut going to the host (much like Twitch, web3.0 etc.)\n\n**FUD:** "\\*The merger might fail or get blocked resulting in this going bad."\\*\n\n**Counter**: SPACs don\'t fail for the reasons described or eluded to by the outlets. [u/independence\\_hall](https://www.reddit.com/u/independence_hall/) has a great post "The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger" please see his post history and read it. He did the leg work and debunked this. It\'s almost a zero chance of happening. See posts  \\*\\*"\\*\\*An update to my SEC/FINRA inquiry post and possible S-4 timeline " and " The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger. Another COMPLETE breakdown of the SEC/FINRA inquiry, and how the SEC ALREADY APPROVED A SPAC MERGER in the past that was sanctioned by the SEC for lying to its investors."\n\n**FUD**: The roll out has been slow and unsuccessful\n\n**Counter:** Actually no it has been record breaking and see the part of the DD above about growth rate projections. Anyone who doesn\'t understand this is comparing to AWS or existing infrastructure rollouts. I have not yet had one person point me to a valid example of a new platform or service rolling out faster at its inception with its own infrastructure. Also this platform was said be rolled out by end of Q1. It is not end of Q1 yet. TS got 1.5B views in the first 24 hrs -washington examiner (just on apple products, there are only 1.8B apple products.)\n\n**FUD:** They Have Offices in Wuhan\n\n**Counter:** So do: IBM, Deloitte, EY, Huawei, PwC, HSBC, Walmart, Fedex, Hewlet Packard, Pfizer, Apple, Uber, Starbucks, Procter and Gamble, Cummins, Morgan Stanley, Siems, Byte Dance, KFC, Motorola, Nissan, Alibaba, NIO,\n\n**FUD:** "Trump doesn\'t know what he\'s doing he can\'t even open email"\n\n**Counter:** Trump just got over a billion in PIPE funding (largest in SPAC history). There\'s plenty of well paid people with the right background on the company. Trump is largely here for traction, which is the primary issue all social media companies face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr0rfgv5a7p81.jpg?width=1361&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c5f452c3dff000eb5f18c10bd4bd557dc8e6511\n\nThere\'s also an agreement with Rumble to use their services\n\n**FUD:** "This will be GAB/Parler 2.0 failure"\n\n**Counter:** TMTG+ and the other services are nothing like the markets that these are in. Secondly Parler was becoming massively successful very quickly before it was pulled from the app store and AWS violated contract removing it. Parler is back now. TMTG is safe .

I saw quite a few candles that were under 1 mil volume today which is very rare for spy. \n\nBut nonetheless despite a very what I would call contradictory opening that required a lot of patience we did finally around 11am get the push we were looking for to finally step into a bull run. We rejected hard off the 449 resistance level falling all the way back down near 447 before finally during power hour after having 4 rejections at 448.8 we broke through and pushed it all the way up to 450.49 to close out the day up a cool 1.5%. Today we saw some of the lowest volume I have seen in a long time but we also saw some of the highest buy volume I have seen in months. It was very interesting to say the least because with the type of buy pressure we saw on SPY today we should have seen some very large and violent moves up but we did not see that. \n\nThe VIX was the true winner today opening at 23.61 and falling all the way to a low of 21.49 before closing around 21.68 for an impressive 8% day! Despite the movement of the VIX today we did not see SPY react how many I would anticpate it to with such an unraveling of the VIX.

The one thing that the bulls do have going for them is that they managed to get this candle to close back ABOVE the daily 100 ema which is a bullish trend. But what I am seeing set up currently is a similar trend we had back in February where we did a massive run up. Broke down. Broke back up for a double top at 458 and then crashed even lower. Granted this time is only over a 3 day period its very possible with only one red candle in 8 days (granted one was technically a -0.03% day). That is a whole lot of green in a very short period of time.

The case for LONG GME.', 'Why GME is the next TSLA. The case for LONG GME.First off, congrats to everyone that made bank from that price action this week. It has been a refreshing change from all of the loss porn. Even though my tits remain jacked for the rest of the week and the short term momentum, I want to discuss my thoughts on GME, why it is a great LONG play based on fundamentals, and why I think it will be the next TSLA. \n\nFirst, these two companies have some essential similarities for my comparison\n\n1. They have a huge retail following and remarkably loyal/enthusiastic investor base\n2. Charismatic, passionate, and incredibly successful leaders in Cohen and Elon\n3. The companies are developing new tech to be leaders in a mostly untapped market \n\nMy comparison on the fundamental side will focus on current day GME as compared to TSLA in 2017.\n\nTSLA (2017)                  GME (today)\n\nMarket cap                           71b                                    10b               \n\nShare Price                            70                                      141\n\nRevenue                                 11b                                    6.1b\n\nEPS                                       -2.37                                    -5.25\n\nCurrent Assets                       6.5b                                    2.6b\n\nCurrent Liabilities                 7.6b                                    1.3b\n\nLong term debt                     11.6b                                  40m (yes, million)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, looking at these numbers they are not perfect, but I think the same thing ultimately held TSLA back that will hold GME back from a fundamental perspective. This being EPS. Both companies proving to grow revenue, but not turning profit or creating cash flow. From a balance sheet perspective, GME is actually quite a bit better here with 2:1 assets:liabilities and essentially no long term debt. The cash burn for GME is a result of their investment into new streams of revenue and will hopefully start to show improvement in regard to EPS with NFT marketplace opening. This same lack of cash flow generation held back TSLA for years, but they did eventually turn positive in 2020 and guess what happened to the share price? Yep, rocket emojis.\n\nTesla share price went from 130 in Jan, 2020 to 793 in Jan, 2021 (adjusted price for splits)\n\nI think long term, if you believe in the NFT marketplace as a good move for the business of GME (as I do), we could see similar price action with institutional adoption and closed short positions over time. \n\nA couple of other things GME has working in their favor:\n\n1. Insiders really believe. Insider buys 104k shares the last 2 days, sells 743 shares (form 4 filing)\n2. Shrinking float. 76m shares - 13.6m(18% insiders) - 21.3m(28% institutions) - 10m (DRS) = **31.1m**\n\nTLDR: GME is the next TSLA (in terms of stock performance). Once NFT marketplace starts to generate revenue and EPS turns positive we will see a TSLA-style run. \n\nDisclosure: 343 shares at 153 average\n\nI like the stock'), ('Oil stocks', 'Oil stocksWhy are oil stocks going up when spy goes down and vice versa?'), ('I Fucked Up', "I Fucked UpHi, I have fucked up and I wanted to share my story with you guys.\n\n**TLDR;** I let 50 spy puts expire in the money, Next day I was funded 2million dollars in cash and short 5000 shares of spy and tried to recoup my losses. Got margin called and I now owe my broker 330.000 dollars. I’m officially retarded.\n\nYesterday, I bought 50 ODTE Spy put options on strike 444. I was trying to sell them just seconds before close because spy was dropping like hell in the last few seconds. Now ofcourse my sell order didn't go through and now i was stuck with the option which expired slightly ITM. Apparantly my broker excercises these contracts automatically. Even if you don't have the funds.\n\nThings turned out for the worst. When the market openened the next day, I was given 2 million dollars on my account and I owed 5000 spy shares to the broker. I wasn’t prepared for anything like this and went crazy when I saw this. I was down 8000 on my balance as spy went up since yesterday. So I had 2 million in cash, -5000 in spy shares and a net balance of -8000.\n\nFirst thing I checked was if I could trade with the 2 million. And what the f\\*, I could. I started dropping loads of money on spy puts and it went in my way for a few seconds but then it all came crashing down. Spy went up and I kept doubling down, with almost 700.000 dollars in spy puts at a certain moment when I started getting called on my phone. The great Margin Call. I didn't pick up because I was in disbelief as to what was happening. I do have a gambling problem of which I recovered a few years ago but stocks and option trading got me back into it since these last few months. So I was in a total rush constantly chasing my losses.\n\nBut as things kept getting worse I had to pick up the phone. After a long conversation with heads of the company my positions were closed and I now owe this broker 330.000 dollars. This is really depressing and I don't have any money to pay that off. I don't know what to do anymore. I went full retard on thinking I would get away with this. And just to think if I played spy calls with all that money.. I would've been so damn rich.. sigh. Tomorrow they will contact me on how to pay this all back, if any of you degenerates have an idea on how to best deal with this, please let me know.\n\nBut seriously, I’m freaking terrified. I feel like my life is over and don’t know what to do. How can they give 2 million dollar in credit to someone with only 1k to his name.

Broker next day excercises the contracts, gives me 2.2million in cash and -5000 in spy shares with a net balance of -8000 dollar few minutes before market open. I freak out and try to chase my losses with spy puts with the 2.2 million in cash. Few hours later they call me and close my positions, and just like that I now owe them 330K. **END**\n\nSome of you had some remarks on how this is possible and if this post was even real. I just want to make a few things clear:\n\n* The broker here doesn't allow for any margin so you can't write options if you don't have the collateral. For me, this kept me sure I would never come in a margin situation. I only ever wanted to trade options, not write or excercise.\n* The moment the 50 0DTE SPY options expired ITM, nothing happened untill next day half an hour before market open. So I was completely surprised by what happened. Since I didn't have any shares, I thought they just wouldn't excercise because I have the right, not the obligation to do so. I never gave my permission to exercise these contracts. I exptected them to expire worthless.\n* So get in my situation: You only played with 2-3k of dollars the day before, which is a huge deal to me. You wake up, open your account and suddenly there's 2,2 million in cash, a net balance of -8k and you owe the broker 5000 SPY shares you can't afford at that moment. No call, no e-mail explaining the situation. I freak the f\\* out.\n* My initial thought is I need to get my balance back to zero if I wish to buy back the 5000 SPY shares as I was thinking it wasn't possible if I didn't have the money. In a complete rush and without thinking I just followed what the market was doing that very moment at open and SPY was dropping so I started buying SPY puts. Ofcourse with my luck SPY just went up after that. I tried chasing my losses and doubling down, in complete disbelief as to what was happening. I wasn't abusing the situation, I only was trying to get my balance back to zero.\n* Few hours later I'm down deep 700k in SPY puts as it keeps rising. And believe me, this sounds retarded, it is, but this was all in such a complete rush it feels like only seconds went by. That's when I got my first anonymous call. That was my 'wake-up' call. I suddenly realized this was all actually real. I stop trading.\n* A few moments later they buy back 5000 shares on my account without my permission. So now I'm down 700k in put options and no cash left on my balance. A few seconds later they start closing out some positions.\n* At this moment I decide to call them. The heads of the company are all in a freaking meeting because of my situation and are on the call. They explain to me what's happening and say they have to close my positions to prevent further damage to, and so they do. I now owe them 330K, all of this in only a few hours time.\n* I NEVER had to prove to them I had any amount of net worth or assets before signing up. The only thing I had to do to sign up with them and start options trading was answering a few questions online and checking the I read the terms and agreement box. (Something I know almost 99% of you guys never read)\n* I did do my research and knew the real risk is in writing options, not buying options since you only risk what you play with. It says you have the **RIGHT,** **not the** **OBLIGATION** to sell shares if you buy a PUT option.\n\nLooking back on this situation I now know I should've called as soon as that balance hit my portfolio. It's easy to say but when things like that happen and you are in debt, you just can't think clearly. Like I said, this all happened in such a rush and looking back at it, I am still in disbelief this happened to me.\n\nI am now trying to figure this situation out and I am just amazed by a few things:\n\n* They 'lent' 2million to a person of whom they don't have any knowledge of credit score, assets or cash balance. Literally anyone on the verge of risking it all could repeat my situation. Not that I did this on purpose, I want to be very clear of that.\n* They didn't immediatly buy back the shares on market open, which would've left me with a -8k balance but no further money to invest/gamble with. Since they have a policy on not giving margin, this really surprised me.\n* My FIRST anonymous call came in when I was already deep 700K in spy puts. My FIRST. How the hell. Alarm bells should be ringing whenever someone decides to further increase their margin. This took them 3-4 hours of me constantly doubling down.\n\nI'm not trying to pleed my case here. But I just think some fundamental mistakes were made on both sides. I'm not saying I shouldn't be punished for this. I will be paying for my mistakes and we are looking for a settlement. I will keep you guys updated.\n\nThanks for the laughs and helping words, this really helps me through this tough situation.\n\n**PS:** I realise if I've just bought some calls at open I could hedge the position out because if SPY dropped I could buy back the shares for lower, if it went up my call options would settle the difference.

It was mentioned that meta’s “metaverse” concept has been laughed off by a few people\n\n2. The overwhelming success of oculus  is catalyst \n\nOn that note I thought it might be worth clarifying what is “the metaverse”\n\nWhat we consider “the metaverse” is essentially and world you can interact socially in. World of Warcraft is a metaverse, as is Fortnite as is the oculus spaces meta is creating. Collectively these all make up “the metaverse” the conocensus is that we should gravitate towards a technology where the metaverse is like the web, and each “space” is like a website we can visit. \n\nFacebooks interpretation is just one facet of this.\n\nWhy is this important? \n\nBecause as mentioned above and on the call, 80% of the vr market is oculus, and by extension meta. So even if their metaverse concept is a flop, it will probably be their devices were connecting with. And they will figure out how to monetize that.\n\n\nOn that note, why is occulus dominating vr? For two reasons, they are taking apples approach to this space.\n\nSteam is like google. They have an open platform, that manufacturers can tap into, htc, Hp, etc. these are just hardware executions to steams vr platform. Like google/android, it’s fragmented with each manufacturer having different variants of vr, each with different tracking technologies. From a development perspective, this is going yo be a nightmare.\n\nOcculus on the other hand, not only connects to steam, is easy to use and setup, and most importantly, is the only headset WITH ITS OWN PLATFORM \n\nOcculus has its own “home”, own works apps, own events, own social spaces, and I guarantee you these will all integrate.\n\nSo until apple enters the space, meta is the apple of vr'), ('In 2015, both $AMZN and $BABA wanted to acquire ContextLogic ($WISH) for $10 billion, but we’re rejected.

Since many of you were worried I would commit Sudoku, I decided to do a follow-up post.\n\n**TL;DR** **for whoever didn't see my first post**: Bought 50 spy 0DTE spy puts on wednesday, they expired slightly in the money even though I tried to sell. Broker next day excercises the contracts, gives me 2.2million in cash and -5000 in spy shares with a net balance of -8000 dollar few minutes before market open. I freak out and try to chase my losses with spy puts with the 2.2 million in cash. Few hours later they call me and close my positions, and just like that I now owe them 330K. **END**\n\nSome of you had some remarks on how this is possible and if this post was even real. I just want to make a few things clear:\n\n* The broker here doesn't allow for any margin so you can't write options if you don't have the collateral. For me, this kept me sure I would never come in a margin situation. I only ever wanted to trade options, not write or excercise.\n* The moment the 50 0DTE SPY options expired ITM, nothing happened untill next day half an hour before market open. So I was completely surprised by what happened. Since I didn't have any shares, I thought they just wouldn't excercise because I have the right, not the obligation to do so. I never gave my permission to exercise these contracts. I exptected them to expire worthless.\n* So get in my situation: You only played with 2-3k of dollars the day before, which is a huge deal to me. You wake up, open your account and suddenly there's 2,2 million in cash, a net balance of -8k and you owe the broker 5000 SPY shares you can't afford at that moment. No call, no e-mail explaining the situation. I freak the f\\* out.\n* My initial thought is I need to get my balance back to zero if I wish to buy back the 5000 SPY shares as I was thinking it wasn't possible if I didn't have the money. In a complete rush and without thinking I just followed what the market was doing that very moment at open and SPY was dropping so I started buying SPY puts. Ofcourse with my luck SPY just went up after that. I tried chasing my losses and doubling down, in complete disbelief as to what was happening. I wasn't abusing the situation, I only was trying to get my balance back to zero.\n* Few hours later I'm down deep 700k in SPY puts as it keeps rising. And believe me, this sounds retarded, it is, but this was all in such a complete rush it feels like only seconds went by. That's when I got my first anonymous call. That was my 'wake-up' call. I suddenly realized this was all actually real. I stop trading.\n* A few moments later they buy back 5000 shares on my account without my permission. So now I'm down 700k in put options and no cash left on my balance. A few seconds later they start closing out some positions.\n* At this moment I decide to call them. The heads of the company are all in a freaking meeting because of my situation and are on the call. They explain to me what's happening and say they have to close my positions to prevent further damage to, and so they do. I now owe them 330K, all of this in only a few hours time.\n* I NEVER had to prove to them I had any amount of net worth or assets before signing up. The only thing I had to do to sign up with them and start options trading was answering a few questions online and checking the I read the terms and agreement box. (Something I know almost 99% of you guys never read)\n* I did do my research and knew the real risk is in writing options, not buying options since you only risk what you play with. It says you have the **RIGHT,** **not the** **OBLIGATION** to sell shares if you buy a PUT option.\n\nLooking back on this situation I now know I should've called as soon as that balance hit my portfolio. It's easy to say but when things like that happen and you are in debt, you just can't think clearly. Like I said, this all happened in such a rush and looking back at it, I am still in disbelief this happened to me.\n\nI am now trying to figure this situation out and I am just amazed by a few things:\n\n* They 'lent' 2million to a person of whom they don't have any knowledge of credit score, assets or cash balance. Literally anyone on the verge of risking it all could repeat my situation. Not that I did this on purpose, I want to be very clear of that.\n* They didn't immediatly buy back the shares on market open, which would've left me with a -8k balance but no further money to invest/gamble with. Since they have a policy on not giving margin, this really surprised me.\n* My FIRST anonymous call came in when I was already deep 700K in spy puts. My FIRST. How the hell. Alarm bells should be ringing whenever someone decides to further increase their margin. This took them 3-4 hours of me constantly doubling down.\n\nI'm not trying to pleed my case here. But I just think some fundamental mistakes were made on both sides. I'm not saying I shouldn't be punished for this. I will be paying for my mistakes and we are looking for a settlement. I will keep you guys updated.\n\nThanks for the laughs and helping words, this really helps me through this tough situation.\n\n**PS:** I realise if I've just bought some calls at open I could hedge the position out because if SPY dropped I could buy back the shares for lower, if it went up my call options would settle the difference. It all happened so fast I couldn't think clearly -&gt; I'm retarded."), ('Hoping for a strong AAPL pullback', 'Hoping for a strong AAPL pullbackI have 400 apple shares I bought many years ago.

But SPY opened the week at 444.34, seeing an intraweek low of 440.68 and closed the week at 452.69 just $0.19 below its high of 452.98. \n\nWe will start at the weekly candle and work our way back. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmqwa9oaimp81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5999884fdfa51c2325eca379d5767858804f6a65\n\nnote- the grey and pink channels are from the daily chart and do not exactly correlate over to the weekly chart very well so they are off a little but on the daily you will see their true placements. \n\nOn SPY weekly candle the week saw a mild 1.84% gain after the monsterous 5.82% gain last week. Spy now from last weeks low has gone from 415.79 as a low to a high of 452.98. That is a 2 week total gain of 8.9% total in two weeks. That is a ton of green movement. A few things to note on this chart going into next week to watch. \n\nThe candle did finish as a VERY strong and solid hanging man candle. The hanging man candle is the opposite of a hammer candle. The hanging man candle COULD assume a reversal of trend going into next week. \n\nanother thing to keep an eye on is the 20day EMA which lies now at 445.73. This is the first weekly candle closes ABOVE the 20 ema in 10 weeks. That is a very long time to be below the weekly 20 ema which generally trades as support not resistance. With this candle perched above the 20ema weekly we could see the potential for a bullish continuation. There is also a case to be made that SPY may attempt to test that 20 ema support intraweek before going any higher. \n\nA keep resistance I will be watching (that I also expected to test today… and we may have tested had we not had the massive sell off with the VIX reaction to the Saudi attack) is 458. The level of 458 is currently set up as a double top and very well could play out as a triple top IF spy fails to break any daily candle above 458. \n\nVolume wise this week closed out at 385million total volume which is the lowest volume week since the week of December 27th. The interesting thing about that is that is was the last bullish week before spy saw a massive sell off that we are currently recovering from. \n\nWeek candle wise: \n\nBears would want to see the 20 ema at 445.73 and then the weekly 8 ema at 441.97 test as support and see that support fail with an closure of the week back BELOW the weekly 20 ema at minimum but preferably below the weekly 8 ema. \n\nBulls would need to see a green week that tests 445.73 (weekly 20 ema) as support and confirms it before breaking cleanly through 458 with a weekly closure above 460 to prevent a double top from the week of January 18th which had a high of 460. Bulls also need to see a green continuation candle and avoid any sort of bearishly engulfing candle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qq09rscimp81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67a48e3227e4084b642646170760b00ff31fb4bf\n\nNow looking at the daily as I had mentioned this one you can clearly see the channels much better and the overall trend. \n\nThis week we technically had two red candles Wednesday which finished down 1.29% and then Monday which finished down 0.003% and as a doji. So technically we had three green days and two red days this week but as you can see on the chart due to Mondays price action it actually is represented as four green and one red. \n\nMonday was the day the markets over-reacted mid-day to JPOW letting us know a 0.5bps rate hike as for sure going to happen, that they may do additional 0.5bps rate hikes and that they could do some outside of the meetings if needed. The odd thing about the way the market reacted was 1. Everything he said was already mentioned the previous week at FOMC and during his Wednesday testimony yet the markets rallied like crazy. He really did not say anything out of line or that I would call surprising. Yet the markets acted like it was the first time they heard JPOW be hawkish… it was odd. And 2. Despite the clear over reaction that sent SPY from its highs of 446 to 441 which is an impressive 1.1% drop intraday the markets still rallied from 441 to 444.39 to close the day at -0.03%. \n\nThe markets at this point truly do not seem to care about anything that is going on anymore. Much like today they very dramatically over-reacted to the Saudi oil field attack but still recovered and matched the intraday high before close after being down a pretty significant amount. \n\nWednesday was the only true red day this week managing a measily -1.29% close for the day. After 6 green candles myself and many though that could be the start of the dip but SPY had other places closing out another two green candles. \n\nDaily wise I mentioned on Wednesday that a close below the 100 EMA was bearish but SPY managed to get back above the 100 ema to close two candles above the 100 EMA for the first time since January 14th. \n\nIntraday volume has been extremely low with Monday being the highest volume at 107 million and the lowest on Thursday at 65 million. The weekly volume average this week was 77million per day compared to 111 million per day last week. That’s a 34million volume per day difference which is insane considering that’s half the volume we saw in one day on Thursday. \n\nI am not really sure where the volume went someone said this week at one point that it was about 60-80% retail trading this week and 20-40% institutions trading. I have two theories. Either institutions are still sitting in cash fearing a recession and a true crash OR they are waiting until SPY hits just the right point and they are going to pull the rug one last time before we see a new high. \n\nThe lower volume is a concern not so much because once volume dramatically decreased we saw a dramatic bullrun but because what that increased volume can do to spy. This can either get very bloody or very green real fast if the volume returns to its normal. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wz1m0f3fimp81.png?width=852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe3cea8c5d615fa35df30ee3d0004d1721bdddb3\n\nSPY has found itself inside a nice little bullish channel here that it does not seem to want to fall out of. This channel gives spy an opportunity to see 460 as a high Monday or if it were to break through the critical 450 level it could test support down near 444. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x711xuxfimp81.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47b5ef2e83c7b8130e8441e0bb665f01f9e4082c\n\nIf bulls want to see this see 460 and test the double top it needs a clear break through and holding of the 453 resistance line it traded under today intraday. \n\nThe true winner of this week was the VIX and Apple though. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2c8mvjhimp81.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a04f0ab1318576cdc0fcf49a9a3c13af1b582ac8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcv6xemiimp81.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c46789559fc66ddbedac3b23bc8aa505304957c0\n\nIf you look at apple it has also been on an impressive tear from a low on March 15th of 150.38 to a high today of 175.28 giving it a beyond wild nine green daily candles in a row. I am not positive but I am sure this is close to some sort of record. Apple has gone up a total of 16.5% in 9 trading days and is only 4.3% of its ATH of 182.94.\n\nWhy am I mentioning Apple in a SPY TA post? Well here is why. Apple currently makes up 6.94% of the total weight of Spy. The last time we saw our massive dip in January and had the crazy bullish recovery back then guess who also led the charge then? You guessed it Apple. \n\nOn January 24th SPY hit is low and reached its top on February 9th before retracing to its low on February 24th. Guess what days apple hit its low, high and low…. January 24th \uf0e0 February 9th \uf0e0 March 15th. \n\nUntil we see apple close a true red day and it loses its momentum to the upside SPY is not going to see any downside. Currently Apple daily MACD is still very bullish and its RSI is only at 64 which if you look back to its peak in December it will easily run &gt;70. I watch apple intraday to guide where SPY is going. They don’t usually go far from eachother. I have even began picking up a few apple options here and there this week too depending on who is lagging. \n\nNow the VIX saw an absolutely impressive week opening at 25.14, with a intra week high of 25.14, a low of 20.8 today where it also closed. The Vix over the last 3 week has gone from a high of 37.52 all the way down to todays close at 20.8. That’s a 45% decrease in 3 weeks. So what does that mean? That means over the last three weeks we have seen a peak in fear in the markets which obviously coincides with the low in the market. Looking back to this last year VIX has run from an average of about 15 to 20 depending on the time frame. That means we are near the mean reversion of the VIX. \n\nTo me this means that SPY will not be pulled along the way it has been the last week. The VIX intraday for this entire week has been the one in charge. Just like today we saw the massive VIX spike intraday but as soon as the VIX settled and started to trend back down Spy settled and started to trend back up and that’s when I knew I could capitalize on some calls. \n\nThe VIX (fear) seems pretty low and numb at this point and I really do not see anything that is going to re-spook it the way it was in January and February. With the wildcards of inflation, fed movements, war, oil, etc. all priced in at this point we really cant expect anything to disrupt the VIX. Both “fear” reactions this week (jpow Monday and then Saudi oil field attack today) were handled intraday and the fear disappeared very quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\nWeekly profit goal= $2500\n\nactual profit goal= $1025 \n\n(I took a big loss Monday on some perfectly badly timed calls as JPOW tanked the market and had to grind my way back to green).\n\nI made 25 trades this week total (23 spy, 2 apple)\n\nApple- 2 for 2. Average%= 16%\n\nSpy- 17 for 25, Average%= 3%\n\ntotal average% per trade= 5% this week \n\nBig loss%= 70% on a 0dte call that went against me \n\nBiggest win%= 50% on some 0dte calls bought near the bottom today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall- it was a very good week for me. I did not make my profit goal but If I erased the one call I had went very heavy on Monday I would have beat my weekly profit goal. This week I continued to perfect my strategy and continued to test not only my patience but my trust in my indicators and strategy. Early in the week due to the JPOW dump I did get slightly discouraged but no one could have predicted that (though its also a risk to trade when a speaker is going to take like JPOW or Biden) and I should have had a proper stop loss on. This was a good week for me and today I finished on a very strong note. I had 2 days this week where I had no red trades all day also which is always great. \n\nI hope everyone has a great weekend and look forward to seeing you Monday! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember- Next Friday April 1st I will no longer be posting daily TA and pre market TA to reddit.

Also BLK is going to 0.\n\nHere is S&amp;P 500 doing a pretty nice head and shoulders pattern. There's a sort of secondary channel that's pretty apparent and helps predict the angle of the next/ declining channel if you believe in fortune telling and whatever.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/asp5b2mj1up81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b616173520fbfc93b087737e58c8c0cddf23a2c4\n\nHere is BLK doing a *italics* version of the same pattern. Maybe it got pulled towards the full moon when Venus was in retrograde or something. Since all the dates for the other points match up I pulled the price on Apr 14 and May 20.

Looks like the 10 year bond yield likes to stay in its nice channel and just test the top right before recessions. For some reason probably related to some kind of space warlock it seams to always top out on the bottom formed off the recession that happened about 20 years before each time. There are three exceptions to that rule though,1987 and 1994 and 2022 which all pop out above the line early to test the roof. I wonder if bad shit happened in 1987 and 1994? Lets check the tarot cards. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddi3x47m2up81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23d718c44d23998d1b5f00f961b24b6d02e89ec4\n\n10yr yield in blue, S&amp;P500 in purple for 1987. Damn Daniel, that doesn't look too good. On black Monday the Dow dropped 22% and the entire world's equities were obliterated. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wtvar2mr3up81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98a75d5b9ce5c334b0d74c19932a591474772bf8\n\nHere's 1994. Something called the 1994 bond market crash. Apparently the FED acknowledged inflation was creeping up, raised rates a quarter point and promised more hikes throughout the year, then the bond market dumped the world over (not kidding incase you were also 2 and don't know this either.) The S&amp;P500 dropped from it's high of around $480 (Also not kidding) about 10% but recovered by the start of 1995 and began a rally that ripped like 300% by 2000. So maybe bulls are going to win this round after all, but keep in mind between 1990 and 1994 the S&amp;P500 rallied from only about 290 to 480 or about 69% where as between 2018 and 2022 the S&amp;P500 has rallied from holy shit... 69% from 2900 to 4800 (still not making this up). Okay so there are some similarities... Shit are my puts fucked?

They are dumping bonds, pouring cash into stocks and jacking yields up so that he has to restart QE to get them back down. I agree with this statement 100% and it seams like that's probably what is for sure happening, but back to tea leaves and lets see if we can salvage this shit before I lose the last 2 people who might be still reading. Here is what we're looking at right now. We jumped back over the 2008 bottom to retest the top of the 10yr yield channel about 6 years earlier then expected (2000-1994=6... fuck). Assuming fairy's are real and yields need to drop to make sure Peter Pan never grows up and becomes Robin Williams, JPOW won't flinch, the dollar and bonds will rally and we will get our tasty black Monday scenario which based on the head and shoulders on the crystal ball that we saw Spy is expecting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q3ew9g4z4up81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1c33d8f52922254e2885bdac66722b1790f7f47\n\nLast thing, lets see what some BLK equivalent looked like in 1994 to see if there's any more hope for my ever increasingly OTM puts.

This write up is as long as the Batman movie so I have added my slideshow so you can stare at pictures:\n\n[**Slideshow**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zdqTj74oDrV1bROrN3GGKvLRYD8lFKlE/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=114395166790266874172&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)\n\n"All Sales have an expiration date."\n\nAlibaba is a complex business that we cannot pitch on a page. We became interested in BABA around\xa0**$210 a share**\xa0and researched the stock for the past six months. As of Tuesday, we believe a unique situation occurred that turned a great opportunity into an amazing opportunity.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAlibaba (NYSE: BABA) is one of the highest-quality businesses globally, maintaining a historical return on capital of roughly 18%, owning numerous subsidiaries and cross-holdings. The business is broken into five business segments: commerce, cloud, media and entertainment, innovation, and cross-holdings (87%, 8%, 4%, 1% of revenue) {cross holdings market value equalled 36% of BABA market cap.}. Although people recognize Alibaba as the Chinese Amazon, it is more like Google because they make more money from adverting on their sites rather than selling products.\xa0\n\nAs of March 15, 2022, Alibaba traded at:\n\n* **4.81x P/E (Minority Holdings, Cash, and ST investments removed)** \n* FP/E (with cash and ST investments) = 11.2\n* ROC = 14%\n* Market Cap = 294B\n* TEV = 224.5B\n* P/B = 1.73\n* FCF Yield = 26.2%\n* Price to FCF = 6.73\n* ROE = 15.52%\n\nBABA is expected to grow:\n\n* revenues by 32% in next two years\n* earnings by 30.7% in the next two years\n\nIn the past seven years, BABA grew:\n\n* Revenues (per share) by 894.9%\n* Cash Flow (per share) by 559.5%\n* Earnings (per share) by 601.9%\n* The share price has changed by 0%\xa0\n\nRecent fears have led to a 70% sell-off, tanking the market cap to a low of 196 billion dollars. Pessimism is at an all-time high; an analyst (I\'ll be nice and not use his name) gave a price target of $65 where nearly a year ago it was north of $300. Nothing has fundamentally changed, and the most considerable risk is China (this was why he downgraded); it is not a new risk... he is a lunatic. This example shows the fear that analysts are jumping ship when signs of change are evident.\n\nA large MOAT protects Alibaba, and its cloud business has the potential to grow bigger than its current market cap alone. People are acting as China has never probed or cracked down on equities before. The core business has grown efficiently throughout enormous fines and regulations. The past year has been challenging for Alibaba; no other way to put it. Nevertheless, BABA still delivered 14.4% ROC and solid top and bottom-line growth. Removing fines and regulations, Alibaba had an outstanding year. Organic growth will continue and provide above-market returns shortly.\n\nRecord low multiples and continual growth through the most challenging market should be highly enticing to investors.\xa0\n\n**Thesis:**\n\n1. The most significant risk (CHINA) is overblown. Understanding the two central policies by the Chinese governments allows a better understanding of their crackdown and recent actions. This week the catalyst was finally given by the CCP stepping in to help boost the equity markets.\n2. The underlying business will continue to grow double-digit revenues and earnings for the considerable future. The MOAT of their Cloud delivers growth for the next decade. The commerce portion is competitively positioned to take a significant share in the international market.\n3. The valuation is Ludacris!!!!!!\xa0\n4. Tuesday announcement creates liquidity and buy-side pressure that has never been possible. Allowing banks, insurance companies, and underwriters to own more stock in China develops an unchartered situation and will likely deliver outsized gains.\n\n**Risks and Mitigants**\n\nStarting with the risks we believe is helpful for readers, most people know about the company and why to be bullish; however, we have not seen anyone dive into China to explain the explicit risk and why we believe it is far overblown.\n\nChina\'s risk is mainly due to the recent actions taken by the CCP and Xi Jinping. Timeline of events:\n\n* 2.8 billion Dollar Antitrust Fine against Alibaba\n* DIDI Removed from AppStore\n* Tutoring stocks become non-profit\n* Alibaba pledges 15.5 billion to shared Prosperity\n* DIDI Delisting announcement\n* Evergrande Defaults\n\nUS investors flooded out of Chinese equities; however, we do not believe that any of these actions were unexpected but predictable. The Chinese communist party has two main focuses Common Prosperity and Dual Circulation. As a result, the sentiment is at all-time lows, and many believe China is uninvestable. On the contrary, we believe China is highly investable and delivers the best bargain in the entire market with Alibaba.\n\nCommon Prosperity:\n\nIt is the goal of creating a vast middle class and reducing the poverty levels in China. They try to do this by focusing on areas where citizens either overspend or struggle to obtain services. For example, a massive market surprise was that they turned for-profit tutoring non-profit. That announcement created enormous amounts of fear in the equity markets. This occurred because the goal was to offer tutoring to all students, not just those that could afford tutoring services. It makes sense that they do this because limiting education will create a wide disparity between the upper class and lower class.\xa0\n\nTo understand how the government acts, you must understand the goals of their policies. Ray Dalio made a good analogy; think of the CCP as strict parents; they want the "best" for you and sometimes overshoot trying to achieve that before realizing they have gone too far.\n\nWe are not fearful of crackdowns because of historical events. The most recent crackdown occurred in 2018 when there was a probe on video game companies. Initially, the CCP claimed that video games were going to be banned... As a result, investors fled out of these equities, and fear was extreme in Chinese equities. They still have video games today. A key to understand is that the CCP has historical evidence that they overshoot with regulations in the short term and during the intermediate to a long time ease the rules greatly.\xa0\n\nperformance of Videogame stocks:\n\n* Tencent (-37%) went on to rally 150%\xa0\n* NetEase (-41%) went on to rally 165%\n\nAlibaba will benefit over time from Common Prosperity, delivering uncommon returns. They have pledged 15.5 billion, and a larger middle class will create wallet expansion, directly providing more revenue and profit to Alibaba.\xa0\n\nA quick note on DIDI is that we believe that they were rightfully delisted. They had 30+ violations before IPO and did not address these issues by national security. If this occurred in the US likely, the company is not even allowed to delist. In recent news, a Chinese official explicitly stated that they support IPOs abroad.\xa0\n\nDual Circulation:\n\nThe CCP\'s second goal is dual circulation. They are working on improving their internal economy while participating in global trade to double GDP by 2035. Hindering your superpowers (Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu) and causing fear will not lead to goals being met. We have seen their policies and actions show that they have realized they have overshot with their regulations, and we believe will aid in the recovery. March 17, 2022, regulators in china said help is coming, tech regulations are nearing an end, and they will buy stocks while improving monetary policies while the rest of the world is tightening policies. This is a critical point that many investors overlook; there is a very low probability of actual harm in Chinese equities any further. The fear is overdone, and this slow bleed-out is over.\xa0\n\nUnderstanding that to double their economy, they need companies like Alibaba to succeed because they are the most prominent Chinese company with access to international markets and will dramatically improve exports and manufacturing. The global market will be a direct player in the success of China, they need the world, and the world needs China. So there is no way around not having Alibaba in the mix.\n\nRecently China has been buying planes from Boeing, which could signify they are excited to work with America rather than fight them. This is one example. Nevertheless, there are countless other "uncharacteristic" outreaches towards better trade. Investors must overlook the media talking points, as they are inaccurate. The actions are louder than words.\n\nWe do not believe that Zero-covid nor Evergrande is significant enough of a real risk to the Alibaba thesis. Evergrande default debt is in their currency (Yen), so it is manageable, and the government is stepping in and aiding in the situation. During the Evergrande announcement, Alibaba acquired a small 8-billion-dollar chip manufactured at a ridiculously cheap valuation, which is a positive. Zero-covid will likely be easing over the coming months, and we are confident that the end is near with the pandemic. This will result in another bullish outlook in China.\n\nStatistical Analysis of China:\n\nA statistical piece of evidence regards the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, where The Hang Seng index has rallied 24% leading up to the national congress party. This is based on 5 data points (1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, 2017). Going into the Chinese "election," the last thing you want is a suffering economy and the hyper-wealthy to be upset with you.\xa0\n\nPost-market recession, the MSCI ETF has returned 31% in the following 12 months. Alibaba, we believe, will outpace the ETF over the short and long-term, yielding much more substantial than 31% returns over the coming 12 months.\n\nThe Hang Seng index has traded below book four times in history, and Alibaba has doubled the Hang Seng each of those times. Instances Hang Seng fell below book.\xa0\n\nHang Seng Recovery after trading below book:\n\n* 2016: 85% in 23 Months\xa0\n* 2020: 35% in 11 Months\n\nAlibaba during the same time:\n\n* 2016: 234%\xa0\n* 2020: 71%\xa0\n\n**Analysis of Business:**\n\nBABA is broken into five businesses, and only three are worth talking about. Media entertainment and innovation are tiny and do not move the needle. The commerce, cloud, and cross holdings are the most critical aspects to this company.\xa0\n\nCommerce:\n\nMaking up 87% of revenue and delivering most of the profit growing at a 34% Revenue CAGR over the past seven years demonstrates the power of this Chinese Giant. Many people compare commerce to Amazon, and we do not think this is a good comparison for investors. The stores operate similarly, but most revenues come from the sellers paying for push ads like seen in Google. This is how BABA can maintain such strong margins. They also have very successful logistics services that improve delivery times and efficiency. For example, one of their subsidiaries, Cainiao, is 2x more efficient than a regular warehouse. Growth in china retail is slowing. However, they will continue to grow and maintain a robust bottom line for the foreseen future.\n\nChinese commerce growth is not the best reason for investors to like the commerce portion. They should be excited over the international growth potential. This is where the enormous market potential lies. The three notable names are Trendyol, AliExpress, and Lazada. A good reference is that the TAM for Chinese retail is only growing by 26% over the next five years, whereas the international retail market will grow 66%.\n\nFirst Trendyol is their Turkish subsidy that is competing well against Hepsbiruda. Second, the Lira is finally stabilizing (We believe the worst inflation in Turkey is now over), and the bottom line should instantly improve. Third, they are growing and collecting insightful data that will transition into the rest of the middle east. Finally, being a market leader with only 12% penetration shows the vast market growth potential. The middle east is a largely untapped market, and we believe that the new users can result in ample opportunities soon. Researching MOMO (Smallfish42 had a good write-up if interested) delivered valuable insight; they plan to expand into the Mena region. These regions are not first-world countries but are the fastest growing youngest population globally. By the time the core of their population is in the 25–35-year-old range, phones and technology will substantially advance, and infrastructure will be in place. This would, in simple terms, argue that companies like MOMO (TANTAN in particular) and Trendyol are being undervalued mainly because of the favourable demographics. We strongly believe that Trendyol will be able to take significant advantage of the location, whereas companies like Amazon are not having as much success.\n\nTo further the bull case for Trendyol is the Google model. Unlike Amazon having tight margins, countries that will not spend as frequently as fully developed countries will keep their margins even thinner. Alibaba makes money off advertisers, which are more insulated to purchase frequencies.\n\nLazada is the southeast Asian version that has done much better than expected and has grown its penetration and top line for countless quarters. Revenue rose 43% YOY, consumer stickiness has improved for seven straight quarters, and an assortment of products is now being rolled out. With 11% penetration, we believe this will likely deliver strong growth for the next 2-4 years.\n\nLazada will continue to improve penetration, and we believe that the quality of consumers they are obtaining and will obtain will become vastly profitable. Many analysts thought entering southeast Asia was an enormous risk with minimal possibility of success. The contrary has occurred and will continue.\xa0\n\nThe most exciting out of the three is AliExpress. We believe this has the most opportunity and is an immense opportunity for growth in the commerce section. AliExpress grew their sellers on site by 132% last year. This allows investors to see that buyers are on the other end if sellers are aggressively coming. They hold two huge advantages and the first being pricing power. First, they can go right at Amazon in international competition due to connecting to many manufacturers. Next, their brand recognition is significant in the global market.\n\nAs noted by Jeffery Towson via China Market Research: "AliExpress is effectively Alibaba at its most opportunistic." we strongly agree with this statement. AliExpress will begin worldwide shipping in 72 hours for a $3 monthly subscription, and there is 0 competition at that price point. No one… not even Amazon; their premium costs nearly $30+ for a monthly subscription in some parts of the world. We believe this value proposition will create an even large MOAT over the coming years. Their cash balance can support the price.\xa0\n\nAlibaba is focused on the long term, this is something that management preaches, and we believe it is imperative. They are concentrated in the year 2036 to reach their goals, and they have a track record of creating enormous value over time. Their long-term vision gives management of subsidies to operate without forcing rapid growth and making educated long term decisions. An example is Freshippo. In 5 years, they were able to reach a 10-billion-dollar valuation. They are slowly and efficiently growing the company to a valuation where they now hope to take it public.\n\nAlibaba has focused on spending large amounts of Capex to improve their international markets exposure because they realize they have the infrastructure and ability to dominate over every potential competitor. An example is that Amazon has spent enormous amounts on planes and trucks, whereas Alibaba has spent on Wearhouse efficiency, nearly fully automating Cainiao factories. Another area is self-delivering vehicles that are 1/3 of the cost and 40% quicker at delivering the last mile.\xa0\n\nThe critical takeaway is that TMALL and Taobao are great. They are reaching mature cycles, and the transition by management has been fantastic. They have improved consumer stickiness by 1.8x while growing their loyalty programs by 50%; these we believe are key with significant competition growing with JD,.com (NYSE: JD) and Pindupduo (NYSE: PDD). This demonstrates the value proposals the customers are accepting.\xa0\n\nThe value expansion and growth will slow dramatically in the two flagship Chinese commerce stores, and investors should not worry or use these two businesses to base earnings. The new growing markets are not in China. They are global. BABA has positioned itself well to compete and dominate, taking market share. TMALL and Taobao will continue to deliver, but multiple expansions will occur from Lazada, Trendyol, and AliExpress growth prospects.\xa0\n\nCloud:\n\nThe single best reason to invest in Alibaba is the cloud space. Alibaba controls 38% of the Chinese cloud market share. They have an enormous advantage, like AWS in America. The cloud is nearly non-existent in terms of earnings and has a considerable potential to be a primary driver of profits in the future. Operating margin expansion will grow to a minimum of 30%. This will further enrichen their margins and ROC.\n\nAmazon states their cloud operating margins at 30%, but they misrepresent this by inputting their internal cloud costs. We computed a 34% operating margin and believe that they will continue to improve their operations. This is something that many analysts seem to miss. Maybe this is what our good friend at JPM skipped over when he delivered a $65 PT... or perhaps he just missed everything. We believe that Alicloud is a very close comparison to AWS. They both have substantial market share and operate similarly.\n\nThe Chinese cloud market is poised to grow quicker than the global cloud market by 16%. As a result, China\'s cloud at one point will likely make up close to 1% of their GDP, and currently, it makes up 0.1%.\xa0\n\nThe cloud market is multiplying and will likely occur in China on a lagged basis. The CCP and governments will need cloud, companies and organizations will begin to use cloud software. We are very bullish on the cloud industry and believe Alibaba is the cheapest way to make a significant play on cloud software. Alicloud is going to deliver continual growth by improving the underlying service. As they improve the software, they are not hiking the costs. We believe this is the correct move with such market dominance by managing to begin to take market share and grow in international markets. In addition, Alibaba has already started to develop in-house microchips, which will cut their cost significantly and deliver less dependence on chip manufacturers. This will allow more cloud data to be used while spending less on their hardware costs to maintain the cloud without outages.\n\nCross Holdings:\n\nThe final aspect of the business analysis is the cross-holdings. Their current market value equals 70 billion dollars. Doing valuations for each allows understanding the quality businesses that Alibaba finds and backs financially. This delivers good insight into how management thinks and how they will likely spend money in the future.\n\nThe list of companies we did total DCF Valuations for include:\n\n\\- Hello Group Inc.\n\n\\- Bili Bili\n\n\\- smart\n\n\\- Mango Excellent\n\n\\- STO Express\n\n\\- YTO Express\n\n\\- ZTO Express\n\n\\- Red Star\n\n\\- Focus Media\n\n\\- Ant Financial\n\nIt became evident that Alibaba has some interesting investments. The express companies are all logistic companies that operate in Asia. Many of the companies are not attempts at unicorns but highly stable and predictable businesses that will be of benefit to Alibaba. Management seems to favor quality and insight over promised money tomorrow (high multiple stocks).\n\n**Microsoft Comparison:**\n\nHistory does not repeat, but it sure does rhyme.\xa0\n\nMicrosoft from 2006-2013:\n\n\\- Revenues grew 112%\n\n\\- Earnings grew 121%\n\n\\- Cash flow grew 193%\n\n· During the same time, the share price did not change. The combination of the weakened valuations and strong buybacks (2010 mega-caps like AAPL, MSFT, SBUX… used buybacks to try and elevate very compressed valuations) founded an enormous market rally.\xa0\n\nMicrosoft from 2013-2020 rallied 1500% with multiple readjustments and continual value creation.\n\nAlibaba from 2013-2021\n\n\\- Revenues grew by 894%\n\n\\- Earnings grew by 602%\n\n\\- Cash flow grew by 559%\n\nDuring this timeshare, the price has not changed. Investors can buy Alibaba at 2013 prices with 6x improved fundamentals. Alibaba has issued a 15-billion-dollar buyback program. They currently have 7 billion (estimate) left to spend on buybacks.\n\nWe added this comparison just to demonstrate how times of worry and lacklustre results create far above-average returns over the coming years. Of course, we understand that the underlying businesses are different, and MSFT never was forced to deal with an extensive regulation. However, these situations are similar where they were trading at absurdly cheap valuations and issued large buyback programs.\n\n**Valuation:**\n\nWith very different businesses within Alibaba, we used a SOTP valuation. There are three good comps (Amazon, JD.com, and Pinduoduo), and the others (Tencent, Baidu, Coupa, Snowflake, Google, Microsoft) operate in one of the key business segments to BABA. We valued each minority holding and added it back and removed majority holdings to the proper percent of ownership.\n\nHistorically Alibaba has traded on a yearly avg. Price to an earnings range of 24-33x, the median is 29, and the mean is 28.33.\n\nRelative Valuation:\n\nThe three main competitors (JD, PDD, and AMZN) are not nearly as cheap as Alibaba… Alibaba performs better in each category (Unadjusted TTM P/E, Unadjusted NTM P/E, EV EBITDA, EV/REV, OP. MARGIN) aside from EV/REV, which JD.com was cheaper. Considering that JD.com\'s operating margin does not compete with Alibaba, so they are forced to sell more to yield the same dollar value.\n\nDCF:\n\nSince we cannot add charts or tables in applications, I will briefly walk through the SOTP valuation. We used a model like Aswath Damadoran and do not use exit multiples but calculate for "infinite growth."\n\nCommerce:\xa0we believe that the predictability is still at large. In the most recent quarter, earnings grew by 10%. However, guidance was not changed, and their goal is 20-23%. We believe that this is more than doable; the government interference will be at lows for the first time in 12 months. We believe that the value creation will combine the growth of the international subsidies with improving top-line overcoming three years, while Tmall and Taobao deliver larger margins as they mature and minimize spending.\n\nCloud:\xa0the continual growth will occur at double digits for nearly next decade, the addressable market is massive and being top four globally and number in China holding 38% of market share. We believe that the real growth occurs when non-tech companies transition to cloud software needs, this will create an even bigger market and deliver higher margins because needs will be less than the current users, most big tech companies. The margins we believe can grow north of 30% operating margins.\n\nCross holdings:\xa0We believe the intrinsic value is near 120 billion dollars. They have seeded some highly successful stocks and others who operated very effectively in their respective regions. For example, they own profitable shipping and logistics companies in Asia.\n\nAnt Financial is a big area where nearly 50 billion is locked up until the IPO; we believe that regulators are not overstepping because Alipay and Ant are primarily connected to the Chinese consumer credit and need to have an infrastructure in place before going public. This is a catalyst and is currently, in our opinion, the same as restricted cash. Many investors believe that the Ant IPO will reach 300-500 billion valuations. We believe this is mainly steep. However, we can imagine American investors would essentially like to invest, creating overvaluation.\n\nSimplistic base case:\n\nAlibaba will not be as affected as the market believes by the government delivering a valuation that likely trades at a PEG near 0.15. This is paying nearly nothing for future growth. We believe that Alibaba will continue to grow in the international and Chinese markets. The cloud will become to impact earnings materially over the coming years. The market is so pessimistic that when Alibaba turns around, there will be enormous margin expansion to the mean. We value Alibaba on a SOTP valuation of **$303.41**. Based on our analysis, Alibaba cross-holdings will not grow materially over the coming years, growing 6.4% a year. We believe this is mainly conservative and delivers\xa0**even more**\xa0safety in buying the stock. The float is being bought in aggressively, making the valuation much higher over the coming quarters and years. The return on capital and FCF yield will begin to grow along with the growth of the cloud business.\n\nAnalyst Accuracy:\n\nAnalysts have been largely inaccurate, especially struggling in times of crackdowns. The data goes back to the fourth quarter of 2014. Overall, BABA earnings have outperformed analyst expectations by 6% over the past eight years. Analysts have struggled to create price targets during crackdowns. BABA has beat 17 earnings and missed 11, with nine being related to crackdowns. This demonstrates that when the air clears, Alibaba will likely return to exceeding expectations and reverting to the mean of 6% avg. Beats.\n\nThe average price target for Alibaba is $159.36, which we believe is fundamentally cheap, and the analysts have shown to consistently change price targets related to fear or greed in the market. Looking at many of the recommendations seems to be a contrary indicator. This low-price target represents 40%+ upside. This is a considerable margin for safety, especially with our 303-dollar price target.\n\n**Buyback:**\n\nAlibaba issued a 15-billion-dollar buyback and has 7 billion dollars remaining. We estimate that by the time they have fully utilized their buyback, they will have reduced the shares outstanding by 5-8%. This is a meaningful buyback that will deliver enormous benefits to shareholders; they will be able to continue to buy their float in for the coming years.\n\n**Moat:**\n\n\xa0Alibaba operates a defensible MOAT. They have brand loyalty and have been improving consumer repeats. They have years of data over competitors and have shown to understand wallet expansion better and position themselves to capitalize on these consumers over competitors.\n\nThe next defence is pricing power. Compared to Amazon in the international battle, there is an enormous discount in pricing power. Therefore, unlike America, they can compete on price in international fighting, which is much more critical in these global markets. Moreover, the power of their manufacturing connections delivers enormous possibilities to take market share based on pricing. This will hold off local companies.\n\n**Special situation:**\n\nWe believe that this week delivered an enormous opportunity for all Chinese equities. I have seen the countless write-ups on Alibaba and was hesitant to write however with the news from Tuesday I believe I was obligated to write this report. As stated in the State Council address of the public that the tech cramdown was nearing an end, they will support tech and housing companies, stimulate their economies using monetary policies and new loans, and state the insurance companies increase their exposure to stocks.\n\nThis news, we believe, is a special situation because of the effects that will directly help Alibaba. This will likely deliver enormous amounts of support to Alibaba price and may change market sentiment (the main reason for the plumet).\n\nEnding of crackdown:\n\nThe government realizes they have overstepped in their actions. Deciding to turn tutoring non-profit laid off nearly three hundred thousand people, and after the cuts from tech companies, a million-plus Chinese citizen will likely be out of work due to regulations. They have realized that time to ease restrictions is needed. Looking back to Common Prosperity, this makes sense; laying off a million people creates large amounts of poverty.\n\nSupport of the economy:\n\nThe monetary policies will include stimulus, and they will not expand property tax. This is very exciting for two reasons. The first is that monetary stimulus equals higher spending, and being directly affected by weak Chinese consumer spending (recent quarters) will likely reverse and deliver strong sales over the year. Alibaba will likely re-capture the sales missed in Q1 by weak consumer spending. This is another bullish indicator to point to the company\'s 20-23% expectations to be accurate. The following reason that this will benefit Alibaba is that the property tax will aid home builders and the Evergrande situation. Many new developers will begin as they will not have to deal with higher tax expenses. This also shows that communism and capitalism can co-exist (this is one of the largest reasons to be a BABA bear); holding taxes relatively low is more of a capitalist approach. They are also issuing new loans that will directly be pumped into their economy, benefiting their dual circulation system strengthening Alibaba\'s domestic sales. This will correlate easily to the bottom line and deliver almost 30% FCF for investors.\n\nInsurance:\n\n"China\'s banking regulator said that it would support insurance companies to increase investment in stock markets." The insurance regulator stated that trusts and wealth management would be asked (by communist gov, which means do!) to support and stabilize capital markets. The stock investments made by these entities will likely be a benefactor to Alibaba. In addition, many of the investors and insurance companies will probably invest in the highest quality large cap. companies to "mitigate risk" This will deliver liquidity and buy-side pressure that has rarely, if ever, been this present.\n\nDelisting and accounting:\n\nThe state continued to discuss how good progress between American and Chinese governments has been working on improving transparency in the accounting of Chinese equities. This is spectacular news as this will likely bring trust from foreign investors and deliver more liquidity from investors who were primarily feared of delisting due to the inaction of the Chinese government\n\n**Other risks:**\n\nRussia-Ukraine War:\n\nThis seems to be the one thing that still possess fundamental risk to Alibaba. We do not think that Alibaba is the only stock at risk because every company faces direct geo political risk regarding the Russia Ukraine war.\n\nI do not hold a position with the issuer such as employment, directorship, or consultancy.  \nI and/or others I advise hold a material investment in the issuer\'s securities.'), ('GOOGL 20/1 split.

OG's know this is what drove the first GME Sneeze.Hi everyone,\n\n*First of all this is not financial advice, I'm retarded, this is an individual opinion and is just me sharing some data I found, I am an individual investor.*\n\nSo let's start with the TLDR,\n\n***TL;DR*** \\- Ortex lists historical, daily information on loans. This includes new loans opened per day and loans returned per day. I totaled these numbers and determined that since end of 2017, there have been *71,119,269* more shares loaned than returned. Yes, **71,119,269**.\n\n***TA;DR*** \\- According to data ape can easily see, banana sellers still need to return **71,119,269** bananas.\n\nOkay, the explanation and my methodology, which you can do yourself quite easily:\n\nI'm gonna skip over how I think GME stock movements have always been a result of share lending metrics (new loans, returned loans, CTB) and how derivatives are just a way to cover this up/hedge/suppress it, and go straight to my point.\n\nI noticed that new loans opened per day is almost always greater than new loans returned per day, except for a few key periods such as the January sneeze. So, I went to Ortex, tracked **new shares LOANED per day** vs. **loaned shares RETURNED per day**, exported to CSV, calculated the difference (new shares - returned shares) and totaled since 2017. The number that came out was **71,119,269.** That is **71,119,269** shares that have been loaned but not returned.\n\nDoes this mean that they have to buy 71,119,269 shares? I'm not sure, maybe these were fulfilled with some other method, maybe it was fuckery, I don't know.\n\n*Here are some pictures to illustrate what I did, and also a few key observations.*\n\n# New Loans often exceeds returned loans, except in key periods where the stock goes up, a LOT.\n\n[Please note that the left axis is displayed as a percentile but the green line actually tracks # shares, same as the black line.

Even in periods of price increase such as September 2020 - December 2020, new loans exceed returned loans; shorters are shorting into price increases.\n\nHowever, rarely, such as the period from Dec 2020 - Jan 2021, returned loans exceed new loans. These result in meteoric price increases.\n\n# How about right now? Is this big spike caused by returned loans?\n\n**Short answer; No.**\n\n[Nov 2021 - Now](https://preview.redd.it/v4rho73nt9q81.png?width=1042&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad749fb734eab6b9803eb40bcdf8656f371eb689)\n\nAs you can see, new loans have continuously exceeded returned loans. We have yet to see a period where loans are returned such as January 2021. Indeed, shorts have CONTINUED TO SHORT into this huge price increase.\n\n# What about those price increases in 2021? The cycles?\n\nYes, it played a factor, but not by much.\n\nI went ahead and calculated the net shares returned - net shares loaned during several important runup dates. The resulting data is listed below.\n\n**2/24 - 3/10:** *2,016,186* shares were *returned* during this period. Interestingly, on 2/25, 3,021,665 shares were loaned and only 152,499 shares were returned.\n\n**5/11 - 6/9**: *352,206* were LENT *during* this period. Yes, 352,206 shares were lent during this runup from 137 to 300, meaning it was not a result of returned shares.\n\n**8/20 - 9/1**: *185,878* shares were *returned* during this august runup.\n\n**10/25-11/23**: *1,105,735* shares were *returned* during the november runup.\n\nSo, the lending plays a role in these runups, but not always in the direction one would expect and possibly insignificant to the volume that actually occurs during the runups.\n\n# How many shares were returned during the January sneeze?\n\nI mentioned before that January 2021 was one period in which shares returned did in fact exceed shares loaned. By how much?\n\nDuring the period of January 13 to January 29, *31,491,180* more shares were returned than loaned. Indeed, you can say that January was indeed driven by these loan metrics, at least a good portion of it.\n\n**To illustrate this, I have made a chart of loans outstanding over time** Higher y axis means more shares loaned, if it goes down, that means they are returning shares).\n\n[\\(Y axis = shares on loan, X axis = date\\) Higher y axis means more shares loaned, if it goes down, that means they returned shares\\).](https://preview.redd.it/v9jcgsjpt9q81.png?width=1183&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f9fa0c2c3eaa6c9ab09671a12f2444ba2a7506b)\n\nAs you can see, about 20 million more shares have been lent since 11/23. Bear trap?\n\n*Please* draw your own conclusions from this. I am simply sharing data that is available from an open source (free trial at least, via. Ortex). All I will say is that there is 71 million shares lent, 75.9 million shares outstanding, and a float of 62.48 million shares. Do note that outstanding loans began to rise around when Cone Poo Chair really caught on. Interesting.\n\n***Once again, this is not financial advice, I am a retard.***\n\nEdit 1:\n\nSomeone recommended I use a non memestock as a control to make sure ortex's data is not flawed overall. I am currently working on this data for AAPL and will post shortly\n\nEdit 2: Repeating this methodology on AAPL gives a result of 81,421,801. With a float of 16.31 billion shares, that means that 0.49% of the float is currently lent. Reported short interest of AAPL is 0.68% which means that this methodology is actually UNDERESTIMATING outstanding shorts according to AAPL as a control.\n\nEdit 3: Chart for AAPL:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6e9r9rlqt9q81.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=364ed7b7561a88702cb92b027d0753aa89761489"), ('Russian Invasion is Bullish for TSLA', 'Russian Invasion is Bullish for TSLARussian invasion is bullish for Tesla - as gas prices rises and continues to stay elevated, more and more consumers will opt to purchase an EV as it is seen as a more economically viable option than buying an ICE vehicle and having to pay for the insane gas prices just to fuel their vehicle.

What happened yesterday was the extreme example of what the darkpools have been doing over the past year to control stock price.  Simply stated, the manipulation of order flow through the darkpool gives them the ability to do virtually anything they want with the stock price including preventing stocks from squeezing if they so choose.  Let me explain how this is done.  \n\n**Claim #1 - Market price is dictated by the orders that hit the market.**  Seems simple enough right?  Well, its not quite that simple, so let me expand a bit to be complete.  Limit orders are placed for both bids or asks which builds up the book.  Generally the book is pretty even, but sometimes the book gets stacked on one side which creates large resistance or support at a particular level.  Then someone initiates the trade with a market buy or sell order.  This matches with the top order on the book and is executed.  In an equally stacked book, price will follow the volume of who initiates the trade (buyers or sellers).  To show an example of this, lets look at AAPL price movement on 3/23.  \n\n[Figure 1 - $AAPL Price movement 3\\/23](https://preview.redd.it/6gph8zsrniq81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f3b2d87820563e5a698909389ed0af47876217)\n\nIn this example, what I have done is categorized all of the trades as being initiated by buyer or seller based on the price of the trade (is it at the ask, bid, closer to the ask or the bid, or directly in the middle). \n\n* Graph #1 shows the average price for the day and how this is moving by the minute.  \n* Graph #2 shows the cumulative buy-sell trade volume for trades that hit the lit market (yellow) and trades that hit the darkpool.  As you can see, the price movement follows this pattern of overall volume of trades initiated. \n* Graph #3 shows percentages of darkpool serviced trades according to whether the trade was a buy or a sell.\n* Graph #4 shows volume of trades according to buy or sell across darkpools and the lit market. \n\nThis is a pretty ordinary and unbiased trading day for $AAPL.  \n\n**Claim #2 - Darkpools and PFOF allow the MM to control the price when they want to.**  OK, we all say this, but I will show you the data of how this is done.  Nowadays, almost all orders from brokers will first be sent to the darkpool.  If you want to see how your broker does this, look up 605 and 606 reports that are publicly available.  Essentially what this means is that the order is first serviced by the darkpool and then the darkpool will initiate a market trade to acquire those shares.  This is done in fractions of a millisecond.  This is also why you will see on a normal day, the darkpool generally will service about 50% of the trades.  However, this gives the MM a huge advantage on price movement.  In essence, if the market maker can temporarily go long or short on a stock, they can bias the price in a particular direction.   \n\n[Figure 2 - $BBIG Price movement 2\\/23](https://preview.redd.it/bt5qwt8aqiq81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8747a25fc629663ee49eef4a7a0ff73cbd2bfda4)\n\n* In this example, the orders hitting the darkpool are still biased toward the buy initiated side.  The green line on the second chart shows the trend of this. By the end of the day, the darkpool had around 500K more buy initiated trades than sell initiated trades. \n* At 10;20, you will notice that the lit market buy vs sell trades starts deviating from the general trend of the darkpool.  At this moment, the darkpool is getting more buys than sells but is not reflecting them into  the lit market.  They are effectively going short of the stock at this point.  \n* You will see that the price of the stock follows the trend of what is hitting the lit markets.  \n* By the end of the day, there is a difference of about 1M shares between the darkpool and the lit market.  \n\n**Claim #3 - When something runs the direction against where the MM wants, the MM will effectively shut off the buy or sell button.**  This gets me to the explanation of what happened on 3/29 for $AMC.  Because orders are first hitting the darkpool and the MM has control of where and when to acquire or sell that stock, they can effectively control the price.  \n\n[Figure 3 - $AMC price movement 3\\/29](https://preview.redd.it/0dverm49siq81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81cc011fb4fad2bf13da2b8e8a81b2e6e5e48676)\n\n* On 3/29, there was a huge influx of buy initiated trades right at the open.  This caused the price to skyrocket immediately.  You can see this in the yellow line around 9:30. \n* Then there was a huge sell order (presumably short) that hit the lit market around 9:37.  This caused a downside halt.  Who and why this was done is pure speculation, but my theory is that it was done to kill the rally and allow the MM to reset their algorithms on AMC. \n* From this point on, the market maker is not reflecting all buy orders into the lit market.  They dont have to kill all of the buy orders, just enough to cause the net of this to trend towards the sell side.  \n* From 9:37 on, the darkpool is effectively going short on $AMC. \n* Net buy orders are still coming in for $AMC and this is seen by the green line on graph 2 continuing to go up.\n* Lit market buy vs sell trend is now biased toward the sell side and the price stabilizes.\n* In the 11am hour timeframe momentum is fully killed and flattens out (green line)\n* Darkpool still biases the trades hitting the lit market toward sell (my suspicion is that the bid side of the book was stacked higher than the ask side which prevented further drops).\n\n**This is how the darkpool effectively turns off the buy button without turning off the buy button.  They just control enough of the trades to make the balance level off.**  \n\nThis is done every day by the market makers and is coded into their algorithms.  Ever wonder why all the stocks tend to follow the same patterns?  Its because the darkpool is managing the stock price of a lot of these together.  If you actually looked at the actual trade order flow they may be drastically different for two stocks that are trending together.  All the price movement is being managed by the market maker.  \n\nSo what can we learn from this?  Well, effectively to do this the market maker must go long or short on a stock for a period of time.  They do this knowing that if they kill the momentum, the natural volume on one side or the other will die off and then they can equal out their position.  If it gets too unbalanced, then the system falls apart.'), ('AMD is 12B market cap away from being larger than Intel.', 'AMD is 12B market cap away from being larger than Intel.What are your predictions in the event that AMD becomes larger than Intel?

If they keep their current growth up, they'll reach Tesla's current deliveries within 5 years.\n\nOk so now I'll be showing why NIO is underpriced through a small comparison with Tesla, if you think Tesla is overpriced. Click away this post since it'll be a pointless read. (I do agree that Tesla is overpriced at it's current profits, however their future profit potential makes up for it.)\n\nWell the comparison is simple really. If NIO has a market cap of 36B at 91K deliveries. And Tesla has a market cap of 1.146T at 936K deliveries u could translate that into NIO deserving a market cap around 1/10th of Tesla's. This would be something around 90-120B. This leads me to believe that NIO is currently selling at 1/3rd-1/4th of it's true value.\n\nNow as to why it's rallying today, is all due to the promising future it shows and more light being shined upon it today. Especially after new came out thatt Ark Invest's (60B asset value) CEO Cathie Woods sold 146.000 TSLA shares on the 25th of march and, bought 420.057 shares of NIO on the same day. Meaning they dropped some of their Tesla stocks for the booming NIO stock.\n\nOne of the main reasons that NIO is so cheap right now is due to distrust in China, however if you don't experience that and have trust in the EV future and companies such as Tesla, Nio is a ridiculously cheap stock right now with an analyst price target around $40-50 and high estimates of $90.\n\nSources:   [NIO Inc.

But How Scary?', 'It’s Scary How Dominant Apple Has Become. But How Scary?[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/opinion/apple-coda-oscar.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/opinion/apple-coda-oscar.html)\n\nHow big of a deal is it that a film from Apple, founded as a computer company, just won three Academy Awards, including one for best picture? If you’re among those worried about the inescapable economic, political and cultural dominance of that set of nerdy giants we now call Big Tech, how much greater panic should this induce?\n\nPerhaps none. On its own, the awards-season success of “CODA” — the feel-good film about a deaf family that Apple purchased for its subscription TV service at last year’s Sundance Film Festival — will be immaterial to the company’s very big bottom line. And anyway, Apple is hardly the first corporate interloper to find fortune (or, more often, failure) in showbiz. For decades, [auto-parts companies](http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,949782,00.html), [Canadian liquor magnates](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/20/business/a-new-entertainment-giant-the-seller-the-sun-is-setting-on-seagram-empire.html) and [storied American corporations](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/27/business/media/six-sigma-a-hollywood-studio-learns-the-ge-way.html) have gone to Hollywood in search of lucrative side hustles and brand-enhancing corporate jewels. Sony, whose Walkman was the iPod of its day, got into the entertainment business [way back in 1989](https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-sony-follow-20170116-story.html); now Sony Pictures’ capacious library of films [includes a dozen best picture Oscar winners](https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/divisions.html).\n\nStill, when “CODA” won big on Sunday night, I was struck by a set of complicated insights about this biggest of Big Tech behemoths. And I was again left wondering: As a technological and cultural force, should we be more inclined to celebrate Apple or to fear it?\n\nAmong my epiphanies were the following.\n\nFirst: Boy, Apple sure is executing well these days. As recently as the late 2010s, with the Mac line foundering, its cloud services second-rate and each new iPhone hardly better than the last, Apple had seemed to grow a bit lazy, even boring. In the 2020s it’s shaken off any such malaise. Over the past year, I have been wowed by a parade of Apple products — the [speed of its new Macs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/opinion/apple-microprocessor.html), the cameras and battery life on the latest iPhones, the way new [versions of iPadOS and MacOS have become magically interoperable](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/16/22980566/universal-control-ios-macos-mac-ipad-hands-on), the [way Face ID now works with masks](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22912677/apple-face-id-mask-update-ios-15-4-beta-hands-on-impressions). Nowadays, even Siri is sometimes halfway helpful. The wins for “CODA” and Apple’s streaming success fit that larger story: This is a very well-run company making very good products that customers are willing to spend a lot of money for.\n\nSecond: But a film from Apple becoming the first from a streaming service to win the Oscar for best picture was not just a tale of a well-oiled corporate machine. Apple got into the movie business the way a lot of the tech giants do a lot of things nowadays: It spent gobs of money to win a top spot in a market dominated by much smaller companies, and where money wasn’t enough, it used its advantages as a tech platform to help it along. We first saw this sort of bigfooting with music. [In 2015](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2015/06/08Introducing-Apple-Music-All-The-Ways-You-Love-Music-All-in-One-Place-/), in an effort to compete with Spotify and other music streamers, Apple introduced a [music service that came installed on the iPhone](https://www.macworld.com/article/225730/apple-music-will-dominate-with-the-power-of-the-preinstalled-app.html) and handed out free three-month subscriptions to anyone who wanted one. Early mixed reviews for Apple Music didn’t matter; because it was baked into the device, Apple’s music plan quickly garnered millions of paying users, and today it reportedly has more subscribers than every [rival other than Spotify](https://www.cultofmac.com/764232/apple-music-worlds-second-biggest/).\n\nIn 2019 it did a similar thing with TV. Apple spent a [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/4f7f4326-c2bf-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9) $6 billion on content to start Apple TV+, and it gave away a [free year of the service with the sale of new Apple devices](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-ends-free-promotions-1235009707/). Apple TV+’s lineup was full of sleepers — even “Ted Lasso,” its most beloved show, takes some time to warm up to — but with a built-in audience of every new iPhone, iPad and Mac user, the company could afford to take its time to find its footing before asking people to pay. The success of “CODA” was also a story of Apple’s deep pockets: The $25 million Apple spent on the film’s distribution rights [was a Sundance record](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/05/sundance-apple-coda-streaming-purchase/). According to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-coda-apple-gets-serious-about-the-oscars-11648216800), a veteran awards consultant estimated that Apple spent more than $10 million on the Oscar campaign for “CODA” — more than the film cost to produce.\n\nApple can continue to throw money at its TV service indefinitely; it could easily afford to never make any money from TV+ and simply run the service as a kind of brand-marketing project. The company’s revenue was about $366 billion in fiscal year 2021. Netflix’s revenue last year was just under $30 billion — about 8 percent of Apple’s.\n\nThird: All of this would seem bad — bad in an antitrust, massive-corporations-gobbling-up-everything sort of way. Netflix and Spotify remain thriving companies, but it just does not seem fair or conducive to competition for Apple to leverage its dominance in one market, smartphones, to get ahead in other markets, like the music and movie businesses. It’s especially troublesome when you consider all the onerous rules that Apple imposes on its rivals through its App Store. For instance, it generally takes up to a 30 percent cut of revenue that app makers collect through in-app purchases. Apple’s own apps don’t have to worry about such concerns.\n\nBut again, there are complications here. For one thing, Apple is not, in traditional terms, anything close to a monopoly in the smartphone business. Although analysts believe it makes the [vast bulk of the profits in](https://www.imore.com/apple-takes-75-smartphone-profits-despite-13-market-share-says-report) the smartphone industry, its global market share is on par [with many rivals](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-share/)’. In 2020, Epic Games, the maker of “Fortnite,” [sued Apple](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/opinion/apple-app-store-fortnite-lawsuit.html) to fight the 30 percent commission and other App Store rules. Last year Apple largely won the case. “Given the trial record, the court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws,” a [federal judge ruled](https://www.protocol.com/epic-v-apple-verdict-concludes-apple-is-not-a-monopolist). (Both Apple and Epic are appealing the decision.)\n\nThe other wrinkle is that Apple sometimes uses its market power in ways that are inarguably good for its customers. The most recent example is App Transparency Tracking, [a phenomenal privacy feature](https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/) that Apple added to iPhones and iPads last year. The system cracked down on rampant privacy abuses by the internet advertising industry. Now when you run Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and many other ad-supported iOS apps, Apple requires the apps to get consent from users to collect some of their information for advertising purposes. Surprise: When you force apps to ask users if they want to be tracked, a lot of people decline. Just how many people became apparent in February, when Facebook’s parent company, Meta, said the feature would cost the company [$10 billion in revenue this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html).\n\nI regret to say that after considering the scope of Apple’s power, I’ve arrived at the sort of no-easy-answer muddle that better opinion columnists than me usually try to avoid. But that’s just where we are: Apple, with a valuation of about $3 trillion and firing on every cylinder, seems unstoppable. On the one hand, its market power is scary, and sometimes its ethical and moral compass leaves a lot to be desired. (See [its deference to the Chinese government](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html).)\n\nOn the other hand, it is probably the best-run, most innovative and still most consumer-friendly of the Big Tech baddies.

With the 459.2 double top the bears were able to sink SPY all the way to 456.47 for the low of the day during power hour.

With the VIX being so low the wild swings and moves are going to be less impressive. The best plays I had today were all when the VIX made a big move. That is the best way to play this low volume currently. \n\nApple FINALLY saw a red day! It snapped its longest green streak since 2003 which was 11 days. Closing down a very modest -0.66%. Apple looked incredibly weak intraday today and very much so struggled to get through most resistance. \n\nThe Daily chart looks like we are riding the 8ema wave all the way to ATH.

Of course! The entire basis for active fund management was under attack, and a statement like this made them look not just incompetent, but comically absurd as well.\n\nWhat took the cake was the fact that someone actually tested out Malkiel and ***showed that he might be right!*** In an experiment tracked by [the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB991681622136214659), a monkey picked a limited number of stocks that consistently beat the market. Famous TV presenter John Stossel did his [own version of the experiment](https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/931698146001#sp=show-clips) taking the monkey's place and reported higher returns as well.\n\nMonkeys were not the only animals that proved to be genius traders.\n\n* In 2012, a cat named Orlando made headlines for beating a team of investors narrowly over the span of a year. It made its “trading decisions” by dropping a toy mouse on a grid of numbers allocated to different companies. The result? The cat turned £5,000 into £5,542 while the investment professionals made £5,176!\n* Another absurd case was that of Michael Marcovici, an Austrian concept artist breeding and training “[rat traders](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/10/the-artist-who-trained-rats-to-trade-in-foreign-exchange-markets/381456/)” with names like Morgan Kleinsworth and Mr. Lehmann whom he claimed had a 57% accuracy rate!\n\nCrazy, right? But there's an unspoken truth here: ***The vast majority of animal prophets who pick stocks would not make the news, because they fail.*** Even a broken clock is correct twice a day, so is there more to this than just entertaining anecdotes? Can the “monkey index fund” stand the test of an experiment?\n\nThat's exactly what Robert Arnott and his team at Research Affiliates LLC set out to find.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4rl5gmuydxq81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97a4c239ffa4d113a75c0696d2e67416887841e1\n\n**The great monkey experiment**\n\nThe idea was simple: Instead of actually managing a monkey, [the team simulated a monkey’s picks by randomly selecting 30 stocks](https://thereformedbroker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/jpm_summer2013_rallc.pdf) from the top 1000 stocks by market capitalization and making an equally weighted index from it. The same process was repeated 100 times and the average returns were compared from 1964 to 2012.\n\nBurton Malkiel had said that a monkey would do as well as mutual funds. He was wrong. **The monkey actually beat the market 96 times out of 100!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19u12gt0exq81.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1426af78320a8b8f03a02c15590a460b8a1fc081\n\nThe graph above shows the distribution of the returns. In 75% of the cases, the monkey beat the market cap benchmark by more than 1%, and 30% of the time, it got a relative profit of greater than 2%! The returns of the monkey index fund were not only higher, but they were also better in terms of risk-adjusted return based on the Sharpe ratio. In terms of standard deviation though, the risk was slightly higher.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47p9xll1exq81.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93df7b6de4aa615fbb154806652eaf741d9a9a48\n\n**Round 2**\n\nThis was not the only experiment. [Researchers from Cass university leveraged Rob Arnott's experiment](https://www.ft.com/content/abd15744-9793-11e2-b7ef-00144feabdc0) to design their own: They picked stocks from a pool of 1000 without the restriction of equal weighting and compared the returns against the market - They did this for 10 million different portfolios for each year between 1968 and 2011. The results were mindblowing:\n\n* An investment of $100 in the US market in 1968 would have made just under $5000 by the end of 2011.\n* Half the monkeys generated more than $8,700.\n* A quarter returned more than $9,100.\n* 10 percent made more than $9,500 - A 940% profit or more!\n\nBut the study went further. The 3-year rolling average of the monkeys’ performance was taken and compared against the market cap fund year by year from 1972-2012 to check: **What proportion of monkeys beat the market every year?** These were the results:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogend9v2exq81.png?width=1272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421b1f790c0f6e993a31360506b7d76d5246a350\n\nThese numbers show how all-or-nothing the whole venture is. All the monkeys beat the market about 57% of the time, but they all underperformed the market about 31% of the time. The timing is also revealing: The monkeys win during bull runs but **underperform for long stretches during bear markets.** This is where the psychological element comes into play. It’s all fun and games when the going is good, but would you have the confidence to perform worse than the market for 5 to 6 years in a row *betting on a monkey’s predictions*?\n\nHaving said that, it’s still no joke that the monkeys beat the market cap funds **about 60% of the time.** The figures from earlier reveal that the average performance over the entire period is also better than market cap funds.\n\nSo how did they do it? **Were the monkeys stock-picking geniuses?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu5le7uydxq81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42ea422e73ab3a84785e4d7ac1f31ac4752add6c\n\n**Indexing is the key**\n\nBefore you run to the pet store looking for a dart-throwing monkey, let's try to figure out why this works in the first place. The reason for the monkeys’ success is hidden in where they came up short. If you look again at the data collected by the Rob Arnott team, you can see two things:\n\n1. Volatility (beta) is more in the case of the monkey index fund\n2. **Equally weighted market index funds** beat even the monkey index funds\n\nHow market index funds are created might play *an even bigger role than the individual stocks that are picked for the fund.* In market cap based index funds like the S&amp;P500, the weightage given to the companies isn't equal - It's based on their market capitalization. In times of turmoil, these funds are supposed to give more stability to the portfolio because they don't fluctuate as much. But that also means that your scope for growth is limited because there's only so much that big companies can grow.\n\nIn an **equally-weighted index fund**, on the other hand, the returns from the growth of small and value stocks are captured as well, but the price you pay is (supposedly) higher volatility. In the case of the monkeys picking random stocks, this is what happened - **Equal exposure to a few small stocks that saw massive growth balanced out the losses from other stocks.** It seemed like a gamble though, because of the risk involved.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0olfkm4exq81.png?width=925&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81207cbe5e59bbdd22b68979031a533a699ca2cc\n\nFrom 2000 onwards, equally-weighted index funds have outperformed SPY by **more than 100%**. The catch is that though Sharpe ratio looks similar, the volatility was more in the case of equally-weighted funds as shown by the standard deviation, with higher drawdowns as well during times of crashes. The higher returns provided by these stocks were a trade-off for the exposure to this volatility.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9fyhxsuydxq81.png?width=1728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85e12007691045be38e143661cb1239cf55b7a0f\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n&gt;*If one puts an infinite number of monkeys in front of (strongly built) typewriters and lets them clap away (without destroying the machinery), there is a certainty that one of them will come out with an exact version of the 'Iliad.' Once that hero among monkeys is found, would any reader invest their life's savings on a bet that the monkey would write the 'Odyssey' next?*  \n\\- Nicholas Nassim Taleb\n\nThe problem with fascinating strategies is that they might not be repeatable.\n\nThe extraordinary performance of randomly picked stocks does not mean that any pick you make will work. It just means that where there are outsized rewards, there are outsized risks as well. Most unknown stocks that make the headlines for exponential growth fall into the category of either **small stocks** or **value stocks**, and if you invest in them, you are rewarded for the risk you are taking on.

That reminded me of the days we used to have back in January where we would see SPY make wild 1%+ moves in an hour. Last time we had volume of 121mil/ day and movement like this was the start of the bear market back in January. Could April showers bring sorrows and bear arrows? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpal863gctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae1558cc49d0e8655d53d5f897a50cf7307e92f3\n\nDespite the essentially flat pre-market we saw quickly entering the intraday this morning we saw spy establish a bear trend with candles below the 8ema. And that is pretty much where we stayed all day. We saw a nice dip to 456.6 at open that led to a recovery to 458.76 around 11am. That morning recovery should have been everyone signal to buy puts for the end of the day as all the signs of a dip fill to 455.91 and potentially even a dip near 454 were clear and present around mid day. However, due to the wild reversals we have had the last two weeks we had to play it safely and unfortunately missed out on some incredible gains. \n\nHowever, end of the day brought the fire works. Start of power hour we saw the shake out fake rip to 457.36 before we saw spy jump off a cliff with one of the wildest power hours ive seen that took us to a low of 451.16 before finally closing at 451.63. That is an incredible 1.37% dip in one hour. Considering our intraday range was $2.7 till about 245pm the fact that SPY covered over $3 in an hour is quite impressive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzz5hzygctq81.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88eae5847685c5a055a4c5717c596f8bf3fc86d1\n\nNow that we have potentially “peaked” we will look at the downside levels that have not been in play for almost 3 weeks. \n\nThe next levels down support wise (major supports) are 450 \uf0e0 446 \uf0e0 443 \uf0e0 436\n\nThe next major resistance will be 459.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently we are also see two channels… the dotted channel that I refer to as the levels which support is intraday tomorrow would be 450 and resistance would be 458.5.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7hb4p3ictq81.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1dad19dca701e7b16c851b91635d1ab90d34a0e\n\nThe solid line downward channel puts resistance at 455 and support down near 447. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/seizqg1jctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69717795b1650eb859a89204d9457801c930a7f0\n\nThe daily candle close today is quite telling if you ask me. It closed BELOW the daily 8ema for the first time Since March 15th which you guessed it was the first green day of this massive two week long bull run we just went on. While the candle body is only below the 8ema if bears can gap this down tomorrow we just may see a full close below the 8ema which is very bearish. \n\nAlso of note is the fact that this is the first candle closed below fully below the mid point of the grey channel we have been trading within. That tells me the bulls finally lost momentum today. Support of the channel tomorrow would be at 452.5 any movement below that and we have officially broken the bull channel. That means bulls have to gap this up tomorrow and keep her green all day. \n\nThis is also the first back to back red days since the March 14th bottom. \n\nTodays volume at 122mil was the highest volume since you guessed it March 14th. Which that candle volume was 144mil and started the incredible bullrun we just went on. \n\nWith a new month starting tomorrow and monthly expire that took place today, along with the massive end of day sell off there is a very real possibility that the bear market dead cat bounce is being confirmed and we will now start pushing back to 420 range. \n\nAs much as I would like to tell everyone go buy 30dte puts and youll be rich… I don’t trust anyone at all. I don’t trust the MM not to run this back to ATH next week. The worst part about this bullrun we just had the last 2 weeks is that I will not be fully convinced of a bear market dead cat bounce until its too late to even capitalize on it properly. \n\nHowever, once the bears (if they truly are back in control) can get SPY back under the daily 200 ema at 439.33 I will then be convinced we are going to retest the 410-420 lows. However, at that point I would be waiting for a 410 retest. If 410 was to hold and see a convincing double bottom I would be looking for some 2-3year LEAPS to purchase. If 410 was to break I would still fully expect a dip near 380. \n\nThe VIX intraday saw a spike to 21.5 after being pretty flat all day between 19.5 and 20.5. With the vix closed above 20.5 And spy well below where it was the last time VIX was at 20.5 if the vix continues to trend back up we just might see some more downside. As always all eyes on the VIX. It did not lead us astray today or at all this week.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bl5ee9kctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72e4409b6f0832658d580b1f8048c90bfeedfe01\n\nAs you guys know I strongly believe Apple is a gateway into what SPY will do and their correlation is very strong. Looking at the daily chart of Apple we see a similar set up. It closed a candle below the mid support of the channel for the first time in 2 week and saw now back to back red days for the first time in two weeks. Apple however was able to keep its close above the daily 8ema at 173.55. I fully anticipate apple to start heading back down and break its daily 8ema tomorrow too. With the RSI now in a downtrend I will be keeping all my eyes on Apple tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% daily challenge-\n\nToday was another great day of trading in the server. I probably had one of the best weeks I have had since January so far. \n\nI made 4 total trades today. \n\nA 0dte put at open for 10% gain. \n\nA 0dte put that I had to hold all the way to -50% before I was finally able to average down and secure a 20% gain on. \n\nA 4dte put during power hour that I tapped for 25% which of course ran to well over 100% at close. But after greed killed my gains on Monday and obviously no one knowing we were going to dump that far (I fully expected 454 but not 451…) I had to secure profits and then I was out of buying power by that time. \n\nI also played a 8dte Apple put that I was going to hold over night (had bought around 230pm before it broke its support) but ended up selling before close for 45% gain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall another great trading day. \n\nGoing into tomorrow im currently sitting just under 3x my weekly profit goal and I am going to be very patient and not erase all my gains this week. Being a Friday I have no idea what to expect but the last few Fridays have been quite great trading days for me. I do know the last week every morning trading session has been nothing but chop and tight $2-$3 ranges before we finally make a massive end of day move. I will be patient and I will make my moves count.

While we just had a massive 2 weeks of bull run it is too soon still to tell if we are in a new bear channel but currently there is quite the case to make that we are starting our new leg down. It just is not as aggressive as we saw back in January. \n\nToday we broke below one of the major support “levels” of 450.5 We traded underneath it for quite a while too before we finally saw a true end of day reversal and finished between two levels. We are currently between the 450 and 456 levels but we are also trading within a downward channel that was established when we peaked on March 29th. \n\nThis downward channel gives us a support of 447 and 454. Intraday there was a very heavy indication that we were going to see a bigger dip today and possibly see 445, however, around 115pm the bears managed to turn arguably one of the clearest bear channels ive ever seen with not a single candle or even candle body closed about the 15min 8ema from 845am until 130pm. That is a very strong trend that I am still beyond impressed that the bulls were able to true reverse which used to be rare, but is becoming uncomfortably more common. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n19rl078o0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31df256ba1c279467564fc5b831bf22d42f3b51b\n\nWill need to see how ES opens Sunday night and how pre-market looks Monday morning but that afternoon run up seems to have heated up the RSI and we now have a MACD sell signal. The last candle of the day was also very impressive by the fact that we once again had massive sell pressure and downward momentum along with the VIX trending back up steadily only for it to slam the breaks on and do a 180 about face and elevator up. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myjm8539o0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6e542f3729ac5d3488f1c9da09024b2c9e676ac\n\nLooking at the VIX it seemed any time we neared 21 we would about face. It is the same with VIX at 19 it doesn’t seem to want to break below it. \n\nThe VIX is now trending for the last 4 days between 18.9 and 20.6 as its key “support” and key “resistance” areas. Mind you VIX doesn’t really have those but its just the levels the VIX seems to bounce between. Historically over the last year 16 to 21.6 has been the happy range that VIX bounces between. As I had mentioned earlier in the week the VIX is what we need to be trading currently as the VIX has been the only hints to these end of day sell offs. It will be very interesting to see next week where we head. \n\nLooking at Apple it actually showed arguably more weakness initially then SPY did. Apple pre-market levels were much lower then SPY. However, Apple was able to find support near 172 intraday and seemed to like trading around the 172.8 to 173.5 level most of the day before the end of day pop. \n\nAs you can see by the chart next to VIX, Apple too is in a massive downward trend where it is seeing lower highs and lower lows each day now since March 30th. \n\nI wanna touch on Apples daily chart first and then we will get into SPY daily and weekly chart and start seeing some key levels headed into next week!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/httmjjzao0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7376495d302a315872a057f1c6bfef180db14ccb\n\nApple has by all means topped out and peaked. The most recent high of 179.61 on March 30th which also happened to be its first red day in 12 days by all means looks like it could see the next leg down. \n\nApple today broke its bullish channel that was established two weeks ago on the start of its run up. To me that is something to watch going into next week for sure. Apple also flirted with its daily 8ema of 173.72 for a long part of the day and for most of the day it was resistance before the end of day fat green candle gapped it up over the 8ema to close what really was a bearish day to appear bullish. \n\nThe red channel is now void (left it on there for visualization) and the grey is what ia m watching as in play now. The support line of it is VERY strong with three points but the upper is still being tested. I will be watching Apple if the bull momentum is still there to pop to a peak of 179.2 next week. However, what I really will be anticipating based off the RSI and the MACD on the daily I fully expect a retrace to test at minimum support of the daily 20 ema at 169.58. We very well could see a dip as low as the daily 100ema at 164.71 before it finds some real support. This bullrun of Apple was impressive but very unnatural pattern wise. \n\nToday also is the first time since March 17th that a candle has broken below the 8ma. Intraday and later this week I had seen quite a bit of weakness from Apple.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xb80vjgco0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d759271b509ef2466f8a1576c2a5a3eaac644388\n\nNow taking a look at SPY. Today we too saw a very similar (not surprised) move of Apple breaking its current two week bull run channel to the downside. The grey channel is now null and we will look to see if SPY can find some downside next week or not. Today was the first time since March 16th that  SPY was able to get a candle wic below the daily 8ema support line.\n\nThursday and today were the first time in two weeks that SPY actually looked “weak.” I still do not know how they managed to get this green end of day today but I did not have the strength it once had. \n\nThe RSI is at 57 on the daily and the MACD is well above the zero line and ready to cross over to sell for the first time since March 15th. But this would be the first cross over to sell above the signal line since January 5th which we all know what happened after that…\n\nThe daily 8ema of SPY actually acted as support and resistance all day with a majority of it acting as resistance. I was fairly confident we would at minimum see a candle body below the 8ema but the MM had other plans. However, there is a very good chance that we see further downside. In general when spy breaks a wick over a major support/ resistance such as the 8ema, 20ema, 100ema, or 200 ema the next candle or shortly after will be below it. The daily chart finally looks bearish to me. \n\nIntraday had we been able to keep the bearish momentum up I fully believe we would have seen 444-446 range which is the Daily 100 (446.42), daily 20 (445.62), Daily 50 (444.42) and then lastly the daily 200 ema is all the way down at 439.46). \n\nTarget wise for next week IF the bull momentum continues we will look to establish the next resistance point of the orange channel which would be around a max of 460 for Monday. I also have a resistance line from the March 29th/ 30th tops which I will be watching at the 458 level if Monday ends up being bullish. \n\nIf the bears are able to get the momentum going (and sustain it… they have had the momentum realistically a few times these last two weeks but the bulls have refused to let them capitalize on it) I will look for that 444-446 range Monday. We have not see a -2% day in almost a month with the reddest day being a very moderate -1.3% back on March 11th. While I would never play it position wise we are “due” in my opinion for a fairly bearish day.  Though with the vix now trending down in the 20s we may not get these massively green or red days we grew so accustom to. In the last two weeks the average close +/-  has been 0.75 to 1.25%. The only real massive volatility I have seen in the last two weeks was on Thursday during power hour where we dipped 1.4% total. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yv0wre7eo0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dbfb6cbbe8bebb15114dcee0d955f5844d434f8\n\nTaking a look at the weekly chart for SPY now shows a bit of a different story compared to the daily. We are actually still within the bullish grey channel established back the week of March 7th. This channel gives the weekly range of a high of 480 (yes that’s ATH) and a low of 450… if we are obeying the channel. 450 is interesting to me because that acutually is right around the lows of today intraday with us reaching almost 449 for a short period of time. \n\nWeekly volume wise we did see an increase from last week with volume coming in total around 445.5 mil. This is still slightly below the previous 2 months average but about 70mil higher than last week.\n\nThe weekly actually shows a much better downward channel in my opinion then the daily does. The orange channel would give us a high of 460 for the week and a mid channel point of 431 with the current bottom of the channel being down near 404 which is also the weekly 100 EMA. \n\nThe one thing I am watching VERY closely on this weekly chart is how the candle finished. IT finished in a gravestone doji candle. Which is actually a very bearish indicator. Now while its not perfect and could be nothing I look back at the weekly and almost everytime we have seen a doji candle formed on the weekly (week of Feb 28th, Jan 10th, Nov 15th) we have seen downside the next week. The gravestone doji make it even more of a bearish omen. However, the one bullish thing I am seeing on the weekly is the MACD. That macd is sitting on the zero line and looks poised to cross over to a buy. Of course a MACD that’s near crossing can false cross, or can kiss but never truly cross so it should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nOverall I really believe in a bearish week coming up. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tiypiufo0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd2af2a57a48ac76ca61278c226f9a7d60c77af1\n\nWith the 10year and 2 year (-0.06) officially closed inverted and the 3yr and 5yr inverting last week We are seeing the signs of an impending recession. While the market seems to have over the last two weeks shrugged off anything and everything inflation or economy related I think its only a matter of time before they finally start to realize how bad things are and start their panic. \n\nNext week economic and fed wise we have the FOMC minutes on Wednesday at 2pm, jobless claims on Thursday along with consumer credit. \n\nWhile not a big news or data week we have the looming CPI coming out on April 12 which is less than two weeks away and I suspect it to become a talking point again soon. With gas prices and inflation they way they are I suspect the number is going to be much worse than expected and we will see a the markets begin to react and price things in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started the week off on a big L due to greed and a trend reversal. I was lucky enough to have a great 3 days of trading which put me well above my weekly profit goal so I went very heavy wisk on today. I failed to secure some profits that I definitely should have as I truly believed in the bear trend today and was fully expecting the next big move down. However, it just never came. After taking profits well before the massive sell off Thursday with no buying power left I decided despite being up nearly 50% at one point on positions to hold and not take profits as I believe like SPY used to that we would see a small retrace before breaking the intraday low. I did not think the bulls would actually end today green like they did. \n\nWith that being said lets take a look at me weekly progress and monthly being that the month is now over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly profit goal- $2500\n\nActual profit- $3200\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAverage % gains per trade= 3%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly win rate- 68%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonthly profit goal- $10,000\n\nActual profit- $6,700 (just shy of my goal… which looking back is very good considering I spent the first 2 weeks of the month establishing a new part of my strategy and learning a new indicator) \n\nLooking back it does hurt knowing had I not gotten greedy Monday and had I not gone full risk on today I would have succeeded my monthly goal. But sometimes we do have to risk some to see bigger profits. In moderation and not blowing up an account it can be worth while. But in the end profits will always be king\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonthly win rate- 63%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall it really was a great month that had some great lessons.'), ('TSLA $1170C 4/14.

This has been the most hectic first quarter for the market in a long time.  I don't have any major events to speculate on this week, I am now looking at the bond markets. \n\nI remember talking about the bond markets 2 months ago saying an inverted yield curve could come in the next 5 months.  The bond markets are moving very fast however, this is not a good sign and the yield curve actually inverted last week with a 7.5bp negative spread in 10Y and 2Y government bonds.  \n\nIn 2001 when the yield curve inverted this was just about at the top of the market, when the yield curve inverted in 2008 there was still another 8 months before the market crashed.  This shows us that after the yield curve inverts it is only the final speculators that will prop up the market.  In 2001 it was obvious to many big funds that these trash companies were going for an IPO and then running 1000%, they knew that there was a bubble so when the yield curve inverted it was only a short period of time that this speculation crashed.  In 2008 though, the bubble was less obvious to many retail investors and funds, everyone was sure that the housing market was very solid and would forever be.  This caused many people to continue buying even through the obvious signs of a recession (the yield curve inverting).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2esx9y1cj5r81.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=174fde35e21b44ac9431af1b9ac3d3b02cf85793\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hjnlfjdj5r81.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca999f349064faf40057b32eac2d49f1123dfa2f\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not dumb like we all think they are, they are just saying as much positive news as they possible can to try to keep a positive sentiment in the markets.

They have been selling in fact, and the ad in the SuperBowl was their introduction into the NA markets. \n\nNow Polestar itself is already selling cars and growing, with last years sales being 29,000 vehicles and representing a growth of 185% from the year prior.

Rivian and Lucid specifically are trading based off of expected revenue rather than current, which makes Polestar all the more attractive as offers a more solidified sales aspect with expected growth and production and a cheaper entry point.\n\n\nNow I am just a shill, but I actually like what I see.

I’ll try to do my part to bring back a bit of that magic. \n\nFB EoY 2023 Price Target: $310 (+29%) based on P/E of 21\n\n\nIn February ’22, Facebook reported that its active users had declined for the first time the history of the company – likely due to the growth of rival platform Tiktok - and that Apple’s IDFA changes could cost the company about $10 billion in advertising revenue a year. Shares immediately dropped 27%, or $232 billion in market cap. As of this writing, Facebook trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 5.3, and a price-to-earnings of 17.\nFacebook’s valuation has tanked so badly that it’s priced in nearly every pessimistic outcome. On the day Google announced their intention to make changes similar to IDFA, Facebook’s shares actually rose 1%, implying further IDFA restrictions were already baked into the reduced price. Facebook reported revenue of $125 Billion in 2021, a staggering 37% YoY growth from 2020 – which was already a bloated revenue year thanks to the COVID lockdowns.\n\n\nFor many years, Facebook has been the target of federal regulation, from the Cambridge Analytica Scandal to the WSJ Facebook Archives where a whistleblowing Product Manager painted an image of a company that extracted a portion of its engagement from predating on the insecurities of preteens girls. Meanwhile, a different social media company who extracts the entirety of its engagement from insecure teenagers is on the rise, with Bytedance’s 2021 revenue growing 70% to $51 billion a year, generating a staggering private valuation of $350 billion – making it the most highly valued tech unicorn in the world.\nTypically, public markets attract loftier multiples than private markets, as the companies have been vetted through the IPO process and mega funds like Blackstone and Fidelity are less price sensitive than their private equity peers. However, in Facebook and Bytedance we have an interesting spread that’s steadily growing: a Price-to-Sales ratio of 5.2 for Facebook, and 7.0 for Bytedance. This can be explained one of three ways: one: Tiktok enjoys a healthier price-to-earnings ratio (undisclosed, since Bytedance is private) than Facebook. Two: the market is pricing in greater near-term risks associated with Facebook than Bytedance. Three: the market is pricing in stronger future growth for Bytedance than Facebook.\n\n\nThe first explanation is possible, but unlikely. Facebook enjoys an operating margin of 33.4%, an incredible ratio for a company that’s also growing revenues at 38% a year, while already attracting and retaining world-class engineering and product talent. This produces its industry-low price-to-earnings of 17, which is by far the lowest among all $500B+ market cap tech companies (compare to GOOG at 25, AMZN at 52, MSFT at 35, and AAPL at 30). Growth stage social media companies typically run very thin operating margins (Pinterest at 48 P/E) or even in the red (Snapchat at -120 P/E). Bytedance is known to be spending heavily to expand its U.S. offices, but running into severe hiring issues as its current average employee tenure is 7 months (compared to Meta at 18 months).\n\n\nThe second and third explanations are the most likely culprits, but have significant risks of being incorrect. In 2020, Trump threatened to ban Tiktok from the U.S, and Bytedance explored serious talks for a sale of the U.S. assets of the Tiktok product to Microsoft. A federal judge filed an injunction blocking Trump’s ban, but national surveys showed roughly 38% of Americans supported the ban. This is a historical high for any poll involving a Trump decision, which generally experience lowered poll numbers simply because they’re proposed by Trump. In Feb 2022, Facebook rolled out Reels to all users across its products, which cloned nearly every feature from the standalone app.\nA few months after Facebook added Stories to Instagram – a copy of the key feature from Snapchat – data showed Instagram stories usage exceeded Snapchat’s and was on track to continue growing 200% a year. Snapchat’s stock tanked 40% overnight, as its marquee feature was reproduced and socialized by the larger giant with little effort. Tiktok’s moat is slight wider than Snapchat – its key strength is in its treasure trove of video data, which have been used to train powerful recommendation algorithms that keep its users scrolling endlessly – early data indicates adoption of reels is quickly ramping up on Facebook. Plotting a Recommendation algorithms’ effectiveness against the amount of data it has produces a logarithmic curve – efficiency scales quickly at first with more data, then the gains become increasingly minor. With Facebook’s network of 3 billion active users, it won’t take longer a few months to reach a critical mass of training data to build strong like-audience recommendations. It may take some effort to build short-form video recommendation muscle on the Reels team – but with Tiktok hemorrhaging talent, recruiting the right data scientists should be simple.\n\n\nThe elephant in the room is Zuckerberg’s bold pronouncement that the company’s future is in the Metaverse. This particular strategic focus is likely compressing the company’s valuation by 15-20%, as investors are still skeptical of VR as the next great platform following smartphones. Facebook’s key initiatives in this area – Oculus and Horizon – have been significant loss leaders, and are expected to continue to pressure the company’s bottom line going forward. Horizon’s MAU is estimated to be lower than 300,000, and Oculus has lost the company an estimated $10 billion to date. Zuckerberg’s primary articulation of this strategy is that it gives Facebook their own platform, instead of living and dying by the whims of Apple and Google. However, early glimmers of hope are beginning to show in the data: recent sales and engagement trends for VR have been rising YoY since 2019, and Facebook is the market leader with 40% of market share.\nEven if Zuckerberg’s bet does not pan out, the problem of Platform Independence may sort itself out in the near future as the two smartphone giants face increased scrutiny from the newly minted head of the FTC: Lina Khan, a self-proclaimed opponent of big tech who considers the past ten years of anti-trust litigation as wasted time. Her first published piece in 2012 outlined the depressive effects of Amazon’s publishing arm on the diversity of ideas in books, providing an early hint into her predilection for singling out the monopolistic or duopolistic owners of platforms.\n\n\nIn summary, a bet on Facebook is a bet on one of three outcomes, any one of which would imply at least 40%+ upside to the stock’s current price:\n\n\n- Facebook Reels overtakes as the premier short-form video platform, either through network effects of Facebook products or federal regulation against Tik Tok\n\n- Facebook achieves a greater deal of platform independence from Google and Apple, either through its continued success in building its own platform or federal regulation against Google and Apple\n\n- Facebook maintains a rapid clip of revenue growth, ending another year with 30%+ growth despite short term headwinds in Tik Tok and Google IDFA, alleviating investors concerns about its ability to grow in current conditions.\n\n\nPosition: Buy'), ('$60k amd monthly call.

It'd be limited to the evening and a very selective audience while competing against free platforms who offer exposure to ads all day long which means LOTS of revenue.\n\nBottom line is this:\n\nZuck is a fraud.

I think that UPS stock looks like it's going to have a technical breakout soon and here is my thesis. First off, a look at the day chart:\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/U9miIAD7\n\nUPS and the rest of the transport sector (logistics, railroad, shipping) have been falling fast and hard recently. I mean take a look at the Dow transport index, it has tanked which pretty much predicted the drop in broader markets we are seeing in recent days (look up Dow transport theory). But I think that things are going to rebound, at least temporarily here. On the daily chart, the rsi for UPS is approaching oversold territory. At the same time, it has bounced off a support which has stood for close to six months. This support also serves as the 50% retracement for the rally up to its all time highs which occured in early 2022. These combined indicate a pretty good chance of at least a short term bounce, which can be profitable if played right \n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/fjqZ8tKN\n\nOn the 2hr time frame it can be seen that rsi is below 25 which indicates the stock is severely oversold. The stock is breaking steep downward resistance on this time frame and the macd is also cycling to bullish territory.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/G1HcfBxs\n\nAs far as the general market goes, spy successfully defended the 38.2 retracement of it's most recent rally. Though it appears to have the looks of a head and shoulders pattern on a macro scale, I believe the defending of this support indicates a bounce may be coming soon. The reason for the drop over the last couple days was the pricing in of a larger second rate hiking coming. Though a rate hike seems plausible soon, I don't think it'll be nearly as high as the 100 basis points which has been circulating media.\n\nOverall I think that the general market will bounce in the coming days and with it, I believe that UPS will bounce very strongly.\n\nGood luck to all who play this!\n\nPositions: UPS 5/20 210c"), ('AMZN Yolo', 'AMZN Yolo'), ('Walking Away [USD] [AAPL]', "Walking Away [USD] [AAPL]There’s as much political capital to use the *R* word as there is for austerity.

This isn't going to last long before things stop wobbling and start breaking:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3i6izl30vr81.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c6bae5e2e49d52e8c703381e6bf30765c7ac7ec\n\nSo what does this mean for markets? It means a wipe-out. It means the type of capitulation that proffers generational buying opportunities. I see it as more than this, in fact; I see it as a redistribution of wealth, blood on the streets style. My nephew who uses FBA to sell products on Amazon with margins of about $1, has already had to raise the product price 20% to make the same amount of money but his sales volume has plummeted. If he continued selling at the previous price, he'd be losing money with each item. That's an anecdotal and seemingly irrelevant example, but my point is that the weakest will get squeezed first and our economy IS NOT designed for oil over $95. The entire thing has adapted around certain energy input costs like our evolutionary biology has oxygen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0ekwoj40vr81.jpg?width=1160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=661bcbb29604eaedd66ffe9e0d7380346618b31e\n\nLook at the trucker tender reject index above... This is up exponentially from last year. This reading is actually worse than every recession on record.\n\nThis all sets the stage for the coming food crisis late summer into fall which I talked about in the Doom Vortex post. It'll destabilize the Middle East, and send a deadly wave of immigration into Turkey and Western Europe. Fertilizer price index:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/isrm8bj50vr81.jpg?width=920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3aba31e0e672ba0d25214d69fd007eeb631dc73\n\nWe'll look back and see that the bear market started in in November 2021, and was confirmed in April (or May) of 2022 with the 20% down breach. Then we'll look back and see the recession started early in 2022.\n\nMy prediction is that the Turkish Lira continues its hyper-inflationary moves, and goes bust in the next 12 months. That's dangerous because of the inbound immigration issues nobody is seeing play out. They'll be left with the choices of either moving closer towards China (an emerging debtor nation who can proffer money and commodities), or to sacrifice their children at the IMF altar, hoping its SDR (special drawing rights) has enough inputs to float them past outrageous fortune. Either way, they'll be giving away huge concessions. Or they can choose the digital gold pathway, which will cause all types of trouble early, and then later because digital gold over a long enough time period completely demonetizes the political class; but it makes sovereign citizens and the scarcity in the money leads to an abundance of everything else, meaning it would be great for the people at large. Turkey is a strategically located country in geographical terms, and has an enormous manufacturing base. The former is why it's so valuable to China, so EU would be willing to overspend to keep them in the fold, putting evermore pressure on the Euro. Money machine go *brrrrr*.\n\nLastly here's a thought experiment with an anecdotal example:\n\nAssume that Starbucks made an NFT large latté. This NFT latté was exchangeable for a real latté at any Starbucks location. That latté is $5. But now assume that this NFT latté could be held on any non-custodial wallet in the world, which you could spend it from, and Apple integrated spending of such tokenized securities from ApplePay. Ok, but now assume there are DeFi marketplaces for these, meaning I can swap that latte for a Big Mac, some doughnuts, or sell it for digital gold, HODL it, or gift it, take a loan on it, etcetera. Assume any trade of such tokenized securities cost less than a penny, settled instantly, and moved at the speed of light. Why would anybody hold USD (and thusly stablecoins) when they could hold these globally? Why not hold the NFTs instead ? Because they'll keep pace with inflation. Assume the network these all travel on can eliminate the 4% charged by Amex, Visa etcetera. That chargebacks dropped 50%. Refunds were instant. Settlement was instant. Global restrictions were gone. Liquidity could be acquired instantly, and it offered a revolutionary way to advertise like Facebook did a decade ago. That's the Lightning Network's future, and it's not good for banks, remittance, card processors, stablecoins, or paper money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[T\\]he above is the Weimar papiermark versus gold chart.

Well not a whole lot new honestly. All we have learned is that clearly JPOW are hawkish and ready to do another 0.5bps hike in May at the next meeting. We also learned that the previously doveish members are now even hawkish. \n\nSPY had a massive gap down at open today from 451 close all the way to 447.3 at open, which of course left a big gap on the daily chart. We know how SPY does not like to leave gaps too… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fpfvqc4k10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83bc89d145cfecdce94507165673aece3ae9233c\n\nIntraday despite the massively red pre-market and first big red candle SPY traded within a pretty tight range hovering around 445.5 from 945am to 130pm. We saw some green start to take off right before the minutes dropped. They got a lot of people with the fake out (me included) with running it all the way to 448.5 before they dropped it like its hot to 444.2 immediately after. From there I saw some of the craziest intraday swings in such a short period of time that I have ever seen. \n\nSpy dropped from 448.5 to a low of 443.47 (-1.1%, $5) rose to a high of 448.93 (+1.23%, $5.5) and then dipped to 445.32 (-0.8%, $3.5) and rose to 448 (+0.6%, $2.7) all within two hours of trading. That kind of volatility has not been seen in quite a long time. And being end of the day those who were brave enough to play 0dte made some incredible gains. I was able to recoup my losses plus 2x daily profit on one 0dte put on the initial -1.1% drop along with a few call plays to hit 6x daily profit in one day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/20qyh0vk10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c09e88166331fcec08f5b2056873f3ebf36339c\n\nIt is not surprising that we traded so close to 445.5 all day as that level is a key support of the Daily 20ema. It looked like when the minutes released we may see an aggressively red day and close below those key supports near the 440 level, however, 445 proved to be too strong to break through today. We also found out that 448 to 449 was major resistance too, as anytime we touched it end of day we immediately rejected down.\n\nWith a clear MACD sell and RSI trending downward now, favor to bears short term.\n\nOn the daily chart you can see we technically still have about an 89 cent gap from 448.93 to 449.82. Some could argue a gap this small is not important and will not be filled yet. One also may argue since its to the upside the push to close it now is not there as much as a gap below would be. Todays close and post market still have some bearish flavor to it. However, being able to close about the EMAs is fairly bullish. \n\nIntraday tomorrow and overnight we need to see if 1. The gap will be filled up to 449.82 and 2. If the daily 20ema (447.05), daily 100ema (446.7) and daily 50ema (445.2) is going to hold as support intraday tomorrow with the daily 50ema being the key support. If we were to get a bullish push tomorrow the daily 8ema at 451.37 will now come in to play as possible resistance. Failure for bulls to break and close above that again would be bearish. \n\nIf the bears were to get another true bear day I would suspect they will try to close near the 200ema at 439.82. That being the final support bulls have to hold before we would see 410-420 again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l3h71cpl10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c48bf03234f779648e9cdd5b12a2b0a89ce94e9b\n\nThe weekly candle is now coming in fairly bearish after a doji last week would hint to me that we very well could see some red next week also. Key support for bulls to hold would be the weekly 8ema at 444.88 and the weekly 20ema at 446.43. A close back below those would all be confirm a dip next week back near the weekly 50ema of 435.07. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe VIX had yet another massive day today from its low of 21.24 to its highest point of 24.78 ranging 16.6% of movement. This is three massive movement days for VIX in a row, yet we have not really seen a massive 2%+/- day for SPY yet. I believe tomorrow or Friday it is coming. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/859rj1dm10s81.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e1e339da7ce05cd1b42af887d81a063f4c23fa\n\nThe VIX key level to watch is 24.5 for the bears and 22 for the bulls. Now that the VIX is back ABOVE the average of 16.5 to 21.5 the bulls are in favor here as its is usually easier for VIX to unwind down with no new news than to go up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs87cr4n10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f73551d16c61e551142a0c8accadd5bff0a408b\n\nApple is looking similar to SPY on the daily chart with a clear MACD sell, and rsi at 53 trending down. Apple also has a pretty significant gap from 174.42 to 173.63 (0.45%, 0.79) on the daily chart. \n\nApple found support today at its daily 20ema which has not ben touched in over two weeks. \n\nApple bulls need a green day tomorrow to fill the gap up to a 174.42, however, they will need to break now resistance at the daily 8ema. \n\nApple bears will look for a close below the daily 20ema at 170.96. Bears will not need a very red day to accomplish this and their ultimate goal will be to get Apple below the daily 50ema at 168.44(only -2% from todays close) by end of the week. If bears can accomplish this 157 to 165 will be back in play. A close below the daily 100ema of 165.31 (-3.8% from close) while a very tough chore to accomplish in two days, it is not out of possibility for Apple depending how markets react. \n\nThe questions going into tomorrow is now that the markets have the full minutes from FOMC and nothing news wise until April 12th with the next CPI data…. Which I fully expect to be awful and another emergency/ surprise rate hike. With the markets now seeing the true hawkish fed and the new info about the balance sheets/ QT and rate hikes is the markets going to go back into full panic mode like January? Or will the markets too quickly price this in and return to full rally mode? \n\nI will be looking at tomorrows close and more importantly Fridays close for that clue. We have key supports and resistance that will give us a clue going into next week. \n\nI will be back on the sever all day tomorrow after taking the morning off for personal errands and I will also have a proper pre market post up around 9am tomorrow on the server for everyone. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a pretty good day for me.\n\nAs I said I was gone all morning and ended up not trading till about 1230. I entered some Apple and Spy puts around that time that I held till the first big green candle at 2pm and sold both for -50%. I then was able to grab a nice 80% 0dte play on the way down to recoup those loses + x2 my daily gains goalI had another 2dte -20% put that I played on the first recovery bounce when it faked us out red before ripping green (which is when I entered calls). I then played two different 2dte calls one for 40% and one for 30%. Overall being able to hit 6x my daily profit goal is incredible. I look to go into Thursday and Friday with low risk and being very conservative as I do not want to risk losing all these gains on silly plays.

Here are the results!', 'I analyzed 2,000+ stock splits over the last 3 decades to see if you can make money from stock splits. Here are the results!Stock splits are all the rage - After Google announced in Feb that there would be a 20:1 stock split in July this year, Amazon has followed suit announcing a similar 20:1 split and sending the market into a frenzy. Amazon’s price was up by 6% the next day and Google’s stock rose more than 9% in after-market trading following the news. Tesla is also planning for a second stock split and most recently, GME has also announced its stock split.\n\nWe do know that stock splits do not affect the underlying business in any way, but it is undeniable that there is price movement around the announcement and execution of a stock split. So in this week’s analysis, let’s deep-dive into the world of stock splits, how and why they are executed, and most important… Is it possible to make money off of a stock split?\n\n**What is a stock split and how is it executed?**\n\nA stock split is a simple decision by the company board to increase (or in some cases decrease) the outstanding shares of the company. For example, let’s say you own 10 shares of company X worth $100 each. So in total, you own $1K worth of shares in the company. If the company announces a 2-for-1 stock split, now you will have 20 shares of the company worth $50 each. But the total value of shares you own in the company does not change. You will still own the same $1k (20 x 50) worth of shares that you started with.\n\nIf you are wondering why companies engage in stock splits, the following are some of the key reasons.\n\n* **Affordability:** Sometimes the stock becomes too expensive for retail investors to buy into. Consider Amazon - One stock is worth close to $3k now. So the minimum amount you would need to start investing in Amazon is $3k which might not be affordable to a vast majority of retail investors \\[1\\] Also there is the psychological impact of buying a share worth $3k and a share worth $30.\n* **Options:** For the options players, there is a huge difference when a stock is cheap. In options, a single contract is worth 100 shares. So for a covered call strategy incorporating Amazon, before stock split, you would need a single stock position worth more than $275K vs only \\~$14K exposure after the said 20:1 stock split.\n* **Liquidity:** Since more shares are outstanding for the company after the split, it will result in greater liquidity and a lesser bid-ask spread. It also allows the company to buy back their shares at a lower cost since their orders would not move up the share price as much, due to higher liquidity.\n\nNow before we jump into the analysis, you should understand how exactly a stock split is executed. On **announcement day**, investors get to know that a stock split is going to happen soon. The stockholders eligible for the stock split are decided on the record date. This is mainly a formality. The actual split would happen on the **ex-split date (or ex-date)**. After this, the stocks would start trading at their new price. For example, in a 20:1 split, the stocks would trade at 1/20th the previous price after the ex-date. From our data, we observed that there was an average delay of 36 days between the announcement day and ex-split date.\n\n**Data**\n\nFor this analysis, I have used the data from [Fidelity’s stock split calendar](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/conferenceCalls.jhtml?tab=splits) that tracks the announcements and execution of stock splits, from as far back as 1980! I have considered splits only from 1993 (due to stock price data availability), and I have considered only companies that currently have a market cap of $1Billion or above. I have also ignored reverse stock splits as the data is too small to be statistically significant.\n\nThis gives us a total of more than 2,000 stock splits to work with. In case you are interested in the raw data, I have shared both the raw data and analysis through links at the end \\[2\\].\xa0\n\n**Returns**\n\nAs soon as a stock split is announced, there is bound to be a lot of buying and selling activity. The question is, how much return could you have seen? There are a few scenarios possible here.\n\n**Short Term Returns**\n\nThe short term plays possible around stock splits are:\n\n1. You already own the stock and see its price go up on announcement day.\n2. You did not own the stock on the announcement day so you buy the stock just before the actual stock split execution.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7ujpf1y2is81.png?width=619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60912ef1adabca10f9f857da0321abf1363f705a\n\nAs expected, the announcement of a stock split sends the stock pumping with a 1.48% 2-day return when compared to only 0.09% return generated by SPY during the same time period. You would still have beaten the market if you had bought the stock one day before the actual split execution day and then held it for two days (albeit by much less - 1/7th of the gains you would have made if you had owned it before the announcement).\n\n**Long Term Returns**\n\nConsidering that a stock split is supposed to indicate growth prospects, what happens when you hold for a longer time? There are two possibilities:\n\n1. You buy the stock just after the announcement of the split\n2. You buy the stock on the split execution date.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51513s603is81.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62ed4a28a5e57254549e79a65ccd952219eea34a\n\nBuying just after the announcement would have paid off handsomely with the returns beating the market easily in the long run. On average you would have had an alpha of 1.5% over the market in just over a month.\n\nBut, on the other hand, if you buy it on the day of the split, the returns are not that great. You would have lost money in the first week on average and would have been underperforming SPY even over the period of one month. You would have had to wait about a year for your portfolio to overtake SPY. This is to be expected because by the time of the actual split, the hype has died down a bit and the rallies in price are a bit more uncertain.\n\n**What about H\\*DLers?**\n\nThis is another interesting case where you would have bought stocks on their announcement date or ex-split date and held on till today, starting from 1993 \\[3\\]. Though most people wouldn’t trade by this strategy, it’s interesting to see how it would have fared. \\[4\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6i7py113is81.png?width=810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c74d9f2afdcb64f342300dd6c6bb0169f208a58c\n\nIf you had bought all stocks that underwent a split and held till today, you would have beaten the S&amp;P 500 by close to 200%!\n\n**How certain are our returns?**\n\nNext, we have to look into whether the alpha we are seeing here is due to a few stocks that are skewing the results. Even though I have capped for outliers, I wanted to know what % of stocks undergoing a split beat the market over the different time periods that we just saw.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4506by13is81.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdd95395be1c8e00bb00ea578eea899d756fe635\n\nWell, would you look at that! Except in one case, the odds would be in your favor to beat the market if you had followed this strategy. As expected, for short term the highest chance is if you had owned the stock before the announcement (which is not realistic), but even if you had bought it one day after the announcement, you would have had almost a 60% chance of beating the market by the actual execution day.\n\n**The cheap and the expensive**\n\nThe usual rationale behind a stock split is that the stock has become too over-priced, and splitting it makes it cheaper for retail investors to buy into - But the data revealed some contrary insights. Over 90% of the stocks were less than $52 in value at the time of the split, and only 5% were over $230 in value!\n\nSo obviously, the question is - **Was there an advantage to buying cheaper stocks or more expensive stocks at the time of a split**, and how did they compare to the total set and the benchmark?\n\nThe 10 percentile value for the adjusted close at the time of announcement was $3.50 (203 stocks less than this value), and the 90 percentile value was around $43 (203 stocks more than this value). Here are the average returns for these sets.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hzenccz23is81.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4debdb20bdedbd1c9b06aa887de2acb8c5ee5569\n\nThe lower-priced stocks seem to have a massive advantage in almost all respects, sometimes giving a return of more than twice the complete set of splits in the long term! On the other hand, the higher-priced stocks have a poor record - Though they beat the benchmark in the short term\\[5\\], in the long term, their performance is much lower than the stocks having a lower price.\n\nOne of the reasons that the lower-priced stocks have such a high average is because stellar companies like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Nike, etc. were trading for less than 5 dollars per share in the 90s - But this doesn’t invalidate the observation. There were stocks trading for more than 100s of dollars around the same time, and they didn’t do as well as the lower-priced stocks. This insight could mean that ***companies with a lower share price that go for a stock split now have a higher possibility of growth than huge stocks*** like Amazon or Google.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe analysis seems to indicate that stock splits are a sure-shot buy. But there are some caveats to keep in mind before trying to replicate this:\n\n1. There are a variety of large, mid, and small-cap stocks that underwent stock splits. Comparing the returns solely to the S&amp;P 500 might not be the most ideal way to calculate Alpha since the S&amp;P 500 comprises of the biggest 500 companies in the U.S. So the alpha we are seeing here might just be compensating for the extra risk we are taking buying into smaller companies.\n2. The stock splits selected here are companies that have a market cap of at least $1Billion.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBuying and holding stocks at the time they are undergoing a split might not be an outrageously successful strategy - But it definitely has an edge, both in the short term and especially in the long term. This gives some credence to the statement that a stock split indicates good prospects of growth.\n\nAnd if you’re wondering whether the right time to buy is during the announcement or the actual split, the data shows that **there is a clear advantage to buying around the time of the announcement**, especially for short-term plays. The probability of success is also 60% and above in many cases, indicating that there is something more to this than mere chance.\n\nAnd finally, stocks with a smaller price seem to do much better than stocks with higher prices when it comes to stock splits. While this could just be the compensation for the risk you are taking investing in smaller companies, it’s definitely worth looking into!\n\n**Data:** All the raw data for the stock splits and returns for additional time periods that I could not showcase in this article [**can be found here.**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/stock-splits-data-6LUbbrOfFLo2cjV25RoXaQ/live)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] Along similar lines, to own a single Class A share of Berkshire Hathaway, you need $489K. There are some theories that certain companies have very high share prices because they don’t want retail investors (who are usually fickle in ownership) to own their stock. This usually leads to lesser volatility for the said stocks. One other point to consider here is that there are more and more brokers who are offering fractional shares these days. So stock splits might not be as relevant as it was before.\n\n\\[2\\] This should make your life much easier as we had to use web scraping to pull all the data.\n\n\\[3\\] Walmart split its stock [11 times](https://stock.walmart.com/investors/stock-information/dividend-history/default.aspx) on a 2-for-1 basis between their IPO in October 1970 and March 1999.

At 1045am we saw a massive green candle that took SPY all the way back to 450.63 at its high. I really still do not quite have a reason for this candle as there was no new at the time besides paypal/ tesla starting to mine which surely the markets wouldn’t have reacted to. However, the only thing is the VIX at the time saw a massive dive down from its highest peak at 22.34 straight down to 20.28 within two hours. Another massive 10% intraday move. VIX however, found support at 20.28 and ended up creeping it way back un to 21.57 before close which allowed SPY to fall all the way back down to 446.68 during the last 15 minutes and close at 447.57 for a -0.27% day. \n\nThe one thing I take away from this intraday movement today was that we clearly opened red and intended to be red based on the open price action and the end of day price action. Watching the red candles move (before the rip) vs. watching the green candles move (after the rip) showed quite the story. After the massive green candle up SPY sat n range of 450.63 to 448.5 for over 3.25 hours. However, most of that time was spend between 449.1 and 449.8 (1.5 hours of it). \n\nWhile SPY was able to touch 450.63 at its peak it was very clear that 1. 449.9 was massive resistance and very very heard for SPY to stay over for very long and 2. That 449.1 was very heavy support for SPY also. Going into the end of the day it almost looked like SPY would trade within that $0.50 range till close but eventually the bears stepped in, the vix rebounded up and we got a massive 10mil 15min candle reaching a low of 446.68 before settling at 447.57 for the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95v7816wnes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e3e8e4fcea61407a59c774101c8748e8b72d393\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/76ppzkwwnes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99320dc48173bf1ad6cd5d521b73dcbe224baa76\n\n15min chart wise I am watching two channels. I labeled one as purple and one as red. The purple channel is the potential bull rally rest before more bull rally channel. Going into Monday that will give a total range of 453 to 446 to remain in the bullish channel. \n\nThe red bear channel which if you see has some black intra channel lines which really form a nice triple bear channel. We are currently trading in the upper part of that top tier of the triple channel and rejected resistance of it today when we hit 450.63. To remain in the bear channel top tier resistance gives a max of 448 and gives first support at 443 followed by 438 if we break into the middle tier of the channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6y56qixnes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33e64d65b64953786461671b1908b02a325d0816\n\nLooking at the daily channel SPY impressively managed to remain in both the overall bullish red channel and the bearish grey channel today. However, looking at the daily candles we saw a massive gap down that finished in a doji, followed by a green candle to fill the gap, followed by another red doji. I also am seeing the 2nd day in a row that the daily 8ema acted as hard resistance and that SPY failed to close above it. That is a pretty bearish finish in my opinion. In addition, we also saw a dip once again below the daily 20 ema at 447.25 and the 100ema at 446.76. We looked like we were just about to close under the daily 20ema which would have all but ensured a red Monday. \n\nHowever, this is now the third candle that has broken the 20/ 50 ema and that has closed completely under the daily 8ema. It appears it is only a mater of time before we see a close below the 20, 50 and 100 ema below 445.43 and test support at the daily 200ema of 439.98. I believe that day is going to be Monday. \n\nWe also are still seeing a daily MACD sell signal along with a slightly downward RSI at 52. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fetk2i2ynes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a419da17b2e005aadd75813539c147308c53b897\n\nWeekly chart wise it is a bit different than the daily chart. This one has three channels to watch as we find the true move to come. The key take away from this is the doji candle last week above the weekly 20 and 8ema proceeded by the red candle that broke the 8 and 20 ema. Mind you the candle today unfortunately did not close below the weekly 20ema at 446.53, which would have sealed a more confident red week. The candle breaking back below the 8/20 ema is a bearish omen. The weekly 8ema also failed to get above the 20ema this week due to the downside. Weekly chart wise we will look for the candle to break down below the 20ema at 446.53 and the 8ema at 445.11 with a goal of the 50ema at 435.11 as the next support test. \n\nFor me I will 100% be looking for a red open Monday and look for a retrace to 440 Monday. 445 should be pretty strong support as we have seen but after the massive rejection at 450 again today I believe the downside is being built and shape into the market. I also think markets are going to price in CPI data Monday in order to be able to run it up Tuesday if news is better than expected. There is a chance we could see 450-452 Monday and then CPI Tuesday will tank the market down to 440-445 but I give that about a 20% chance vs. the 80% chance I see 440-445 Monday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t33olsoynes81.png?width=852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=046478ba09cb3e0b263d12b2bf85f4eeaa41852a\n\nApple daily bull channel was once again broke today. This time in my opinion a nail in that bull run coffin. We are now looking at a new bear channel (yellow) for next week. With the 10 year yield running so much high today at 2.706 TECH looked extremely weak and will definitely struggle to get some bullish momentum until we see those trickle down. \n\nOne thing that we saw today with APPLE is that it failed after two full candles rejected the daily 8ema completely that today I failed to even break its daily 8ema and it closed under its daily 20 ema. I mentioned yesterday and on Wednesday in my TA that a close under the daily 20ema for Apple is exactly what the bears needed in order to see a potential downside of 165 to 168 this week coming up (daily 50 and daily 100ema). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og8sx17znes81.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=354ae4bf20fb8d43dc656cd1a08d8ab49137e2f2\n\nOn Apples weekly candle the one thing that I am watching for is that we technically are still in a weekly bull channel. The one thing though is that unless Apple can get an unbelievably impossible gap up to 176 it will break the grey bull channel and be within its red bear channel. \n\nThe weekly 8ema at 168.85 was not breached this week but we can with $0.50 of it. I suspect a proper test of that Monday and I suspect we could break below the weekly 8ema and even the weekly 20ema at 165.52. \n\nAs I mentioned in the daily section of apple I fully anticipate a drop and test of the 20 ema weekly support at 165.5 this week and that in and of itself will drag spy down too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5zi3v810oes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f33bd3ee93c97bdbd9c9c9d8513422476230af4\n\nQQQ had a very bearish week this week seeing this nice red bear channel forming. With a current MACD sell signal along with a falling RSI at 47 there is plenty of downside with tech. The 10 year treasury rising to the highest levels in decades is going to make it very hard for tech bulls to get any run this week. Monday range for the red bull channel puts us at 348.7 to 330 (unlimited downside). QQQ would need to see a red pre market that holds and does not allow for break of green otherwise we will be looking for a new channel come Monday to draw. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp2zdwu0oes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5f1adf517d000d2e51827a9cd27106f64c79e5\n\nQQQ weekly chart looks the most bearish of the three. I am seeing a reversal candle last week with a long top wick followed by a very red candle this week that failed to break last weeks highs. This candle broke through the weekly 20, 50 and 8 ema supports. With a close like this for the QQQ weekly candle I highly suspect that we could see a test as low as 320 to 330 next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vq57nki1oes81.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc4b964fec7d65af2c8fee89ed0a3c1672584c81\n\nThe VIX saw a wild swing of a week with beginning of the week lows ranging at 18.5 to the highest of 24.78 on Wednesday. The VIX closed the wek at 21.17 which is pretty much dead nuts middle of the high and low range. That 18.5 low of the VIX is some of the lowest we have seen SPY trade since January 13th. Being that the VIX attempted two times this week and two times last week to unravel below 18.5 but couldn’t says a lot about the markets fear. With the VIX closing this low at 21.17 there is plenty of room for the vix to rebound upward and cause a sell off this week coming up. \n\nHeading into next week we have only a four day week with Friday being good Friday. That means we will NOT have Friday expiations of options, however, we do have OPEX on Thursday for the Monthly options expiring. \n\nWith CPI data coming Tuesday morning. Despite everyone knowing its going to be terrible and I don’t really see how it can not be worse than expected due to inflation, the war, gas prices, covid, etc. My expectation is to see the market price in a terrible CPI Monday and Tuesday the markets will be free to rally if it is as expected or they will tank if it is terrible and then recover. The one thing we need to watch for next week is if CPI is truly terrible whether the feds (JPOW) will do any sort of emergency rate hike, unwinding of QT, balance sheet adjustments, etc. \n\nMy anticipation would be SPY see a red day Monday probably nothing impressive -1% to -1.5% to get us to that key 440-445 level. Overall the one thing I continue to learn every week is that the VIX is the gateway to spy. If you are not watching the VIX and learning its levels you are handicapping yourself. \n\n10% challenge weekly update-\n\nOverall I was able to have a pretty great week this week thankfully. \n\nI made 25 trade. 17 of which were green for a total 68% win rate on the week and averaged +6%/ trade.\n\nInterestingly enough I was 0 for 4 on apple trades which is not normal for me. \n\nMy weekly profit goal is $2500/ week and I was able to return a total of $7004 this week. \n\nSome lessons this week is that I need to manage my risk, I let quite a few losers run for way to long and that hurt not only my account but my % gains for the week. \n\nThe one thing that I want to do this next week is continue to limit my capital/ trade allocation. I saw myself this week start to increase my capital and in doing so I did not decrease the risk with further out expirations. This week I will work on risky trades (0-2dte) using smaller capital and when I feel confident in a trade utilizing 3-5 dte for the increased capital. I also need to make sure I remember to stay humble after a big week so that I do not take a chance of ruining those gains and seeing a revert to mean of my account. \n\nOverall great week for me and the server despite some fuckery in the markets which I do not forsee stopping at any time soon unfortunately.'), ('AMD vs NVDA vs MRVL', 'AMD vs NVDA vs MRVLOkay so I’m being completely transparent I own a lot of NVDA effectively it is artificial intelligence AMD I dumped for NVDA I do want to establish a position into another semi I was curious AMD is a beast but Marvell is a top pick at JPM and Goldman was curious or I can just add to my NVDA position MU doesn’t move much nor does Intel any feedback would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance'), ('Buying SPY puts and calls this week', 'Buying SPY puts and calls this week'), ('Will AMD hold $100?

I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10%.  Oil rose 35% in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5% which is going to shock the markets.  \n\nAnother factor, is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession, but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.

If I can’t see past this thesis, I will likely use any short term boost in the nasdaq to get out of growth.\n\ntl;dr is we are heading into a period of logistic uncertainty, months of inflation and interest rate hikes, huge returns on energy that isn’t going away any time soon and one of the hottest labour markets for tech talent we’ve ever experienced. Any tech company that isn’t close to making money is about to get gutted, and the narrative will shift to how they can become profitable as fast as possible.\n\nMomentum: Short term, it’s working against us. While the SPY and DOW bounced nicely last week, Nasdaq had a failed rally, showing big losses against the other 2 and against a dropping VX. Rare, and this year that’s been a sign of worse to come. MACD is pointing down on the 4HR D W and M. While it should have been leading the rally last week coming off 1hr and 1 Day MA lines, it blew past them or flopped back down. Contrast with the SPY which bounced off its 50HR MA and is riding above its 200 Day MA.  \n\nMicro momentum: We are again seeing cases where companies that are supposedly at their bottom getting great news, big influx of buying, but then an immediate sell-off to worse than when the news broke. This was happening in Jan/Feb (MRNA, TDOC, UPST, DOCN, TTD) and ended up playing out as a big drop. JMIA had a profitable new UPS venture, back to where it started. DNA had great earnings and guidance, back to where it started. Many companies that had great ERs in Feb., have dropped back down as if nothing happened. This is what happens when the news is good/great, the first next bad news will send things lower.\n\nLonger term logistics: Things are not going to get better soon. Shanghai had to go on full lockdown. Whether China keeps this up or lets Covid burn, their population got a faulty vaccine and almost no covid exposure, it’s going to get very bad there. Russia is looking to keep the war going much longer in the East and will likely be more successful, the next round of sanctions are going to cause real pain to western allied countries, which is why we held back on them. In a sentence, physical supply will get worse. Food and fuel will be in very high demand this year, and companies that can benefit from it will make a lot of money. So on the one hand inflation is likely going to keep burning at least a season longer, and anyone wanting to make money in their investments will hug the energy/commodity angle, for now because it’s the right thing to do, and then another leg of mania. Next to 9% dividends in oil, a tech company that plans to make no money until 2026 is going to look very unappealing. \n\nRecession: The labour market is very hot, thanks to immigration having been so low and companies having made so much money through covid. That and the yield issues makes it certainly possible a recession will hit. However, I’m willing to ignore that entirely for now, because whether it comes or not, a mini-recession inside tech is in my opinion very likely. The salaries and bonuses are Wild, capital W. Apple has admitted to the $100-$200k bonuses they’ve had to hand out. Companies that I have some internal awareness of cannot hire decent tech talent within the bands they created, every hire is a new salary exception and anyone of quality is being given raises and bonuses. Again, my opinion, but this has not been priced in to tech. It hasn’t been happening long enough for ERs having to admit the cost of labour has gone up, and the issue of stock based compensation being unappealing in a falling market is only just showing it’s head (SHOP is the first I’ve publicly heard of). This will eventually play out in tech growth having to slow, because they simply can’t justify hiring more at these levels.\n\nPut it all together, and you can try and trade unprofitable small/mid cap tech stock, but the upside is a gamble and the floor is at least if not much lower than we hit last month.'), ('If you bought 1 share of - Microsoft $296 - Apple $169 - Tesla $1,022 - Meta $222 - Nvidia $230 - Amazon $3,080 It would cost you $5,019 Or you could buy $VOO for $410 and get a piece of all of them!', 'If you bought 1 share of - Microsoft $296 - Apple $169 - Tesla $1,022 - Meta $222 - Nvidia $230 - Amazon $3,080 It would cost you $5,019 Or you could buy $VOO for $410 and get a piece of all of them![removed]'), ('Physical Uranium, the ultimate hedge', "Physical Uranium, the ultimate hedge1.

The lack of cashflow and the lack of leverage. Both of these things are abundant in real estate in particular. A good rental multifamily can be expected to have a cap rate of 7-12% with a cash on cash return ideally around 15% or higher. This is because 1: real estate does not rely upon appreciation solely, it relies upon the income it generates from the renters and 2: investment properties typically only need a 20% down payment in order to purchase.\n\nThat’s a 5:1 leverage ratio which would be impossible to achieve safely in the stock market.\n\nNow it used to be that stocks had lower appreciation and higher dividend yields, however that has not been the case for 70 years at least.\n\nYou can take a look at this dividend yield chart of the S&amp;P 500 for reference.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4a42hr13mrs81.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4d2968767da41b9c7914a3b2fb641edbc6d10de\n\n# Luckily, We Can Turn The Stock Market Back Into An Income Machine Using Options\n\nThis is the whole premise of the theta-gang position. We replace our stock appreciation with premiums received from selling options as a sort of “dividend yield.”\n\nSo we turn to selling puts and calls on SPX or SPY or whatever index you prefer. That’s great, but if we compare it back to real estate, we’re still missing the essential component of leverage.\n\n**That’s where leveraged ETFs come in.**\n\nThe pros and cons of LEFTs have been hotly debated, but what settled it for me personally was [this post by hedgefundie](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007) and [this article about volatility decay](https://www.afrugaldoctor.com/home/leveraged-etfs-and-volatility-decay-part-2). If you don't want to read through all of that I've condensed down [the important stuff regarding volatility decay and proper diversification in this post](https://premiumincomeinvestments.substack.com/p/using-debt-to-make-our-portfolio?r=1awcwu&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web). But basically, assuming it works perhaps we can change it from capital appreciation to income generation using options.\n\nSurely that should work right?\n\nWell it should… if we do it correctly to avoid assignment as much as possible.\n\nLeveraged ETFs suffer from something called “volatility decay,” basically just describing the idea that a when a loss is incurred, a greater gain needs to be made to square ourselves back to zero. With leverage we magnify our risk to this factor.\n\nSo because we have more vulnerability to downside, let’s protect ourselves using a bit of probability.\n\n# Using Standard Deviation To Calculate Probabilities\n\nLet’s just assume for the moment that all market movements are as good as being random. Yes, they are based on data, but if we don’t have access to said data, the movements may as well be random.\n\nUnder this assumption we can then also assume that there are probabilities to which direction a stock is going to move. There should be roughly a 50% chance that the stock will go up or down at any given moment.\n\nOn top of that, we could also assume that larger movements are less likely than smaller movements, mainly due to the fact that it takes much larger sudden inflows and outflows of cash to make a stock behave that way. Now some stocks have a “relatively” higher ability to make a significant move in either direction, but even these stocks still have boundaries where they will be unlikely to move.\n\nA good example of this how wild Tesla’s swings are relative to General Electric. Tesla has a higher relative swing compared to General Electric, but even Tesla is unlikely to swing to $30 or $5000 in the next year.\n\nNow these observations we just made are the fundamental ideas behind the concept of “standard deviation.”\n\nStandard deviation essentially says that within a given time frame (usually a year) a stock has a certain probability of being within certain price ranges based on its volatility (its ability to make wild swings like Tesla).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwdu9h3gmrs81.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad20b147792f9eb6d33617c18bd6d4722b526bc9\n\nAs you can see at the bottom of the chart we see that at each increasing or decreasing standard deviation (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, etc) there is less of a probability that our data (or in this case the stock price) will fall into this range given a “normal distribution.”\n\nIf you add up all the percentages between -1 and 1 we get a 68.2% chance that our stock price will fall in this range. This is called the first standard deviation. If we expand out the -2 and 2 then we get a 95.4% chance that our stock price will fall within the range. That is called the second standard deviation. If we go out to the 3 on each side we get a 98.8% chance that the stock price will fall within the range. With each standard deviation the chance that a stock price will fall within the range gets higher, albeit at a much slower rate.\n\n# So What Does This Have To Do With Selling Options?\n\nUsing these standard deviations we can get probabilities that a stock will fall within a certain range. If we use something called Implied Volatility we can figure out what the market thinks that one standard deviation is. Then using that, we can predict what probability our option has of expiring in the money (which is what we don’t want).\n\nTo find implied volatility we can go to a website like volafy.net and get the implied volatility percentage. In the case of TQQQ (QQQ leveraged 3x) the implied volatility is 65.40% at this time of writing.\n\nUsing this percentage we can plug it into a handy formula to calculate the standard deviation for any specific option.\n\nThe formula looks like this:\n\n(sqrt(option days until expiration/365)) \\* implied volatility \\* current stock price\n\nIn written terms basically we divide the days until expiration by 365, then take the square root of that and multiply it by the implied volatility percentage and the current stock price.\n\nThat gives us the amount in dollars of the first standard deviation. If you take that amount and add it AND subtract it from the current price it will give you the range the stock will fall within 68% of the time.\n\nRight now we are interested in selling puts on TQQQ without getting exercised, so we’ll sell at one standard deviation out of the money. At the current price of TQQQ ($51.84) the first standard deviation out of the money would be $38.11 (which is also 51.84 - 13.73).\n\nIf we go back up to our standard deviation chart we can see that on the left side of the chart (the side that represents our OTM options) we can add up all the percentages before the 1st standard deviation mark. This comes out to be a 15.9% that our OTM option will become ITM by expiration (you might have noticed that this percentage closely correlates with the delta of the option which is a good way to gauge it as well). If we are selling monthly options, this comes out to be getting assigned once out of every six months on average. To me, those seem like pretty good odds.\n\nSo let’s go down to the $38 strike put on TQQQ which is trading $128 per contract right now. That’s a 3.37% ROI in 40 days or 30.75% annually.\n\nIf we assume assignment three times a year that wipes out any premiums made for that given month we are still sitting on a 20.64% CAGR.\n\n# But Wait, Isn’t This Riskier Than Selling Puts On Regular Old QQQ?\n\nThis is the beauty of it, you have the same risk of getting assigned on TQQQ as you do with QQQ if you stay at the same standard deviation, but still receive 3x the premium. This is because with TQQQ higher volatility we sell further OTM than we would with regular QQQ but still receive the high premiums due to it being a leveraged product.\n\nIf you do happen to get assigned, no worries! Personally I would recommend that you simply just sell out of the position at the current price and open a new put for the next month. The reason why I say this as opposed to selling a call is that calls do not have the same volatility risk premium that puts do, and therefore do not sell for as much. If you want to read more there is [this paper](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.4882&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) which discusses the outperformance of a put writing only strategy that outperforms during bear/flat markets. If you open a new put, you are simply taking the loss for that month with the intention that the high win rate probability of this trading strategy will make you square again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS STRATEGY ON ANYTHING BESIDES INDEXES, if you do chances are that eventually that stock will get wiped out and never recover (I'm looking at you TLRY). Indexes on the other hand, do recover, you don't need to look any further than this chart to prove it.\n\n[S&amp;P 500 Returns](https://preview.redd.it/1k162vyxprs81.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdf97a8cbe87ba97b5d67e1795a2f51b92feb71b)\n\nTLDR; Sell puts on TQQQ way OTM instead of buying them.

After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my -2% red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20, 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days. \n\nThe bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesn’t have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema (above for bearish and below for bullish). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hpw0uyrqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e988c2486c9a35886e64c0572dda7db4c7f52f\n\nWe actually established yet another downward channel today that I don’t suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nzmwaslsqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=460f3ed4daf222a62703d594bc51c6a74e98085e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/li7lzt7tqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4347b8f4c091377d1ce4fba1560a3adac832fe92\n\nWe are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse. \n\nBut on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I don’t really forsee (unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10% that we do it) but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gk5l6gstqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1186f1a49dfdb4c8482bfe6b8db71a3e6c0a15d\n\nThe daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14m0bnhuqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb628bb79afa7a42f5d89e96ee5161666ca6c136\n\nThe daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20, 50 and 100 ema on the daily (445.21, 446.55 and 446.63) but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised (again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected) for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside. \n\nChannel support is 437 and resistance is 451 (unlimited upside) BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I don’t suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7xoaqpvqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7116303960c6b14d65486a7a6055fe9d2f6ebe3b\n\nWeekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However, we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema (443.96, 445.9). The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 (weekly 50). \n\nAnother thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday (monthly option expiration). \n\nWednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p. \n\nThursday monthly has 15k 445c, 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p, 66k 435p, 113k 430p.\n\nThat is a massive amount of OI to the downside that’s expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps, we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too. \n\nWith the last CPI being 7.5%, expected at 7.9% but the consensus at 8.4% its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war, gas prices, more covid, etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9%. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvve2nvwqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6cb5a86ef7f0a6606d8305928378625e0d55be0\n\nApple had a heck of a red day today too (mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today). I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not, however, expect it to happen today. However, I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning. \n\nApple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel, with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However, my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here. \n\nChannel support tomorrow is 157 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However, if Apple loses 165.54 (daily 100ema) we can expect further downside this week. \n\nI currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may re-enter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rvihq1qxqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=815d5abea3eb8fcfa988a512045e85dccccf6818\n\nThe blood for AMD just continues, but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive -5.2 hit which I believe it was down around -6% at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 72-74. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right. \n\nI am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema (tomorrow most likely) to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h42lt6cyqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=656bccd6c7693ffbff25068cf8b80b2484feb77c\n\nFord attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5%, however, after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.\n\nFord also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I don’t suspect the RSI to be an issue. \n\nAgain took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26yjjyxyqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e647a1487ff5cbb7889db0f47334e17a6429f2b\n\nQQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how. \n\nChannel support is 322 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 342 for tomorrow. \n\nI also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420-430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qghek3jzqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50292337467bbf1fd1b3d55a377e4955d987401b\n\nThe VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11% from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels, but mind you that was on the downside not the upside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dkbfa40rzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718eb38d4ea8f47c4467f046cff1e33dd4fed944\n\nWhen you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI. \n\nOverall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising, 30 year fixed mortgages rising again, the inverted treasury yields, inflation, covid, war, gas, etc. etc. etc. recession, etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two. \n\nWhile some don’t think it’s a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of... took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling that’s the pre-ample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19%, a spy put for 20% and a call for 20%. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70% at open that spiked to -30% around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at -30%. I also played a call and put for -25% then -10% during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10% puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal, however, factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy has called for additional European Union sanctions against Russia, including oil and all banks.\n\n# SPY - April 13 - Technical Analysis\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qs74jhuh17t81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be13cedcc5814c4e52662990a02183d8a278237c\n\n* Break 439.76 and look for 441.71\n* Break 441.71 and look for 441.71 - 442.58\n* Beak 442.58 and look for 444.58 - 445.87 - 447.02\n* Lose 437.73 - 436.63 - 435.53 and look for 433.86\n* Lose 433.86 and look for 432.13 - 430.27\n* Lose 430.27 and look for 428.70\n* Lose 428.70 and look for 426.89 - 425.20\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5t8zizj17t81.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc782a28de6cc9e2e96312fe571af8abe9ebffb\n\n## Wedge - Bullish Bias\n\n* Bullish 🎯: 445.88 - 450.27 ( needs to break 442.42)\n* Lose 433.79 and the pattern is null.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqzckazl17t81.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aea891d0351e0538585f73feb784225c3213463b\n\n* Neutral 440-449.

I believe the correction is over and the market has now gotten more used to a more hawkish fed.\n\nThe fed has gotten more Hawkish due to inflation, which I believe will begin stabilizing and even subsiding over the next several quarters.   \nPrimarily because  :  \n1- Consumer demand and spending has been declining for two months and will continue to do so IMO, due to a moderation of govt spending bills, stimulus money running out and savings declining.\n\n2- Because inflation of energy prices due to the Russian-Ukaranian war have mostly already been baked in since March.\n\nSlowing inflation can give leeway to the fed to turn less hawkish, which can fuel a major bull market rally.  \n\\-- AMD\'s Fundamental Picture --  \nAMD\'s price has gone down by nearly half since its major peak last year at around \\~$160  \nNothing fundamental about AMD\'s business has changed . The company even raised its growth expectations for 2022 in its last earnings call. AMD is expected to grow its revenue by no less than 60% by the end of the year and more than double its profit.  \nDemand for semiconductors continues to be very strong and will remain so for the remainder of the year.  \nAMD successfully completed its acquisition of XLNX late last year, which strengthens AMD\'s competitive position in the server business, and area where the company has been kicking ass and taking record breaking market share from Intel.  In fact more than a quarter of all x86 CPUs sold today are AMD, the [highest market share](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-amd-4q-2021-2022-market-share-desktop-notebook-server-x86) in the history of the company.\n\nThe company is also expected to release the first ever 5nm x86 "Zen 4" CPUs [this year](https://www.techspot.com/news/92835-amd-ces-2022-roadmap-zen-4-am5-ryzen.html), which would extend its manufacturing process lead vs Intel and allow it capture even more market share and grow profitability and margins.\n\n\\-- AMD\'s Technical Picture --\n\n1- I believe AMD has bottomed here at the \\~$90 level.  \nWhy?  \n\\- We tagged the 100-day moving average for the first time since April 2018. The last time this happened AMD went up from $10 to $30 in six months.  \n\\- We hit a double bottom on the daily RSI after a major peak. The last time this happened was Dec 2018 and AMD went up by 60% the following 6 weeks.  \n\\- AMD has been on a very strong bullish trendline since 2016. The stock just entered the most attractive green buy zone on my hand drawn pitchfork channel. This has only happened 3 times in the last 5 years.

The Anti Echo Chamber Business model.', "How to turn Twitter into a Trillion dollar company, Elon Musk style. The Anti Echo Chamber Business model.Elon musk Is a wild crazy man thing. His motivations are as mysterious as his methods. Though he may be enigmatic, I believe there are clues to suggest his true intentions with twitter. I therefore propose my theory to explain the potential Elon musk claims to be capable of unlocking.\n\nTo begin, one must look at the current state of the market surrounding social media platforms and in doing so you may notice a few things.\n\nSocial media platforms are extremely associated with an “identity.” facebook is for old folks, reddit is for neckbeards and niche fandoms, instagram is for influencers and their fancy lives, and twitter of course, is for the filthy scum sucking degenerate libs. (you blue blooded democrats are cool don't worry.)  \n\nAmerica is the most divided It has been in quite a while. Everywhere you look there are people complaining about something. Whether its covid politics, Ukraine strategic assistance, inflation and the cause, divisive media bias, shit leadership from both parties, the greedy pedophilic corporate elite, the list goes on. Perhaps It was always this way, but the internet, and especially social media has the power to amplify and focus these issues and put them in the forefront of the minds of the general public.\n\nThe war over what defines free speech is reaching a climax. There is a propaganda war between the west and the east. Nato vs the Russians and chinese. As a result of this and many other issues, the demand for good information, for good educated opinions that aren't trying to scam you or trick you into an ideology you don't respect grows by the day. Fears that important information is being repressed by someone or something clash with fears that wild misinformation is spreading like wildfire among the general public. There is now a sufficient market for a platform that enables proper, unfiltered discourse and finally,\n\nElon musk fucking loves twitter. He uses it like a teenager uses crusty socks. His Mindset surrounding twitter and how it should be used has remained consistent for quite a few years now, as evidenced by his many hot takes, and this interview he gave a while back. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9kwFFhdf8&amp;ab\\_channel=60Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9kwFFhdf8&amp;ab_channel=60Minutes)\n\nElon musk has stated that he wants to fix twitter and make it a bastion of free speech, but what does he mean by that? Well in order for free speech to function properly as defined by the constitution you must have 3 things. Stupidity, Apathy, and pain. People start out Apathetic until stupidity rears its ugly head. Stupidity causes pain, anger, and the drive to change minds. Apathy therefore, when exposed to stupidity, creates knowledge and experience. That knowledge and experience cures stupidity. \n\nNow normally, this all results in war. One side believes one ideolgy, the other side gets pissed and thinks the apposing side is stupid, thus armies are raised and wars are fought. However, under the laws of the United States as well as most civilized countries, physically harming someone just because you disagree is illegal. Thus the only option to fight something you disagree with is to do so with ideas. A war of Ideas if you will, for example the civil rights movement.\n\nThis, by the way, is the core definition of philosophy, and philosophy is the backbone of modern human society, and in many ways an extension of religion. As philosophy evolves and matures, human society evolves and matures with it. It is therefore of utmost importance to ensure that philosophy can thrive as that is the only way for humanity to continue to grow in a positive direction. \n\nNow I hear you ask, “what does this have to do with anything you fucking baboon?” well here's the rub. The single biggest problem with social media and perhaps American free speech culture in general is that people want to skip over the “pain” part of the free speech equation. We don't want to hear some idiot talk about vaccine microchips. We don't want to watch some orange fuck babble on about his hands. We aren't interested in things that challenge the echo chamber and so rather than participate in the war of ideas companies like twitter simply ban controversial people off their platform and proclaim the problem solved. They take the easy way out, and unfortunately just like how removing the sodium from salt creates a deadly gas, this doesn't allow stupidity the chance to heal through knowledge and experience. Instead it festers and grows stronger and stronger as attention is brought to the controversy and people start playing for the underdog side. Why do they do this?  Because as much as people hate pain and debate, we absolutely ADORE controversy. The media never lets a good tragedy go to waste. School shootings get more clicks than puppy adoptions after all. \n\nSo this is the philosophical backbone of the change Elon seems to want to create in twitter. Say What you will about Elons hypocrisy when it comes to criticisms of his companies and his life, he loves the fight. He says as much in his interviews about his views on Twitter, and proves as much with his frequent hot takes. \n\nNow we get to the  business side of things. In order to turn twitter into a real money maker while maintaining the promise of free speech, the only way to do it is to take advantage of twitters greatest strength, which is the thrill of engagement it provides users. Here is what I would do.\n\n1. **Reform twitter's content algorithm.**\n\nRather than avoid controversy, *embrace it.* You do this by adding a new feature, an alternative to the retweet that I call ***squawk***. This would function like the opposite of the retweet feature, instead of promoting tweets you like, this would promote things you don't like. Sounds insane? Just you wait because it gets good.\n\n2. **Allow tweets and squawks to be filtered by location**.\n\nAllow users to narrow down the area they wish to view tweets or squawks in. want to know what people are mad about in new york? What people are loving about England right now? What people are pissed about in America? You can narrow down what content you see to location, as precise as your local town or as wide as the whole world and know with just a few clicks what everyones on about. \n\n3. **Retweets and Squawks MUST include a comment**. \n\nThis would have a minimum character requirement that would potentially be adjusted depending on user engagement.  The primary purpose would be to facilitate interesting commentary, either positive or negative depending on if it's a retweet or a squawk, while also defending against bots and mass mob attacks since an algorithm to detect abuses in the system would be easy to set up. \n\n**Include a retweet/Squawk ratio system**.\n\nKeep it hidden or keep it visible, but the purpose is to locate people who actually deserve to be kicked off twitter for illegal activity. For example people who promote and threaten violence, people engaging in blatant illegal activity such as promoting childporn or sex trafficing, the sort of shit that doesn't fly even under free speech absolutionest values. Content that sees a certain retweet to squawk ratio will be flagged for manual review to determine if someone needs to be removed. It's basically a report system except everyone can see who's being reported and everyone is emotionally charged to keep the snowball rolling. With this method, you don't need an algorithm to flag people who need to be removed since anyone who actually deserves it will be essentially mobbed off the platform through a democratic process.\n\n**Apply a weight system**. \n\nThis would promote tweets based on follower count and retweet/squawk amount. Famous people are more likely to be on the front page, but a nobody still has a chance based on luck, it would be like the youtube algorithm and the reddit upvote system combined. \n\n**Start marketing!**\n\nTwitter has an identity problem that causes it to be associated exclusively with the far left. It may be expensive, but an extensive marketing campaign centering on free speech absolutism will likely draw many people in, even if many leftists get mad and leave since they now have to put up a fight for what they believe in. \n\n**le coup de grâce.**\n\nCharge a subscription fee to participate on the platform. This does NOT need to be expensive, a simple 2$ a month charge would likely double twitter's current revenue, and the creativity with the subscription service knows no boundaries. Charge people more for double the characters? Sure. make special meme emojis for premium members? Why not! Give out cash rewards for people who reach a certain amount of followers because they have killer hot takes? Sign me up! Take inspiration from video game microtransactions. The only thing that matters here is that people are engaged with the platform enough to pay a small premium every month. Sure it pushes out people with no credit cards, or debit cards, or bank accounts, or money, but honestly I think being homeless and getting a job just so you can afford to shitpost on twitter is worth it. \n\n**Extend to the coin market.** \n\nThis is where things get hard to predict, but allowing people to bypass any data collection through a twitter built vpn system while allowing them to tweet anyway and pay for the privilege in coin would potentially open up opportunity in countries that are notoriously authoritarian. This unfortunately would only work if twitter gets enough users, but would potentially give twitter a strings free presence in any country that has internet access. All other countries would likely allow twitter presence, perhaps under the condition that some money made off the citizens gets paid to the government, and in return twitter retains complete and total control over the platform. Finally, free speech exported to every country, monopolized for profit! \n\nThe standard twitter experience, or as I call it the Anti Echo Chamber, would essentially work  like this. Load up twitter, sort by the typical filters, as well as area filters to view tweets near you, and be immediately blasted by whatever the most contentious thing is that people are currently going off on. Maybe it's good news! Maybe somebody you know has cancer and is getting support through retweets! Maybe people are bickering about local housing prices, or a new roundabout in town and whether roundabouts are the safest way to direct traffic. Maybe Alex Jones said something crazy for the trillienth time and people are freaking the fuck out about it. Maybe legions of Biden lovers are shaming and squawking against the Trumpists about Trump's most recent racial slur he let slip on video in 1979. Maybe bill burr said something hilarious about someone  in his squawk and now his squawk is being retweeted as a retweet and people are retweeting a squawk of a retweet of a squawk. This shit could get chaotic and meta fast and the only thing I know for sure is that it would be exciting. \n\nIn conclusion, this system would prey on people's sensitive emotions like a vulture preys on a juicy meaty, rotten cow. Clever engagement on any issue would be rewarded with followers. Influencers could rise from absolutely nowhere overnight, gain a massive following, and be canceled and clowned on just as quickly if they aren't careful with how they phrase their ideas, or they could pivot into political or entertainment roles with their newfound following. The more momentum a tweet, retweet or squawk gains, the more exposure it gets. Entire movements could rise and fall like mountains clashing and absolutely all of it would guarantee cashflow for twitter, therefore free speech is maintained since there would be direct financial incentive to insure it. Why delete someone off the platform when you can make so much money off them?  It's the gold rush situation, but the gold is free speech and twitter would sell the shovels. \n\nQuestions and answers. \n\n**1.why has this not been done?**\n\nThe reason something like this does not exist anywhere is because it is extremely extremely difficult to start up a social media platform. A normal platform needs hundreds of thousands of users to function properly. This is not a normal platform. The issue is that in order for the anti echo chamber system to work, you need as MANY people from as MANY backgrounds and beliefs as you can possibly get. If you only have a few hundred thousand it can't work. If you only have a few million it can't work. You absolutely must have hundreds of millions of users or the system simply falls apart into a toxic hellhole. This is why competitors like truth social or gab will simply never work. The only way to create a functional anti echo chamber is to start out with hundreds of millions of users from the very beginning and luckily twitter is perfect for that. \n\n**2. Isn't reddit alot like this?**\n\nNo. reddit may be the closest thing to an anti echo chamber that exists currently, however while you can find subreddits for anything you want, you have to actually find them. Therefore subreddits become their own echo chamber and there is no system in place to break them apart and expose them to alternative views and beliefs. The upvote downvote system is similar to what I propose, however unlike the upvote downvote system you have to add commentary that elaborates on your reason for upvoting or downvoting, which helps protect against bot abuse and others trying to abuse the system. \n\n**3. Won’t trolls gain the spotlight?**\n\nThis is possible, but more and more unlikely the more people participate on the platform. This is why it's so important to have as many people as possible to start with. A troll saying “I hate nigs” may get a few squawks, but at the end of the day nobody will pay any attention and the tweet will die in the void. However somebody making claims about faulty pfizer research techniques and linking video evidence will receive a massive amount of exposure through either retweets or squawks, snowballing the exposure, and in turn increasing the likelihood of somebody who actually knows what they are talking about responding in kind with their own research and gaining even more exposure through retweets and squawks combined, propelling the entire debate to twitters front page. What the general public decided on depends entirely on what would essentially be a democratic process\n\n**4. Wouldn't this increase the risk of exposure to misinformation?**\n\nSmall yes, but BIG no. the thing we all know about the internet is that people fucking LOVE to prove others wrong. Putting someone in their fucking spot with facts, logic, and a snarky comment will get far more exposure then simply posting false info about election fraud with little context. Simply put, if it's actually true, people will notice and kick the can forward for more people to review, retweet, or squawk about. In the words of the great howard todd, it just works. \n\n**5. Wouldn’t people get tired of seeing things they don't like and just quit, concentrating the pool of toxicity?**\n\nAgain, this relies on there being a big enough user base to filter out anything actually dangerous, misleading, and wrong. Ideas and opinions that reach maximum exposure will only do so if there is actually merit and intelligence behind them, with the exception of tweets that reach certain thresholds in the retweet to squawk ratio and are promptly detected, reviewed, and removed. Don't like it? Then fight back! If what you believe in is truly worth it to you, you will have the strength to stand up for it. As Elon Musk says, twitter is a warzone and you better be ready to duke it out with anyone who disagrees with you. \n\n**6. Isn't this just the reddit sort by controversy?** \n\nKind of?

The Anti Echo Chamber Model.', "How to turn Twitter into a Trillion Dollar Company, Elon Musk style. The Anti Echo Chamber Model.A quick forward: this is an analysis of a potential new product using the existing twitter framework and user base as a foundation. This is not a prediction of stock performance, or really anything at all and purely represents my opinions on the current state of social media and the potential for a new kind of competitive service to be introduced. I have no positions. what advice I will give is that if in the future Elon takes twitter private, you have a large amount of capital, and twitter starts to show signs of going where I am showing in this post, you better contact him and beg for a door in. I am posting here because the other stock subreddits are to picky about rules to post on. \n\nElon musk Is a wild crazy man… thing. His motivations are as mysterious as his methods. Though he may be enigmatic, I believe there are clues to suggest his true intentions with twitter. I therefore propose my theory to explain the potential Elon musk claims to be capable of unlocking.\n\nTo begin, one must look at the current state of the market surrounding social media platforms and in doing so you may notice a few things.\n\nSocial media platforms are extremely associated with an “identity.'' Facebook is for old folks, reddit is for neckbeards and niche fandoms, instagram is for influencers and their fancy lives, and twitter of course, is for the filthy hypocrite, fascist, scum sucking, baby eating, degenerate libs. (you blue blooded democrats are cool don't worry.)\n\nAmerica is the most divided It has been in quite a while. Everywhere you look there are people complaining about something. Whether its covid politics, Ukraine strategic assistance, inflation and the cause, divisive media bias, shit leadership from both parties, the greedy pedophilic corporate elite, the list goes on. Perhaps It was always this way, but the internet, and especially social media has the power to amplify and focus these issues and put them in the forefront of the minds of the general public.\n\nThe war over what and how we should define free speech is reaching a climax. There is a propaganda war between the west and the east. Nato vs the Russians and chinese. As a result of this and many other issues, the demand for good information, for good educated opinions that aren't trying to scam you and misinform you into an ideology you don't respect grows by the day. Fears that important information is being repressed by someone or something clash with fears that wild misinformation is spreading like wildfire among the general public. There is now a sufficient market for a platform that enables proper, unfiltered discourse and finally,\n\nElon musk fucking loves twitter. He uses twitter like a teenager uses crusty socks. His Mindset surrounding twitter and how it should be used has remained consistent for quite a few years now, as evidenced by his many hot takes, and this interview he gave a while back. \\[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9kwFFhdf8&amp;ab\\\\\\_channel=60Minutes\\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9kwFFhdf8&amp;ab_channel=60Minutes])\n\nElon musk has stated that he wants to fix twitter and make it a bastion of free speech, but what does he mean by that? Well in order for free speech to function properly as defined by the constitution you must have 3 things. Stupidity, Apathy, and pain. People start out Apathetic until stupidity rears its ugly head. Stupidity causes pain, anger, and the drive to change minds. Apathy therefore, when exposed to stupidity, creates knowledge and experience. That knowledge and experience cures stupidity.\n\nNow normally, this all results in war. One side believes one ideolgy, the other side gets pissed and thinks the apposing side is stupid, thus armies are raised and wars are fought. However, under the laws of the United States as well as most civilized countries, physically harming someone just because you disagree is illegal.  The only option you have to fight something you disagree with is to do so with ideas and evidence. A war of Ideas if you will, for example the civil rights movement, the anti war movement during vietnam, and the current “woke vs right” movement of today.\n\nThis, by the way, is the definition of philosophy, and philosophy is the backbone of modern human society, as well as the mature form of religion.  Both are protected under the constitution.  As philosophy evolves and matures, human society evolves and matures with it. It is therefore of utmost importance to ensure that philosophy can thrive as that is the only way for humanity to continue to grow in a positive direction.\n\nNow I hear you ask, “what does this have to do with anything you damn baboon?” well here's the rub. The single biggest problem with social media and perhaps American free speech culture in general is that people want to skip over the “pain” part of the free speech equation. We don't want to hear some idiot talk about vaccine microchips. We don't want to watch some orange fuck babble on about his hands. We aren't interested in things that challenge the echo chamber and so rather than participate in the war of ideas companies like twitter simply ban controversial people off their platform and proclaim the problem solved.  In the words of the great Joseph Stalin, “no person no problem” Twitter, as well as many far left/ far right political parties, prefer to take the easy way out, and unfortunately just like how removing the sodium from salt creates a deadly gas, this doesn't allow stupidity the chance to heal through knowledge and experience. Instead it festers and grows stronger and stronger as attention is brought to the controversy and people start playing for the underdog side. Why do they do this?  Because as much as people hate the misery of pain and debate, we absolutely ADORE controversy. The media never lets a good tragedy go to waste. School shootings get more clicks than puppy adoptions, and east european political, social, and military tragedy is more interesting then a global pandemic .\n\nSo this is the philosophical backbone of the change Elon seems to want to create on twitter. Say What you will about Elons hypocrisy when it comes to criticisms of his companies and his life, he loves the fight. He says as much in his interviews about his views on Twitter, and proves as much with his frequent hot takes.\n\nNow we get to the  business side of things. In order to turn twitter into a real money maker while maintaining the promise of free speech, the only way to do it is to take advantage of twitter's greatest strength, which is the thrill of engagement it provides users. It's the public square of the U.S, and perhaps one day the entire world, and has the potential to be THE place everyone goes to see what the biggest problems in the world are, and what we can do about it. In order to take advantage of this, Here is what I would do. I call it the Anti Echo Chamber.\n\n**Reform twitter's content algorithm.**\n\nRather than avoid controversy, \\*embrace it.\\* You do this by adding a new feature, an alternative to the retweet that I call \\*\\*\\*squawk\\*\\*\\*. This would function like the opposite of the retweet feature, instead of promoting tweets you like, this would promote things you don't like. Sounds insane? Just you wait because it gets good.\n\n**Allow tweets and squawks to be filtered by location**\n\nAllow users to narrow down the area they wish to view tweets or squawks in. want to know what people are mad about in new york? What people are loving about England right now? What people are pissed about in America? You can narrow down what content you see to location, as precise as your local town or as wide as the whole world and know with just a few clicks what everyones on about.\n\n**Install more anti bot systems.**\n\nThis could be done any number of ways, some creative, some direct. it would likely take time to experiment in order to get right. What is important is that we greatly increase the difficulty of making vast amounts of duplicate fake accounts, and ensure that everyone who participates on twitter has an IDENTITY that they would have great difficulty in changing. This is required in order to self-inforce personal accountability among all users.\n\n**Retweets and Squawks MUST include a comment**\n\nThis would have a minimum character requirement that would potentially be adjusted depending on user engagement.  The primary purpose would be to facilitate interesting commentary, either positive or negative depending on if it's a retweet or a squawk, while also defending against bots and mass mob attacks since an algorithm to detect abuses in the system would be easy to set up.\n\n**Include a retweet/Squawk ratio system**\n\nKeep it hidden or keep it visible, but the purpose is to locate people who actually deserve to be kicked off twitter for illegal activity. For example people who promote and threaten violence, people engaging in blatant illegal activity such as promoting childporn or sex trafficing, the sort of shit that doesn't fly even under free speech absolutionest values. Content that sees a certain retweet to squawk ratio will be flagged for manual review to determine if someone needs to be removed. It's basically a report system except everyone can see who's being reported and everyone is emotionally charged to keep the snowball rolling. With this method, you don't need an algorithm to flag people who need to be removed since anyone who actually deserves it will be essentially mobbed off the platform through a democratic process.\n\n**Apply a weight system or adjust the current one.**\n\nThis would promote tweets based on follower count and retweet/squawk amount. Famous people are more likely to be on the front page, but a nobody still has a chance based on luck, it would be like the youtube algorithm and the reddit upvote system combined.\n\n**Start marketing!**\n\nTwitter has an identity problem that causes it to be associated exclusively with the far left. It may be expensive, but an extensive marketing campaign centering on free speech absolutism will likely draw many people in, even if many leftists get mad and leave since they now have to put up a fight for what they believe in.\n\n***le coup de grâce.***\n\nCharge a subscription fee to participate on the platform. This does NOT need to be expensive, a simple 2$ a month charge would likely double twitter's current revenue, and the creativity with the subscription service knows no boundaries. Charge people more for double the characters? Sure. make special meme emojis for premium members? Why not! Give out cash rewards for people who reach a certain amount of followers because they have killer hot takes? Sign me up! Take inspiration from video game microtransactions. The only thing that matters here is that people are engaged with the platform enough to pay a small premium every month. Sure it pushes out people with no credit cards, or debit cards, or bank accounts, or money, but honestly I think being homeless and getting a job just so you can afford to shitpost on twitter is worth it.\n\n**Extend to the coin market.**\n\nThis is where things get hard to predict, but allowing people to bypass any data collection through a twitter built vpn system while allowing them to tweet anyway and pay for the privilege in coin would potentially open up opportunity in countries that are notoriously authoritarian. This unfortunately would only work if twitter gets enough users, but would potentially give twitter a strings free presence in any country that has internet access. All other countries would likely allow twitter presence, perhaps under the condition that some money made off the citizens gets paid to the government, and in return twitter retains complete and total control over the platform. Think of a Twitter/nord vpn combo that provides both services, and can only be paid for in coin. I am unfamiliar with how easy it is to access vpns in countries that censor internet service, but it would be a very interesting project and if done right, would make twitter untouchable from government influence. Web 3 anyone? Starlink anyone? Finally, free speech exported to every country, monopolized for profit!\n\nIn summary, The twitter algorithm would function based on these parameters that would see adjustment after reviewing user engagement and membership growth.\n\n* Number of followers\n* Number of retweets\n* Number of squawks\n* A verification of authenticity given depending on retweet/squawk ratio, and follower count.\n* Location of both the tweet user, and an average follower location, Except in the case of the vpn service, which would ignore these parameters and focus on the previous ones exclusively. This should in theory account for limited users and followers in countries that do not have the same free speech laws that others do.\n* Any current existing parameters that do not contradict the previous ones given.\n\nThe standard twitter experience, or as I call it the Anti Echo Chamber, would essentially work like this. Load up twitter, sort by the typical filters, as well as area filters to view tweets near you, and be immediately blasted by whatever the most contentious thing is that people are currently going off on. Maybe it's good news! Maybe somebody you know has cancer and is getting support through retweets! Maybe the town mayor is asking for an opinion on a new policy currently under debate. Maybe people are bickering about local housing prices, or a new roundabout in town and whether roundabouts are the safest way to direct traffic. Maybe Alex Jones said something crazy for the trillienth time and people are freaking the fuck out about it. Maybe legions of Biden lovers are shaming and squawking against the Trumpists about Trump's most recent racial slur he let slip on video in 1979. Maybe bill burr said something hilarious about someone in his squawk and now his squawk is being retweeted as a retweet and people are retweeting a squawk of a retweet of a squawk. This shit could get chaotic and meta fast and the only thing I know for sure is that it would be exciting.\n\nIn conclusion, this system would prey on people's sensitive emotions like a vulture preys on a juicy meaty, rotten cow. Clever engagement on any issue would be rewarded with followers. Influencers could rise from absolutely nowhere overnight, gain a massive following, and be canceled and clowned on just as quickly if they aren't careful with how they phrase their ideas, or they could pivot into political or entertainment roles with their newfound following. The more momentum a tweet, retweet or squawk gains, the more exposure it gets. Entire movements could rise and fall like mountains clashing, sparks could fan into flames at a moment's notice. absolutely all of it would guarantee cashflow for twitter, therefore free speech is maintained since there would be direct financial incentive to insure it. Why delete someone off the platform when you can make so much money off them?  It's the gold rush situation, but the gold is free speech and twitter would sell the shovels.\n\n*Questions and answers.*\n\n**why has this not been done?**\n\nThe reason something like this does not exist anywhere is because it is extremely extremely difficult to start up a social media platform. A normal platform needs hundreds of thousands of users to function properly. This is not a normal platform. The issue is that in order for the anti echo chamber system to work, you need as MANY people from as MANY backgrounds and beliefs as you can possibly get. If you only have a few hundred thousand it can't work. If you only have a few million it can't work. You absolutely must have hundreds of millions of users or the system simply falls apart into a toxic hellhole. This is why competitors like truth social or gab will simply never work. The only way to create a functional anti echo chamber is to start out with hundreds of millions of users from the very beginning and luckily twitter is perfect for that.  Here is a wikipedia article that dives deeper into what this is and why this type of system is so sensitive.  (you need participation from everyone of every belief system.)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom\\_of\\_the\\_crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd)\n\n**Isn't reddit alot like this?**\n\nNo. reddit may be the closest thing to an anti echo chamber that exists currently, however while you can find subreddits for anything you want, you have to actually find them. Therefore subreddits become their own echo chamber and there is no system in place to break them apart and expose them to alternative views and beliefs. The upvote downvote system is similar to what I propose, however unlike the upvote downvote system you have to add commentary that elaborates on your reason for upvoting or downvoting, which helps protect against bot abuse and others trying to abuse the system. Interestingly enough, the youtube algorithm has recently been changed to represent this type of system almost better than anything else out there currently. Why? Because they removed the dislike button of all things! This is not evidence, but an example that somewhat portrays what I'm talking about. If you know anything about Elden Ring, you know that the majority consensus is that it's fantastic. However this video that spends almost 2 hours trashing the game design managed to get on trending. In the first few minutes he explains through a joke, what is essentially my argument for why my new twitter algorithm would work. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEyjdc-DIb8&amp;ab\\_channel=JosephAnderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEyjdc-DIb8&amp;ab_channel=JosephAnderson)\n\n**Won’t trolls gain the spotlight?**\n\nThis is possible, but more and more unlikely the more people participate on the platform. This is why it's so important to have as many people as possible, from as many ideologies as possible, at the very start. A troll saying “I hate nigs” may get a few squawks, but at the end of the day nobody will pay any attention and the tweet will die in the void. However somebody making claims about faulty pfizer research techniques and linking video evidence will receive a massive amount of exposure through either retweets or squawks, snowballing the exposure, and in turn increasing the likelihood of somebody who actually knows what they are talking about responding in kind with their own research and gaining even more exposure through retweets and squawks combined, propelling the entire debate to twitters front page. What the general public decided on depends entirely on what would essentially be a democratic, albeit emotionally charged debate.\n\n**Wouldn't this increase the risk of exposure to misinformation?**\n\nSmall yes, but BIG no. the thing we all know about the internet is that people fucking LOVE to prove others wrong. Putting someone in their fucking spot with facts, logic, and a snarky comment will get far more exposure then simply posting false info about election fraud with little context. Simply put, if it's actually true, people will notice and kick the can forward for more people to review, retweet, or squawk about. In the words of the great Howard Todd, it just works.\n\n**Wouldn’t people get tired of seeing things they don't like and just quit, concentrating the pool of toxicity?**\n\nAgain, this relies on there being a big enough user base to filter out anything actually dangerous, misleading, and wrong. Ideas and opinions that reach maximum exposure will only do so if there is actually merit and intelligence behind them, with the exception of tweets that reach certain thresholds in the retweet to squawk ratio and are promptly detected, reviewed, and removed. Don't like it? Then fight back! If what you believe in is truly worth it to you, you will have the strength to stand up for it. As Elon Musk says, twitter is a warzone and you better be ready to duke it out with anyone who disagrees with you. On top of that, there is a certain addictiveness associated with scrolling through twitter and hashing it out with people.\n\n**Isn't this just the reddit sort by controversy?**\n\nKind of? And boy do you guys love it. The biggest difference is follower count and unique users.  People with a lot of followers and people who are famous will be weighted higher in the algorithm for exposure. For example, 2 tweets that say the same thing and receive the same amount of retweets or squawks will be moved up the algorithm differently depending on the amount of followers, and whether the person is verified as authentic either manually or through the algorithm.\n\n**What prevents this from becoming the next  4chan?**\n\nThe reason why 4chan is a disgusting mess and twitter wouldn't given these changes is due to the level of anonymity. yes you can technically hide your identity on twitter  but there is really no point and the website is not catering to that market. people go on twitter and gain followers for a multitude of reasons, but primarily the purpose is either to build a following or better connect with an already well established following.  Famous people dont go to 4chan, they go to twitter. It's part of the brand. arguments that suggest that free speech platforms can't work ignore the fact that the biggest reason it doesn't currently work on platforms like 4chan is because these platforms escape the responsibility of personal accountability. people WILL think carefully about the things they say if the consequences of going 4chan troll risk jeopardizing their career. There is no evidence to suggest that unfettered free speech and personal accountability and social responsibility can't coexist on the same platform, and I challenge anyone who disagrees to fight me on that.\n\n**Won't people just refuse to pay the subscription fee and move off the platform?**\n\nIn twitter's current state, of course. That's likely why twitter never bothered to try anything like this in the past. It was simply more profitable for advertising to cater to one side.\n\nThings are different now. There are enough users to make a new system actually work, and demand for a product like this exists. if implemented  correctly, it could become more marketable and even more addictive. Remember now, the subscription does not need to be much. just 1 or 2 dollars a month, and tiers and features above that. you can get super creative with incentives to subscribe, for example cash rewards for reaching certain follower numbers and criteria.\n\nI admit, much of the profit potential here bets on my belief that the majority of people would rather engage in smart, intelligent debate rather than 4chan trolling. If this is true then that content will naturally float to the top. My evidence is  that 4chan is a dying community and podcasts like Joe horseworm DMT Rogan continue to gain millions and millions of views, and continue to grow larger by the day.\n\nI’ll maybe continue to add and answer questions if this post sees the light of day, but other than that my word wall is finished here. See ya.\n\nElon if you are reading this and I know you are not, I recognize that you have a megamind head and already know all this shit, especially since I literally came up with all this in a few hours while I was at work and you have been planning for the last couple weeks/months.

I keep going back to this every few months when I make retarded moves.\n\n \n\nIMO, trading options have similarities to playing poker and in order to be successful in the long run you need to be disciplined and refrain from making common mistakes. I’m going to list common mistakes and some tips here. Please suggest more. Hope we all lose less tendies!\n\n1. Refrain to trade low volume options . These contracts will have really wild bid/ask spread, or really low volume, which reduces your chance to make profit significantly. For example how can you win if you trade $ROPE 100c when the bid ask spread is $69/$96 per contract?\n2. Refrain to trade very low price options (e.g 1-10 cents) because your broker commissions will eat up a significant amount of the transactions. Think how much commissions you have to pay to buy 10000 contracts of 0.01 $ROPE 1000c which costs $10000 of premium.\n3. Refrain to buy near-dated far OTM options, because this is almost a sure way to burn your money. Even worse, even if you guess the direction right, you may still have a substantial loss. Think $PEI 500% OTM 2DTE. Btw $PEI is a great stock to own. Example: on 04/13 you bought SPY 496c 04/17 when SPY=280. On 04/14 SPY rises to 285. Guess how much you made on your call options?\n4. Know when to select OTM vs ITM options: in general: OTM is higher risk/higher return. Have some sense of OTM price movement - even when you guess the direction right, far OTM options won’t make you money because of low delta. ITM is more expensive. ATM is typically a safe choice if you just want to make a directional bet.\n5. Know theta-crush. Your options will lose time-value every day, so refrain from buying short-dated options unless you know what you're doing.\n6. Know the effects of IV (VIX for SPY) on options price. Sometimes even when you guess the direction rights, you may lose money because of VIX movements. Know how to hedge for VIX movement.\n7. Refrain from using market orders when possible: limit orders will give you the price you want.\n8. Understand the margin impact of different options strategies.\n9. Understand the impact of your broker commissions.\n10. Bank management: never YOLO your entire portfolio into one position, because if you lose, there’s 0% chance to make it back. Learn [http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/basic/bankroll-management/](http://www.thepokerbank.com/strategy/basic/bankroll-management/). If you want to get in a large (50K+) position, average in/out may be a good idea.\n11. Don't open too many positions unless you're a bot. It's hard to manage manually and easy to make mistakes.\n12. (Mostly) don't follow autist DDs that you can't explain.\n13. Learn the market hours!\n14. Options strategies can be complex to visualized. Use your broker's performance profile tool to understand the performance implications before making a trade.\n\n**Some risky options strategies that you should only do when you know what you’re doing**\n\n* Naked puts, i.e. short puts: very risky especially in a recession: when the underlying crashes you’ll lose lots of money\n* Synthetic shorts: i.e. long puts + sell calls, also very risky, only know when you’re 90% sure of the direction.\n* Naked calls, i.e. short calls: also pretty risky if the underlying moons.\n* …\n\n**Less risky options strategies:**\n\n1. Covered calls: very low risk. You hold shares, and sell OTM calls to cover them and collect the premium.\n2. Cash secured puts: sell puts but you have cash to cover it. This is good when you’re willing to buy the shares if it drops, otherwise you collect the premium.\n3. Diagonal: Simultaneously entering into a long and short position in two options of the same type (two call options or two put options) but with different strike prices and different expiration dates. Typically these structures are on a 1 x 1 ratio. This is less risky and can hedge you against IV as well. For example if you bearish on USO, buy a 4p 05/15 and sell a 3.5p 04/24, that way if USO moves upward on the week ending 04/24 you’ll collect the near-dated premium.\n4. Learn how to sell options. Every mistake you made as an option buyer is probably a chance for you to profit as an option-seller.\n\n**Practical tips**\n\n1. Use tools to scan top volume options. [https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders](https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders) . This can give you some confirmation.\n2. Use tools to scan unusual activity options. [https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity](https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity) Try to think why people are making that trade. Your broker also has tools to scan these.\n3. Take advantage of L2 flow data if your broker provides.\n4. Sometime when you can't make a long-term directional bet, it may be profitable to day-trade or swing-trade (hold your positions for 1-3 days).\n5. Know common ETFs:\n\n* SPY: everyone knows this. The most liquid options to trade.\n* IWM: tracks Russell 2000. Also pretty liquid. Trade this if you don't want expose to big techs.\n* Sector specific ETFs: XLE, XLF, XLC, etc. Also highly liquid.\n* Country specific ETFs: EWU, EWG, EWC, EWA, EWJ ... fairly liquid.\n* Gold: GLD\n* Silver: SLV\n* Oil: USO (make sure you really understand this; it doesn't track oil price)\n* Options of individual stocks: in general, the more liquid the underlying, the more liquid the options, e.g. AMZN, BA, FB, TSLA, ...\n\n**Tips to improve**\n\nLearn more about economics and business to improve your common sense.\n\nAdvanced topics: understand how MM works, gamma hedging, dark pool indicators, probably understand some TAs such as RSI.\n\nDay trade dynamics: power hours.\n\n**Things to debate**\n\n1. Should you use stop-loss orders or not?\n2. When to buy FDs and how much should you spend on FDs?\n3. What is the impact of the underlying delisted on put options? As example OILU closed on 03/29 [https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/MC3724/20200316/SUP\\_421079.PDF](https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/MC3724/20200316/SUP_421079.PDF)\n\n* On March 15, 2020 ProShares Capital Management LLC announced that it plans to close and liquidate ProShares UltraPro 3x Crude Oil ETF (ticker symbol: OILU) and ProShares UltraPro 3x Short Crude Oil ETF (ticker symbol: OILD). Each fund trades on NYSE Arca. The last day the funds will accept creation orders is March 27, 2020. Trading in each Fund will be suspended prior to market open on March 30, 2020. Proceeds of the liquidation are currently scheduled to be sent to shareholders on or about April 3, 2020 (the “Distribution Date”).\n* Shareholders may sell their shares of a Fund (subject to any applicable brokerage or transaction costs) until the market close on March 27, 2020. From March 30, 2020 through the Distribution Date, shares of the Funds will not be traded on NYSE Arca and there will not be a secondary market for the shares. During this period, each Fund will be in the process of liquidating its portfolio and will not be managed in accordance with its investment objective.\n* These strategies are intended to allow an Oil Fund to preserve a minimal portion of its value in the event of significant adverse movements in a Fund’s benchmark. There can be no guarantee that an Oil Fund will be able to implement such strategies or that such strategies will be successful. Each Oil Fund will incur additional, potentially substantial, costs as a result of such strategies which may cause or increase tracking error and would be expected to have a substantial adverse impact on performance. Use of such strategies would cause an Oil Fund to not perform consistent with its investment objective. Furthermore, in the event that an Oil Fund’s value decreases by 70% or more at any point from its prior day’s NAV, as determined by the Sponsor, the Sponsor, in its sole discretion, in order to maintain the integrity of the ongoing operation of the Fund or for other reasons, may cause such Fund to liquidate some or all of its positions and, in lieu of such positions, invest such assets in cash or money market instruments. The above actions may be taken without prior notification to shareholders and would be expected to cause an Oil Fund not to perform consistent with its investment objective. Under these circumstances, consistent with its general authority, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, cause an Oil Fund to be terminated and dissolved.  \n\n\nLike I said, not my post. don't give me anything.

Most of the upward bull swing was made within the first 45 minutes of the day though with some impressively large green candles. \n\nAs you can see we closed ABOVE and well ABOVE the red bear channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcsh3xt43ku81.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b345fa48e77df7e86869db0613be60f979aa6c\n\nSo yep you guessed it… SPY OFFICIALLY broke the bear channel started back on March 29th. BUT we have NOT made a new higher high until SPY  breaks that large black dotted like at 450. Once SPY breaks 450 I will officially call this a bull run. Until then we could be forming a wider bear channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iw2qdxb53ku81.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=471f6939e5131df16c424c56bd97408bf9d65fb1\n\nWhich looks something like this! \n\nThis much wider bear channel gives us a resistance as I mentioned at 450 and a new support at 432. Now the one issue here is that Netflix just got absolutely obliterated on its earnings again (down 26% as im writing this). With Netflix posting a massive hit like that I worry that the markets are going to over react and take a hit here to price in terrible earnings. We have Tesla earnings after hours tomorrow and that will be the true test of what is going to happen with the markets this earnings season in my opinion. However, it would be naive not to expect a retrace tomorrow with this Netflix hit as we see right now -0.44% currently. Definitely will be something to watch intraday tomorrow. 442.7 provided heavy support today so that is definitely a level we need to keep an eye on tomorrow. As long as spy holds that (bounced off it after hours) I believe we will see green tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf0coi063ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a97057111bcce4b3e507b4e6554e79d929a1510d\n\nSPY daily chart we are still in the bear channel as I mentioned until we see 450 tomorrow (if it comes). Right now the main take aways for the day was that the bulls managed to close Spy ABOVE the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema today after opening below all the EMAs. That is a VERY bullish finish today and will in my opinion set the tone for the rest of the week and next. The only bearish take away I have from today is that bulls were not able to close above the daily 100ema of 446.04. However, this close here gives us a easy spot to close above the daily 100ema tomorrow. The daily 8ema of 442.7 (at the time) provided support almost all day today and that is something I will look for to continue tomorrow with the 8ema closing at 442.91. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f6eeqj63ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8701d9b4131fb199290bfdf86b8d30be77cf6fd\n\nApple had a bullish day today also but actually failed to break its bear channel on the 15min chart. This channel has a resistance of 168 tomorrow and support of 160.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xsd4pu673ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d525b6936b700ef73774b51c580f140de41bea97\n\nDespite Apples green day it actually looks more bearish than SPY today. Apple failed to break its daily 8/ 50ema at 168.27 today. That is actually fairly bearish, however, bulls could argue Apple closed above the 100ema after trading below it for 3 days and now has an opportunity tomorrow to close above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100ema.

QQQ is roughly 19% of its highs still and to me offers the most upside potential. \n\nQQQ as you can see broke their bear channel today. QQQ also was able to close ABOVE its daily 8ema of 345.35 today which is the first time if almost two weeks. The daily 20 (348.85), 50 (351.93), 200 (357.18) and 100 (358.06) are all now well within the grasps of QQQ if you can close above it. You can also see QQQ managed to hold a crucial support of 338. I mentioned the possible head and shoulders formed that would shoot QQQ back to 375-380 in the next few weeks. If bears are in control tomorrow they will attempt to close back below the daily 8ema again and also break it back near that 338 support line. \n\nOverall we are entering earnings season and now is a risky time to be holding ANYTHING over night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3c8tjh983ku81.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b586e1e9ecc4c2b151dabed52e3560134610e10\n\nRealistically besides Tesla tomorrow and SNAP on Thursday there isn’t any truly market moving (not that SNAP is) earnings to write home about. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was quite the day for me as I was able to make about 2.5x my daily profit goal today.

Here are the results.\n\n* **Earnings per share:** $3.22 vs $2.26 expected\n* **Revenue:** $18.76 billion vs $17.80 billion expected\n\nEarly this month, Tesla reported [vehicle deliveries](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2022-vehicle-production-and-delivery-numbers.html) of 310,048 for the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Model 3 and Model Y vehicles comprised 95%, or 295,324, of deliveries in the period ending March 31, 2022.\n\nWednesday\'s earnings call comes amid news of CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/)\'s hostile takeover bid for [Twitter](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TWTR), the social media platform he has relied on to promote Tesla and his own public image for years.\n\nMusk no longer leads or speaks on every Tesla earnings call. But ahead of Wednesday\'s update, he said that he plans to be on the call, which starts at 5.30 p.m. ET.\n\nTesla recently opened two new factories outside of Berlin, Germany, and Austin, Texas, and the CEO appeared for both grand opening events.\n\nInvestments in these massive new facilities are part of Tesla\'s effort to localize production and lower the cost and improve the speed of distributing vehicles from factories to customers in major markets throughout Asia and Europe.\n\nAt the same time, Tesla has been facing semiconductor chip and other parts shortages, as well as inflationary pressures that are impacting the entire autos industry stemming from the pandemic, and exacerbated by Russia\'s brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn the last days of the first quarter, Tesla\'s vehicle assembly plant in China was forced to suspend production due to extreme Covid control measures in and around Shanghai. The company is now reportedly resuming some production there, and asking employees to [sleep at the factory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-18/tesla-shanghai-sets-out-hand-washing-sleeping-plans-for-workers).\n\nMeanwhile in the U.S., Tesla\'s labor and other business practices are under the microscope.\n\nA court filing on Monday [revealed](https://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=306105268&amp;amp;z=09519e74) that in addition to previously reported investigations by the SEC and DOJ, Tesla has been dealing with a previously undisclosed probe by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) which enforces civil rights laws against workplace discrimination.\n\nThe EEOC probe preceded a lawsuit by California\'s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, in which the state civil rights agency alleged that Tesla has ignored and enabled anti-Black harassment, discrimination and rampant racism at its Fremont factory. Tesla disputed the allegations and accused the DFEH of targeting the company to create a press spectacle.\n\nSome investors are interested in how Tesla plans to address these allegations, according to questions submitted to Tesla ahead of earnings calls [via Say Technologies](https://app.saytechnologies.com/tesla-2022-q1).\n\nBut more shareholders want to know about Tesla\'s progress on new products and scaling production in Germany and Texas.\n\nAmong other things, they are seeking updates on Tesla\'s ability to produce and use 4680 battery cells in its cars and energy storage products. They also want more details on a "futuristic" driverless robotaxi that Musk teased at an Austin [factory event recently](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/07/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-hosts-cyber-rodeo-party-to-open-austin-factory.html), and on the company\'s experimental driver assistance system, FSD Beta.'), ('Here for the short term $NFLX', 'Here for the short term $NFLXIs it a good time to buy some puts?

Inflation should come back down. Why? Or How? \n\nMoney is removed from circulation.\n\n1.) Recent swarm in real estate purchases at low rates is a safe house for cash. Some people park cash in gold some people park cash in houses. Russian oligarchs *cough*. With so many mortgages locked in at low rates and home prices at ATHs. It’s a double entendre: did inflation come first or did reckless spending come first?\n\n2.) bank rates are raised but slowly. Why?! Why is there a fear of recession if rates are raised too fast? Not everyone world wide has access to real estate or risk free bonds(3). If rates are raised too fast, the economy and world might go into full saving mode. Putting an end to spending.\n\n3.) Well, with the roll out of the series I savings bond, 8-9% interest locked in risk free is a steal for many Americans. This also outpaces the SPY. $10k per American locked up for 1-5 years.\n\n4.) Risk off already happened. With the hike in prices, many growth companies have come to a strong halt not only because of expenses but also people arnt willing to pay more for less now.\n\n5.) The dollar has bounced back stronger than ever. With the world in a dash for cash and countries failing the greenback will become really strong. Say hello to the 1:2 loonies\n\nThe next Fed meeting is in May 3-5\n\nMy guess is that rates will remain steady, no big hikes. Growth will stall but risk taking will come back onto the market. Savers are forced to make a decision. Either invest in bonds, the bigger stocks, or real estate. \n\nMe think risk free bonds and big blues will be the go to. But big blues will only be a place holder for many who are forced into a position outside of banks and fed notes. of course there’s always other things like inflation hedge digitals.\n\nStagflation is not something that the FEDs will fear because it’s something they can clearly step the breaks on when they want. suffer short term get the economy back long term. four day work weeks coming to your local office so everyone can continue to work at the same productivity. \n\nTLDR: fed say we stick to plan, market hits true bottom and you can clear out half your watch list.

It\'s down from like $650/share to $240/share in like 6 months. WHY? **Because tech is bullshit. It\'s the biggest fucking illusion in modern history.**\n\n**They are an industry built on mass surveillance, the only problem is that the surveillance they collect is worthless garbage**. Let me explain- Netflix steals all the data it can from you, including your contacts, your contact\'s contacts, what porn you like, what things you buy, what things you LOOK AT, your location as well as the places you travel to, etc etc.\n\nThis is the same as any other company such as google, meta, uber, lyft, door dash, EVERYTHING.\n\nSome of these companies, such as Uber, lose money YEAR AFTER YEAR. How is it possible that they keep going up in value even when competitors enter the market? **IT IS BECAUSE OF DATA COLLECTION.** Uber promises it\'s investors that its huge pile of data (again, not just the data you think it needs from you, data about EVERYTHING they can take from you) is valuable. They say, "in the near future we will be able to create value with this data".\n\nThat\'s a lie. Why? Because information without context is useless, even if you have an infinite amount of it. Want proof? **You have access to the internet which offers nearly infinite information, and yet you\'re still a useless ritard.** Companies are no different. Ok so Uber knows I took a shit at 2PM today because my phone\'s altitude lowered by 3 feet and was held at a 45 degree angle for 90 minutes. COOL.\n\nJust look at Netflix. Look at the pure, hideously stupid garbage they produce. There is literally NOTHING to watch on that shit platform (same as all the others), and they only reason they\'re alive is because they\'re living on the power of true artists of Hollywood\'s past artists, who made things that came from the soul, heart and mind, not from algorithms crawling tiktocks.\n\nNerds took over Hollywood and nerds will always be fucking nerds. They are NERDS because they MISS THE POINT. They love to go, "hurr durr I\'m so smart with my 150 IQ and I will make a lot of money in the future, so why doesn\'t the blonde cheerleader prefer me over the handsome popular jock??" That\'s how nerds think, and now they run all of tech.\n\nSo the Netflix nerds go, "OMG LOOK AT ALL THESE PEOPLE CLICKING ON LOGAN PAUL VIDEOS, LET\'S PUT HIM IN A HORROR FILM" The result? You get to watch a fucking moron who can\'t act, whose existence online is purely to distract 8 year olds from doing their homework, STARRING IN A FUCKING MOVIE. No one wants to see Logan Paul in a movie, which is why it bombed and just adds to the collective failure of all these tech streaming services.\n\nFurthermore, they go, "oh people are click on trans stories, let\'s make a movie about a Japanese pregnant man and his wife" Yeah ok, people are clicking on these stories because they are click baitey articles, not because people actually want to watch dramas about pregnant men. Do you understand what I\'m saying? These netflix tech nerd ritards **HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THEIR "DATA" IS MEANINGLESS YET THEY PERSIST IN CREATING SHOWS BASED OFF THIS DATA AND THUS MAKE SHOWS ABOUT PREGNANT MEN**\n\nI have nothing against LGBTQAI+ stuff, but people like to watch movies that give them a PLEASANT experience (even if the film is about something sad). They don\'t want to see CNN or Fox news make a fucking movie. The problem is that these tech companies **have no way of obtaining the valuable data, the data of what people REALLY want**. They nerds think they can piece together my wants and needs based on what instagram thots I jack off too... NOPE, people are more complex than that and Netflix is finding that out in a very hard way.\n\nThey are not artists, they are not even traditional Hollywood business men who knew how to at least exploit artists for good movies once in a while. They are dumbass silicon valley nerds who thought they could enter the arena of the soul and creativity and they are getting BTFO\n\nTo summarize, buy Tesla because they are the only tech company collecting valuable data. They collect data based on driving and use it build self driving and to upgrade Tesla\'s camera systems.'), ('🌈🐻spy put we are going down baby still holding', '🌈🐻spy put we are going down baby still holding')], '2022-04-23': [('Google, the oversold cash cow 🐄 that will blow past earnings...mooo', "Google, the oversold cash cow 🐄 that will blow past earnings...moooGoogle is a cash cow.  \n\nIt has complete control of the market in search that it will not lose.\n\nIt has dominance or little competition in so many markets: Android OS, Web browsing (Chrome), Video streaming (YouTube), Google Maps, Smart Home technology.\n\nIt has Google Cloud whose growth has accelerated faster than AWS and MSFT Allure.\n\nIt has more information about you, than you can even remember.\n\nGoogle has so much reliance on it's monopolistic software that it can do so much with the extra money it generates.  \n\nIt is not at the risk of not being at the technology forefront by focusing on hardware.\n\nIt has Business Workspace for enterprise.\n\nGoogle is everywhere.\n\nIt has so many integrated revenue streams, easy control of pricing over those revenue streams and can target users with how much information it has.\n\n\n\n\nGoogle consistently beats earnings.\n\nIt consistently maintains enormous margins.\n\nIt consistently increases revenue and FCF, tripling in 3 yrs since 2018.\n\nGoogle only has 150k employees (compare to Amazon 1.6 million).\n\nIt is growing, safe, essentially has monopolies, low operating costs that are easily controllable and control of revenue.

Technical-wise we\'re kinda in no-man\'s land as of Friday\'s close, with both indices hovering a bit above their March lows. I suspect we continue down and re-test those, but then the real questions get asked: *is this just a re-test and we bounce? Or do valuations reset further and we have more pain to go?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[IWM 1y](https://preview.redd.it/ps8htr7vnhv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02b6750aad3871e35c738f80415ebe2ee0d50071)\n\n[IWM 3y](https://preview.redd.it/okjw9u7vnhv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9115e51d8b7a883e6cc8c3ca397ef249d1b1c61)\n\n* Small caps were range-bound for a large part of 2021, and in November broke out. Ultimately this breakout failed, and in retrospect (IMO) really portended the downturn that spread to the rest of the market in January 2022.\n* Small caps have traded down close to %20 from their highs, and have chopped sideways in a lower range as the rest of the market has followed it down. IMO, no rally is legitimate unless we see small caps follow through, and I think we need to get back above the 212 mark in IWM to have any confidence in a rally. If we break below 190, watch for 170 (pre-covid high) as the next level of support.\n\n[RUA 1y](https://preview.redd.it/pv5s7j5znhv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de17c83045144bde96b59ca36576a5c69d96a47)\n\n* For those that are unaware, the RUA is the Russell 3000, essentially (but just not quite) the entire US stock market. This is just one way to get a broad view of how everything is performing.\n* Like the SPY and QQQ, this looks to be in no-man\'s land as well, and I suspect we\'ll revisit that bottom line in the near-term.\n\n# Sectors\n\n[Sector Performance Comparison, 6m](https://preview.redd.it/jqaj0q81ohv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a2b20cb7d88a6b27fb125f4b19d04b488c6368c)\n\n* This is a pretty busy, but handy chart I look at to give me an idea of relative performance across many market sectors. It\'s been useful the last few years as we\'ve had a ton of rotation between different areas of the market, and this can help me spot that and trade momentum accordingly.\n* Very recently defensives like health care and consumer stables have been outperforming relative to the broader market, though they gave a bit back this week.\n* The drawdown this week was definitely market-wide, which is somewhat worrying.\n* Energy has still been outperforming, which makes sense given the inflation narrative and what\'s going on in the world.\n* Curiously, Utilities (XLU) have been outperforming. This is curious because normally in a rising rates environment utilities would underperform.\n\nI\'m not going to go through all of these individually, but we\'ll take a look at a few which are interesting given present market conditions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ DJU vs US10y, \\~10y ](https://preview.redd.it/wm4c20y5ohv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=330dd6db7373f1a62a41dc3f87cbddad0256df03)\n\n* This is showing the Dow Jones Utilities index compared with the US10y yield, since \\~2012. I\'ve tried to mark out a particular correlation: when yields go up, generally utilities underperform, as they are yield-sensitive. There\'s been a divergence recently as utilities have been bid up while yields are rising. We should expect this divergence to break down, it may have just started last week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ DJTA vs DJIA, 1y ](https://preview.redd.it/4p0hy3kaohv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=534f22073afa49d43003b8d2a3fb314a739a323a)\n\n* Here we\'re taking a look at the lately-talked-about Dow Theory, which suggests that if one of the Dow Jones Industrials (why is this ticker banned?) or Down Jones Transports advances above a previous important high/level, *and the other follows suit*, then the market is most likely in an upward trend.We saw the transports, DJTA, break out during that rally in the second half of March, but the industrials chopped sideways during the same time, not confirming the upward trend and providing some signal that the March rally was most likely a bear market rally and sell-the-rip moment. Transports have since given it all back and traded in-line with the industrials.\n\nMoving on...\n\n# Bonds, Dollar, Sentiment\n\n[ HYG, 5y ](https://preview.redd.it/l7cnpqqcohv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d21269b14ea149344199da99cf4af8951a60afaf)\n\n[ LQD, All Time ](https://preview.redd.it/cvy0pqqcohv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=544c9210835d1dd7f622d8d7c249b632ad1b1f23)\n\n* Aside from government treasuries, it\'s worth looking at what\'s going on with corporate credit, bonds sold by US corporations. HYG tracks US high-yield (bad) credit, LQD tracks US "investment-grade" (good) credit - companies like JPM, AAPL, etc.Both of these have been rolling over as yields rise (the yields on these bonds are all rising too), and are right around some pretty serious support levels. Personally, I think we start to stabilize or get a pullback in yields near-term, with 3% likely a good top level for the US10y. Or we could just blow through that and see even more carnage in bond markets, which has been historical.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ DXY, 5y ](https://preview.redd.it/meb8j4nfohv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=073aae4597dea62c552eb77f704c89bde7866950)\n\n* The DXY is a measure of the US dollar against a "basket" of other currencies, but mostly the Euro (50-something % of this index). Dollar outperformance is bad for the US and a lot of US companies: while it gives us more purchasing power abroad, it *raises the cost for foreign purchasers to buy from us*, which hurts revenues. The DXY above $100 is bad news for US stocks, and right now it looks like it\'s going to try for that recent 5y-high at 102.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ AAII Sentiment](https://preview.redd.it/5pemxobiohv81.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db6e7eaee1bf733973e0f5797a2928551126828)\n\n \n\n[ CCN Money Fear and Greed Index](https://preview.redd.it/crjbxnbiohv81.png?width=1073&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8370e7a2e2b21cc2dbe235805a29311045dfb52d)\n\n \n\n[ NYSE New Lows vs New Highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fs6ctqbiohv81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2264d6e3b398d8a82f856e1717c741ed6a987afe)\n\n* Sentiment is still broadly bearish, but I believe (as others) that we haven\'t yet hit max capitulation - we still need that final panic selling moment and that\'s when you can buy. I\'m not actually sure we\'ll get that, or know it in the moment, but I\'d be inclined to be bearish for the time being.\n* NYSE new lows vs new highs really broke down last week.

DXY has also gone to  $100, just as we predicted as it\'s a basic Wyckoff accumulation pattern of 20yrs. The only thing that remains is when the FED will inject QE+ and debase their currency again.

Cash is Haven\n\nYah, i know most people wont agree with this thought. But my readers know how well it\'s going to hold up to cash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Why is cash important?](https://preview.redd.it/ife12l9ksfv81.png?width=927&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f011b0463e2272ecbf114522070bf903609a4c96)\n\nDo you know why I said so ? Because I was waiting for an option other than " TINA " Its bonds. That\'s why I told you all to HODL cash. Now some might argue well, how are we going to fight inflation. Well, you can\'t this year, but surely in 10yr you can. You just have to look at Real Bond yields chart. They are positive. Meaning investors are keeping an eye on that. And i can sure as hell tell you Bank of America is buying coz, they have set their targets 2.35% at 10yr note. \n\nSo buy bonds and you get a half-yearly payment on it. And when that payment arrives in lets say Q4 or the 2023 recession. Buy your favorite money-making stocks at a cheaper price or Gold (coz Gold too, falls in Recession). It\'s that simple strategy. And also pray that bonds don\'t get obliterated in this coming recession like a 4sigma bubble collapse. I\'m betting things will take turns. First bonds then the housing market, later on putting pressure on stocks, and the word which i cannot speak here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the key would be to buy which bonds and at what time? \n\nSo i would recommend a 2yr / 5yr for flipping and 10yr bond as an investment. Time would be May June period. So time it with your T.A. on bonds using Daily and weekly TF. I have given you the month. :) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I think I have given you a rough idea of what we have predicted so far. But as time progresses things could turn, but so far it\'s all going according to our plan.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\'s been the longest recap in the history of the WSB i suppose. But now lets move on from this and take a look at what has happened these past weeks and how are we gonna trade in May-June intelligently so that we don\'t get lost in the volatility jungle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKey events that have happened and some that are coming up :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1. Earnings Season :**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na) Bank Earnings :\n\n[JP Morgan](https://preview.redd.it/t5id8dzj2hv81.jpg?width=5184&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a15cd7847916758ac70a594ec4d639c640cf2ae)\n\nJP Morgan\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo JP Morgan kicked off with earnings last week. I must say something seems fishy there with Nickel Trading and their losses in Russia. Just like any other conspiracy theorist, i cannot help but wonder that the books are being cooked there. Regardless, though, i love Jamie Dimon, and if you are reading this, sir, you did a great job this decade. I wish you "Happy Retirement" early on. Wall Street will miss you when you leave office this year.\n\nHighlights of earnings :\n\n\\-&gt; People have more cash in q1 than q4. I bet some of the people took profits\n\n\\-&gt; There was a rise in debt by people. And combined credit + plus debt rose 21% compared to last year.\n\n\\-&gt; Earnings were bad for JPM. Hence EPS low. They suffered some losses in Russia and also the transactional revenue has declined. But they offered share buybacks from May 1 which is bullish. Overall, if you are investing in banks, it\'s complicated. But hey, some institutions think JPM is trading at a discount of $20-30, so there\'s that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoldman &amp; Morgan stanley\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe same was the story with these two giants. Making money. Their traders made a killing in q1. but trading revenue isn\'t that high compared to last yr. And consumers are still spending like no tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[BOA](https://preview.redd.it/2tniw6io2hv81.jpg?width=3190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b8d2fb0b9430818726a44ce98cedc63e1556657)\n\nBank of America\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-&gt; Defaults are lower than 2019 levels..\n\n\\-&gt; Mortgage rate up\n\n\\-&gt; Q1 opened more credit cards. And they are spending more.\n\n\\-&gt; Relaxation by China later on in Q2 and Russia situation by Victory Day ( They believe it. Not me )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo overall i would say, we kinda expected this from bank earnings. They didn\'t beat our expectations by huge numbers and they all took a hit from Russia. Going into Q4 we would see rates, yields up and a steepening curve. So banks should do well theoretically. Well, they aren\'t for now. But that could soon change once we get more clarity from the FED. Otherwise we are gonna get a financial crisis on top of a recession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) Tech Earnings :\n\n[Next week is so important guys.

They carry the entire S&amp;P500 on their backs. Lets see how they perform next week. Finger crossed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut lets talk about this hilarious Dotcom-style chart from a company called Netflix. What a script it has written. I feel sorry for Bill Ackman that i really wanna invest in it. Kidding XD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Netflix : My Buy entries \\( White Lines \\) ](https://preview.redd.it/h78wzt6xkgv81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c6ce8afdf6a662d445c63455ada673ca1b0de6c)\n\nLets analyze what happened with it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Advertizing business is getting hit by Apple. It happened in January too with NFLX, FB ,SNAP. And soon Google will follow Apple\'s path.\n\n2) Inflation man. Its killing the future earnings of growth stocks combined with increased competition from HBO Max, Disney and Apple TV, which are seriously more good than netflix content.\n\n3) Took hit from Russia, Ukraine and Elon Woke tweets. Hence, Lost subscribers.  \n\n4) Its strategy of pricing power by doubling amounts and flip flopping on password sharing didn\'t work out as they hoped.  ( remember those tweets from before )\n\nOverall, its a consumer discretionary growth stocks and not worthy to be named together with FAANG. I\'ll go with MANGA from here now ( MSFN , AAPL , NVIDIA , GOOGL , AMZN ) Meta and Netflix need a break.\n\nNote : Even though NFLX got steam rolled from every part you could think of. But it\'s soon going to have a pullback from Stranger Things 4 which no one is talking about. So trade well, my friends, but remember, don\'t get attached. It will fall to $120-130 later on is what i believe. ( -83% crash. Love that number ) Could possibly go to $60-80 in recession. Would be a good buy then for next 10yrs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also wanted to talk about Twitter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Twitter Bullish Chart if Elon Buys the Company](https://preview.redd.it/jil81qwgugv81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49ef4cbe3b1bed4d618a7ccb142ba5fc8f9b760f)\n\nJust by looking at charts from back to December 2013, you can probably see that the company hasn\'t done anything innovating. Maybe that\'s what you get when you run a company on Blood money ( The person who created the platform is out )\n\nSo, as we all know Elon wants to buy the company because he wants to bring free speech to one of the biggest networking platforms of our generations. He could have built his own social networking media company like Trump did. But he understands the power of the networking effect. Hence he pitched his offer of $54.20 ( i would look it as "May 4" 420 means : crazy times at FOMC ) and freed up some cash.\n\nSo the board of directors can either take it or leave it. But the chart says to me that they don\'t want to give up a financial weapon and promote free speech. Hence they are taking the poison pill approach against Elon\'s hostile takeover. \n\nSo Elon comes up with an argument and says every board has a fiduciary duty towards its share holders. And it should take steps to benefit the company. So the board decided lets just calm the environment themselves and gave up a holiday to employees who were worried of getting fired by Elon Musk. That just speaks to me, of the direction in which the company is headed.\n\nImo, this board either has a magical plan to turn the ship around or they are just too dumb to recognize the potential of this company. \n\nOnly time will tell what\'s going to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2.  May 3-4 :   Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC )** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPowell, Brainard, Daly ( President of San Fransico ) , Summers ( Former FED Secretary of the Treasury 1999-2001 ), Bullard ( President of Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ) \n\nThese 5 guys have eaten the head out of me. Why in the world do we have to keep watching them as they speak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[FED buy sell indicator](https://preview.redd.it/8pcg4sia7hv81.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e69d1f8b1562f68155414c7e0f2b9c81bf33a52c)\n\nEspecially Powell guys. I am beginning to think that the FED has lost all credibility. They are being dishonest and rigging the market. Look at Sarah Eisen at FED. She basically asked Powell everything before the IMF presentation and took a short position. She put Powell on the spot by asking tough questions like "Do you want the market to go lower" and about "Rate hikes".\n\nTo which Powell replied "Ahhhhhhhhh" for the first and the second one "50bps is on the table"\n\nMarkets crashed immediately that day and the day later when reports emerged of 50bps being priced for May - June - July. Just wow.\n\nWe went from "Inflation is transitory" , "25bps gradual hikes in March 16 FOMC" to consecutive "50bps" with faster tightening cycles. And also removing balance sheet accomodation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets look now at FOMC to see if they actually can live up to their word and hike 50bps. If they did well, its pretty much priced in and we don\'t have to care much about the first 100bps, but if they went with 25bps. Markets should go up.\n\nAlso, the FED fund future is now targeting 3.25% for EOY. Lets see how it all unravels. Personally i would watch Overnight repo and Spreads even though last time like in 2018 case wont happen. Because now the FED has a facility watching for unusual rates movements. \n\nAlso do look out for the data in USA GDP. 2 quarters of -ve GDP is recession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. May 6 : Jobs report**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike it or not, the jobs market is overheated. A wage price spiral started to happen in January report, but not so much now. Maybe this report of may could show us that again. \n\nFor now, I dont think Job\'s numbers matter much now. More, of the jobs added to the current est. only gives FED more initiative to hike rates as they like or talk like 75bps or even 100bps.\n\nBut here\'s an interesting chart that I would like to share that literally no one is talking about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Recession : Gray U reverse, Orange : Wage growth yoy, Red : CPI yoy, White : FED funds rate](https://preview.redd.it/z7m4cijfqhv81.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c56f76cb6113d8427c3d502af9344f1a46b40aa)\n\nI would like to point out two, but maybe you guys can find three interesting things in the chart :\n\n1) If inflation &gt; or near the proximity of wage, then the FED hands are forced to increase the FED funds rates and cause recession.\n\n2) During the tightening cycle, wages tend to decrease downwards later on. This would mean that companies would come under some kind of pressure during this phase of the cycle.\n\n3) Is your H.W. XD\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4. May 9 : Victory Day**\n\nSo why is this day so important. Well, top professionals say like 1000 crazy but drunk people like me on  Wallstreet think that the stock market hasn\'t seen quite huge a selloff as it should. Maybe the reason behind it is the fact "Buy at the sound of cannon and sell at the noise of trumpets rally" is going on, and its creating an opposite effect to FED put theory ( I am sure you must know about Greenspan, Bernanke, and now Powell put. I dont know how Janet Yellen missed the train. Comments down below XD)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis theory is quite simple. You buy at peak fear and you sell at peak greed. Kinda like, "Bad news is good news and good news is bad news". I hope you all are getting my point. \n\nYou can also check historical returns, i am sure that would back my theory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\'s the last time when similar situation happened. And people, i apologize beforehand if this chart brings back haunting memories from the past or you have situations related to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Afghanistan War : Invasion October 2001 : Buy and sell later on b\\/w 56-90 days.](https://preview.redd.it/xf3v5x9awhv81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f36623854466294ef5be84639a47ba3721b4b16)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This is my current projection.

Well, allow me to explain :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNowadays we all know the CPI will come higher. \n\nSo 3-4 days before the CPI, the market starts selling off. But when CPI exp. comes out lower, then the market starts to go up. \n\nBut when CPI gets released there are always some few things that bother everybody and make a issue out of. So the market decides to sell regardless. Buy the rumor good CPI and sell the news CPI and then go up a few days later. \n\nIf the horrible CPI comes out then go much lower than we started that up rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Oil &amp; Gas prices moving up](https://preview.redd.it/x0bw974s7iv81.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ffe285c46087641a5ac0e9f3c6de2072d140642)\n\nThere are few metrics that are deciding whether it\'s a good or bad CPI report\n\na) Core PCE inflation : Well, this is the inflation that FED targets cause its from the demand side. Its the CPI inflation minus the food and energy. We need to see it decrease month over month so that we can see the inflexion point in the curve when supply-driven inflation comes down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nb) The Headline Inflation : This is the headline, number inflation which comes out to scare off the people. This number constitutes the food and energy part, which recently has been called "Putin Price Hike" in America.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote : The inflation you\'re seeing is not only from Putin but also from the excess money printing and helicopter money distributed after the pandemic. The value of the dollar has gone down significantly, and it takes about 2yrs to see the full effect of monetary policy, which you\'re seeing it now. \n\nSo the same case could be made for this tightening cycle, if it actually went through, would let us see the bottom of all bottoms in late 2023-2024. But no doubt you can see some strong reaction rallies in the bear market too. I hope that makes sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Closing thoughts :** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell now i wanted to talk about how Nasdaq, SP500 , Russell 2000 and Dow Jones might witness a price action which would take a route using my fundamental analysis with technical analysis. \n\nBut sorry guys im busy and have to go somewhere. You guys can check out my twitter link in the profile section. I will definitely post it before the market opens on Monday or i might edit this post and stick the analysis here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut still i might give you hint. \n\nCase 1 :\n\nAs we all know April doesnt look so good so far. But im expecting a comeback rally in the last weeks of April provided if the tech earnings are good enough that it impresses the investors. Once we go up then sell in may gets activated because you cant get past the extreme risk off weeks till CPI at May 11. But hopefully mom core pce comes down and then we kickstart the another bear market up rally again till last few weeks of may.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor the other thing that could happen is\n\nCase 2 :\n\nThe tech earnings doesnt impresses investors. We go down. More people start buying FED puts for FOMC and it piles so much that we go down horribly before FOMC. Powell then comes out in interview and calms everything down. And hopefully we go up again and get slightly pulled off by CPI but then CPI comes good all and we kickstart the up rally again to last few weeks of may and sell again before FOMC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.s : I didnt felt like writing these past days.

The bearish volume just kept flowing in and never stopped. With an impressive total range today of $14.66 which hit 153% of the average true range of $9.56.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nf8vfss13kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=790c5abb2c522b791f8596c4f0c884a5113808d1\n\nWe are in such an impressive bear channel right now and such a violent bear channel that if it breaks 410 Monday we very well could see below 400 by Wednesday before FOMC. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qw8bgle23kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1024f388939b9eacc977f556151dffe291f1a07\n\nOn the daily we are at an impressive point to say the least. We failed to reach the low of February 24th by about $0.60. the low of 410.64 is the most recent low. With us hitting 411.21 intraday one COULD call 411 a double bottom potential. \n\nI am still working on a theory that we are in a sideways (blue) channel from 415 to 458 with a few outliers here and there. So if SPY is able to within one or two more candles return to and hold above 415 it think my theory holds true. \n\nHowever I am also working that theory of the red bear channel which gives us a low of 400 by EOW (May 6th) or if we are within the orange bear channel we could see 394 within the next two weeks if we continue a steady decline. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9p9zk1x23kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=259aed3e45e607bebb028bfd3875283ff6d8fc35\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10vsaod33kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49079a5190515d39d1ad9aff7ac3df3b5eef3857\n\nI shared this weekly chart last week which show how we very well could be headed for a true bear market and could see the weekly chart touch the 200 ema at 360 for the first time since the Covid crash, and before that was the 2018 crash. 405.88 is currently the weekly 100ema and will be interesting to see if SPY can hold above that next week or not. If spy was to lose that next week I think we all but would guaranteed a visit to the 200 ema of the next few months. \n\nOn the current trajectory we could see the 200ema at 360 by middle of July. \n\nAs you can see we have a fuck ton of bearish momentum ahead and formed this week. It will be VERY important for bulls to not let this drop below 405 this week and definitely not let it stay below 405 this week. \n\nMy personal take is that we are not going to break 400 YET. I think we are going to see 400-405 Monday or Tuesday (about a 60-70% chance) and then Wednesday when FOMC happens JPOW is going to use his fancy works and nimble tools to rally the market like last time. As long as JPOW doesn’t throw a 100bps hike out there (whether we need it or not) the market should rally. The recent narrative is that inflation has peaked so realistically we should hear JPOW be singing that tune this week. \n\nHowever, IF like January JPOW gets up there and acts scared or says some off the wall stuff we are going to see 380-390 EOW without a doubt. There is a pretty good case to argue Monday we will see some sort of relief rally. A -4% drop on realistically a nothing burger is going to have some sort of relief. I would suspect us to revisit 415-420 on Monday. That doesn’t mean Tuesday may not drill us to 400-410 though. Current downward trend/ extreme bear channel resistance line for Monday is at 420. If bulls can rally the troops and break that we may see a bigger relief rally headed into Wednesday FOMC. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oj1tmjx33kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f767098018fb33df40b2cda293666dd4e28b36\n\nI had mentioned earlier this month that we had some consolidation periods that were followed by rallys. We do appear to be making another one of those periods right now if you look at the blue circles followed by the blue arrows. Each of those hit 450-460 range. If this one drops slightly lower around 400 it would be safe to say we could rally to 440-450 range. \n\nThe daily RSI is also starting to become very oversold finally hitting 35. This RSI is the same exact RSI that SPY rallied from in February and March. I will be very curious to see what FOMC and next week brings. I am going long here though at these levels well slowly entering long which I will touch on in my positions and the end of this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/asxdbrf43kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a70689dba051dc9f2bacac5b46173b324a76ada2\n\nApple had quite the red day today, of course not the same 5% green it had the day before, but after that earnings beat followed by not so great guidance it saw a -3.66% red day. \n\nApple finished back under its daily 200ema. I had mentioned that breaking back under the 200ema is not a good sign for apple. Apple has not had two candles in a row below the 200 ema since the Covid crash. Another candle Monday below the 8ema would be the first time in 2 years. \n\nApple also had a great upper channel resistance rejection this morning at 166.\n\nIf apple continues this trajectory downward we could see 145 range by middle to end of May. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0w1f25153kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a52e5bb95077c6d1e96c7af1afb8eb14c874e837\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfpohti53kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a11653e6d214f8d0f212855bab3c1643a4667aa\n\nOn the weekly chart Apple has not broke its 50ema currently at 154.57 since covid crash. Currently Apple bounced off that 50ema this week and on the current trajectory is about to see it broken this week if it doesn’t see some serious upside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9t8fx163kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96fa025c14b2846bb031ec97f0cc81bd1521f296\n\nQQQ is on an impressive downward trajectory and is the first of Apple, SPY and QQQ to break its low from February. It will be interesting to see if QQQ will bounce this week or not. Its pretty safe to assume that until QQQ bounces SPY most likely will not bounce either. \n\nI had mentioned that 310-315 was a key level to watch for QQQ and we hit there today. \n\nI will be watching to see if QQQ will break upwards towards 318, 322 and 328 resistance or if its gonna continue this trajectory and see 300 by the end of week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4navxm63kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b487587b68af408ed9c6a8ab1f31bb61ba0c354\n\nQQQ weekly charts actually on an impressively aggressive downward trend right now. It also unlike the February and March it closes a almost full candle below the weekly 100ema of 324.81. As you can imagine the last time that happened was the covid crash. \n\nThere currently is a fairly good argument we COULD see the weekly 200ema at 276 before the end of the month of May. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7g7s0773kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c75164fc17b18776781577187d92b8e5119b23ff\n\nThe VIX is going to be something to watch over the next week and where it opens Monday. If you remember I said a week or 2 ago that until we get something to spook the markets and the VIX can get back near 35-40 SPY had no chance of seeing 400. Well I stand by the fact that we really have had nothing to spook the market, it just conveniently just all of a sudden remembered that inflations is bad and covid/ supply chains are bad. Earnings this week arguably was the catalyst the market needed to spike the vix and see these levels again. \n\nLooking at the VIX daily chart our happy spot is 28 to 33.5. I will be watching for those key levels next week as we head into FOMC. With the added “fear” of FOMC on Wednesday we may see the VIX hit that key 40 level. \n\nI do believe if the VIX keeps rising we very well could see 400 Monday or Tuesday. However, I think a lot of that fear of the market and fear of the inflation unknowns with FOMC will dissipate on Wednesday and by Friday we would see the VIX unwind back down to or below 30. \n\nLooking back at February the VIX range at heights was 28.5 to 32.5 with a two big spikes to 39 and 36. In March the heights had us at 28 to 34.3 with a few spikes up to 36 and 37. So its safe to say while we may see a quick spike to or above 35 it would be pretty safe to assume that it would be short lived and be the next day or at least two days later their would be a dip in the vix and relief rally in spy. \n\nLooking at this more I do for see how we could hold around this level Monday and Tuesday. See a massive spike Wednesday only to see FOMC bring the vix down and start the next short term bull run. Unless the FOMC can reveal something terrible that is going to keep the VIX held and based here above 32 and even close to 40 there really isn’t in my opinion a big enough catalyst to see sub 400. \n\nDoing a quick look back since the Covid Crash anytime the VIX has spike intraday over 35 and especially anytime it has hit 37-40 it has within a week feel back down and fallen hard. This week if I happen to catch a day where VIX spikes to 37 to 40 I will hit up some 14dte OTM calls banking on that massive relief rally. \n\n10% challenge weekly wrap up-\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 20%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 3 dte 40%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 15%\n\n4/29/2022 put 0dte 40%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 3 dte 1%\n\n4/29/2022 Call 0dte -20%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 3dte 27%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 40%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte -50%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 5%\n\n4/29/2022 put 3dte 15%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 20%\n\n4/29/2022 Put (apple) 7dte 9%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 12%\n\nI made 54 total trades this week (25 calls and 29 puts)\n\nWin rate- 74% \n\nPut win rate-72.4% \n\nCall win rate- 72% win rate \n\nMy biggest loss came from a bad bounce on a 0dte put on Monday (still haunts me because it bounce hard and then would have been green).

I am pretty content with the overall 74% win rate and for the last two months that has been my average now. I would like to see 80% this week. However, one thing I want to take into account is trades where I exited at less then 10% of a loss. While yes that is a loss and not a win that is me manually exiting a trade because I recognize I entered a bad time, caught a bad bounce, momentum faded, etc. \n\nThere were 6 total losses for less than 10% loss. \n\nSo 40 wins plus 6 calculated/ mitigated losses= 46 or a win rate of 85.2% \n\nThat is something I would like to keep track of over the weeks to. I preach in my server that mitigating losses so that they are manageable to recover from is half the battle. Had Monday and Tuesday I better mitigated losses I would not have had had as big of a hole to get out of end of week. When the momentum dies we need to exit. \n\nWe can ALWAYS re-enter a trade and that’s what I have done this week a lot when momentum. Get in get 10-20%. Exit. Wait for the second push and re-enter.

So I am back on the hyperwheel right now. As I mentioned I think we are at a near bottom and I have pretty strong faith we will see at or above 415 by EOW again when my puts expire. \n\nLastnight I also mentioned I was going to enter some 60dte calls (30 delta) once we hit a bottom as an upside hedge. I did that today. I started at 420 and I plan every $5 we drop to dollar cost average by one contract. I will probably also do that on the way up until we high 425 maybe 430 and then I will let them ride till 440 most likely. At that time I will need to calculate upside vs downside potential to find a good time to take profits. I was very tempted to DCA at 411 today but if we truly hit 410 next week that opportunity will still be there. I am not that worried yet as my current breakeven is 418. Had I averaged down my break even would be closer to 416.3 though. This is a hedge not a full position so I didn’t and opted for the shorter term 432c way OTM calls. \n\nI also at 410 today decided to get some 7dte lotto calls for EOW.

This is the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Market.  These are loans on commercial buildings that have been securitized, bundled, and sold to investors.  The following is an explanation of the CMBS issues I wrote for another DD over six months ago:\n\n*The CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) Bomb*\n\n*This one is a bit different from the mess we had in 2008 with MBS (mortgage backed securities) because it\'s a different market with different rules, and it\'s a smaller total market than MBS.*\n\n*That said, the problems here might actually be worse. There is a company called Ladder Capital, formed out of the remnants of the Bear Stearns bond department, that has struck an unusual deal with Dollar Store, and they have a LOT of properties that are very, very much coasting on made up mortgages. I could easily write like three pages on this one partnership alone, but I\'ll just summarize instead and say these people learned absolutely nothing from 2008 except that it was a profitable scam that carried no jail time.*\n\n*To understand just how bad the CMBS mess is, you need to understand how CMBS\' work. At first glance, they\'re similar to regular MBS, it\'s a bundle of tens or hundreds of mortgages for commercial properties, they\'re divided into tranches (usually six) and the lowest tranches pay out the highest yields but also fail first. And now things get a little complex, so I\'m going to simplify like crazy here, but this is the most important part to understand why this is all going to blow up.*\n\n*A commercial building is an income generating property, it\'s market value is derived from how much income it generates. The bank lending you the money will want you to put up some amount of collateral for the loan. If rents go up, the amount of collateral you have to post goes down. If rent goes down, the amount of collateral you have to post goes UP. Now the weird thing about CMBS loans is that if only half your building is rented, you can just pay half your mortgage and whatever you owe for the other half of the building just gets added to the end of the loan. Now, say you can\'t rent out the empty half of your building, and you want to renegotiate the terms of your loan rather than just keep adding debt to the back of your loan. Well, this is where the CMBS comes into play, because all those different tranches? The investors behind them have different incentives, the guys at the lowest tranches don\'t want you to modify the loan, because that means losses, and they take those losses first, while the guys in the highest tranche want to modify the loan because it generates more income for them and they\'re not eating any losses. Unfortunately for you, in most CMBS agreements you need a supermajority of 70-80% of the votes to get a loan modification.*\n\n*So, to lower rents to market rates and get the building rented out, since you can\'t get a loan modification, you, the landlord, have to write a check to the bank to make up the difference between the value of the building at the old, higher rental rate and the value of the building at the new, lower rate. Or you can just do nothing, get an extra write off for your taxes, and hope some sucker comes in and rents at the higher price or a different sucker comes along and buys the place from you, making it their problem. This is why you\'ll see so many empty storefronts with ridiculous asking prices that the landlords won\'t budge on - it\'s because they can\'t.*\n\n*I really, really skimmed just the teeniest top of the surface on this subject, but basically all those CMBS notes that are super toxic start coming due in March of 2022, and they\'re going to absolutely detonate the commercial property market. Many banks and investment groups will be destroyed when these go bad, just like in 2008.*\n\n[Video of Empty Stores in NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqSUhVjS77o)\n\n*This is a video from a guy who just walked around downtown NYC showing all the empty stores and how the place basically looks like a dead mall now.*\n\n*TIMEFRAME: March 2022*\n\nWell, I said March 2022 was when these shit CMBS notes were going to start detonating/causing problems.  Let\'s check shall we?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[God that\'s a big shampoo commercial.](https://preview.redd.it/r77f17nd4kw81.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61734dd411a82c7f1ab2c6d68b750336a9454b9d)\n\nYou see that little spike at the end of the head and shoulders before it really dives to new all time lows?  Yeah, that\'s the last day of February, 2022.  \n\nOk, so that\'s 1/3 of the US real estate market, what about the 2/3rds of the market that\'s residential?  Well, this is where it gets weird, and how everyone (including me) kept missing it.  I\'ve written before about the issues with the US housing market - housing units relative to population has actually increased over the last decade+, while homeownership rates have dropped and prices have skyrocketed.  \n\nEveryone who looks at the residential market thinks its being bought by residents, and that all the people buying today are actually qualified buyers with good credit scores and jobs and such.  And that is true for all the people buying houses.  There is not a repeat of the 2008 sub-prime debacle with NINJA (No Income, No Job, no Assets) loans.  What is new - and whenever you get a financial crisis it\'s always, ALWAYS driven in large part by a "new" type of financial instrument (read debt) - is the sheer number of homes being bought up by with cash, and it\'s inferred these are all institutions and foreigners.  For example, about $90 billion in US real estate was bought by foreigners in 2021.  Wall Street however, blew that away, hitting as high as 1-in-7 of all homes and 1-in-2 of all apartments.\n\nNow, people look at that record institutional/foreigner buying and think it\'s the explanation, but the truth is, even with those crazy numbers, 6-in-7 homes and 1-in-2 apartments are still being bought by regular people, often with, again, "cash".\n\nThese purchases are frequently referred to as "cash buys" because the buyer just pays the seller cash.  However, they don\'t actually have piles of cash lying around in freighters to pay for this stuff.  They take out loans. Specifically, they take out loans on their equity assets.  Now this is where it starts getting sticky, because institutions are not buying these houses and apartments as residences, they\'re buying them as income generating properties.  \n\nIn traditional home mortgage loans, there are two things assessed: the value of the house, which acts as collateral for the loan, and the borrower\'s ability to pay back said loan via wages or assets.  It\'s a relatively simple two-factor risk analysis.\n\nNow, let\'s look at what risks the Wall Street owned rental homes are subject to: income generated/rental rates, housing values, stock/derivative values, interest rates, urban planning, crime rates, and overall market returns.  So basically, the money being loaned is getting assessed on a one-factor risk analysis: value of assets under management (AUM) of the borrower.  But then that money is getting used to buy a whole bunch of houses/apartments, and all of a sudden it\'s subject to a whole horde of other risks, and the original risk profile is more useless than you are with your compensated evening companionship after a couple drinks.\n\nThere\'s one other thing I haven\'t mentioned yet, that\'s huge, and the reason Wall Street never really messed around with buying up everyone\'s house before the 2008 crash.  And it\'s a big one:  Liquidity.  More specifically:  Liquidity of Assets.  Lemme say that one more time for the folks in the back recovering from barnyard animal sex gone wrong hearing loss:\n\n# Liquidity of Assets\n\nWut mean?  Glad you asked \'tard.  Liquidity of Assets (LoA) basically means how easy or hard it is to sell an asset.  Now, one of the reasons wall street hedge funds and investment banks can do things like leverage up at 37.5-1 (the theoretical max level they use) or, say, 200-1 (the level Goldman is at according to the last 13F filing I read) is because the money is backed by securities and derivatives and other financial instruments which are extremely liquid.  So if things go tits up like the Titanic, the lender can force a sell off of this stuff very quickly to get their money back.  Now in reality this isn\'t true, or Credit Suisse and Nomura wouldn\'t still be dragging around Archegos bags from last year, and Bill Hwang couldn\'t have pulled a Reddit meme and avoided margin calls by not answering the phone (yes, that really, actually, in real life, happened).  But in theory, it is.\n\nNow, housing?  Housing is illiquid as fuck.  It takes a lot of time and effort to sell a house.  Or to buy one.  There are special rules and whatnot from the federal government about what kind of collateral and stuff you need for a residential house.  2008 was so bad because the banks basically ignored all of those.  After 2008 one of the few things the government sort-of did fix was tightening up lending standards for retail (regular people), so everyone who\'s looking at the last crash sees that retail borrowers aren\'t overleveraged with bad loans and sub-prime and thinks it can\'t happen again.  But all those rules and whatnot get ignored if the buyer is paying "cash".  This is the financial equivalent of the military expression "Generals always fight the last war".  \n\n**The massive use of margin/equity backed loans by both retail and institutions to buy property has taken two separate markets, the liquid/volatile equity market, and the illiquid/stable housing market, and stitched them together like a human centipede with dogshit wrapped in catshit debt passing back and forth into one market that is unequally liquid and extremely price volatile.**\n\nIf you need proof that this is what\'s happening, lemme help you out with some charts that illustrate my point:\n\nThis is US Margin debt over the last few years\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/27i0k94w6pw81.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d42eb68f00af67a6afad37582123d3277c940409\n\nNow lets compare it to US home prices over the same period\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5d5qtnvbhpw81.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d60e5cbd4091a43a3e437532cb9fa414d4a345d9\n\nSo basically, we\'ve got loans on inflated assets fueling loans on other inflated assets.  This is feedback loop that goes parabolic.. then crashes, hard.  You can see the margin debt coming down and forming the first valley before it goes back up a little to complete the Head and Shoulders pattern, then drills down into the center of the earth.  Because housing is illiquid, it\'s going to lag that drop, but as you can see from the price curve leveling off, it\'s getting ready to do the same thing.\n\nNow, we know that there are a ton of loans using inflated, volatile collateral on illiquid, inflated assets.  And this is a certified bad thing.  But the coming death spiral of equity/asset sales isn\'t the only giant elephant in the room everyone is ignoring.  I\'m talking of course, about Evergrande in specific and Chinese property bonds in general.\n\nThe list of Chinese real estate developers that aren\'t paying their employees, debts, bonds, or suppliers is actually longer than you pretend your wang is, so we\'ll just use Evergrande as a proxy for the whole lot of them.\n\nEvergrande hasn\'t made hundreds of millions of dollars of interest payment on bonds since September.  A couple weeks ago they failed to pay the principal payment on a maturing bond to the tune of $2.1 Billion.  So, you\'d think that means their debt is junk and they\'ve defaulted, right?\n\nNot so fast.  Let\'s check what the big 3 ratings agencies have to say about it:\n\nFitch:  RD - Restricted Default\n\nS&amp;P: SD - Selective Default\n\nMoody\'s: Caa1- Rated as Poor Quality and Very High Credit Risk\n\nYou notice what\'s missing from all of those?  "D" - Default.  Evergrande has missed everything they can possibly miss, and they\'re still not rated D.  Hell, those brazen cockchuffers at Moody\'s actually have 4 separate ratings lower than what they\'re slapping on EG bonds.  Here, let me take a second to speak in the meme language you smooth brained retards actually might understand:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dc1p7y99fqw81.jpg?width=849&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7adb931a585d603db30e2b6b8456db353404948\n\nThe reason that none of these agencies will put the "D" on Evergrande bonds is twofold - \n\n1: they don\'t want to piss off the Chinese government\n\n2: the banks and hedge funds that are their primary clients are balls deep in this debt and can\'t get it off their books because shockingly people haven\'t forgotten how those same banks and hedge funds fucked, saddled, and rode them with garbage debt in 2008.\n\nWhy is this relevant to US housing, equities, and the margin loans financing the spiraling prices of both?  Easy.  The same people who hold the worthless Chinese debt also hold trillions of dollars of equities that they\'ve taken margin loans against to buy trillions of dollars of US Housing.  After Amazon\'s Q4 earngings, everyone who looked into them said "Holy crap!  The only thing holding up their ER is this $110 Billion Rivian valuation!"  Some people even made memes about it on WSB pointing out that it was the only thing holding up the entire US market.  Now, what happened when AMZN\'s Q1 ER came out and the RIVN valuation had dropped to more realistic levels?  Right, a -189% miss on earnings and a huge bear run on SPY and QQQ.  \n\n&gt;!Quick shout out to those of you who like to play options on stock lockup expiries - RIVN\'s lockup ends on May 8th, and AMZN and F have a ton of shares with a cost basis of $10 they can sell on or after that date.  The price is currently $30.  You do the math on if they want to hold onto that garbage once they can dump it at a profit.!&lt;\n\nThat\'s a huge drop in the collateral backing all that margin debt.  Is it enough to cause the Mother of all Margin Calls (MMC) and set off the worst crash since 1929?  Nope.  Not yet.  But it\'s coming.  Remember how people pointed out on AMZN\'s last ER how they were actually super fuk?  Yeah, you know who had a supposedly positive ER but is actually super-mega-fuk and just lied through their teeth about it? Apple.  AAPL doesn\'t have a single factory working right now, and their by far #1 market - China - is in the midst of complete economic collapse.  &gt;!(the politburo doesn\'t have emergency meetings about giant spending packages because things are going well)!&lt;  They gave zero guidance on either of these things, which makes me think that it\'s even worse than I think it is, and I think it\'s fucking horrible.  But back to the bad Chinese debt. The reason Wall Street can survive a hit to something like AMZN and the indexes is that they\'re hedged to the balls for stuff like that.  Know what they\'re not hedged for?  Chinese property bonds universally going to zero.\n\nSo what happens when the collateral for those margin loans goes down?  I\'m sure you retards behind Wendy\'s have all heard this one before - you get a margin call.  First, you (or more likely your broker) sells equities.  But if equities are all dropping, they comin\' for that money, and they\'re looking at your assets to get it.  Guess what?  Housing and commercial real estate are both assets they can force sales on.  So that same self-reinforcing spiral that drove up both equity and real estate prices?  It\'s going to go into reverse, but here\'s the thing, when everyone is selling at the same time, prices go down really, really, really, really, really, really fast.\n\nWe learned this last time in 2008.  This time, because the housing market is directly tied to the crashing stocks, instead of indirectly through people who will default over time as they lose their jobs or balloon payments come due or rates adjust, it\'s going to happen all at once, faster and more violently.  We actually got a brief preview of what this is going to look like thanks to the wild incompetence and greed at Zillow - Z.  Their stock crashed 40% in five days when it was revealed they\'d bought too many houses they couldn\'t rent or flip and had to sell them at a loss.  And that was just a couple of neighborhoods in Arizona.  When this hits nationwide, it\'s going to be exponentially worse.\n\nHow much worse?  Well, that depends on where you are.  Here\'s some graphs explaining that while the US is fuk, somehow our Maple Swiling neighbors to the north are exponentially worse off - life lesson, don\'t tie yourself to China kids.\n\nThis is bad, but it\'s kind of hiding how bad because the data cuts off too soon after the COVID crash.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp2lg6eqrqw81.jpg?width=390&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea798013a5e45454c0be8e952c08b61ec0926728\n\nYeah, Canada.. I\'m sorry maple\'s.  It\'s gonna be rough.  Good luck, and care with RBC, pretty sure that between a huge position in Chinese debt and an incredible number of soon to be bad mortgages and margin loans they\'re completely worthless.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oaxud29rrqw81.jpg?width=461&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c533ad7efe260d452a16e99cced6185e46b40449\n\nLook, I started writing DD\'s last fall saying we\'d just gone into recession but nobody noticed and everyone laughed at me and said I was crazy.  After that Q1 GDP miss it looks a bit different, ya?  Last summer I wrote about how CMBS was fuk and it would start coming due in March 2022, and people pointed and laughed.  See the chart earlier in this post.  Now I\'m telling you that the banks and the Fed and every fucking person has fucked up and missed that real estate and equities have gotten tied up in a gordian knot that\'s getting sucked into a black hole of failure.  I\'d like to be wrong.  I\'ve been wrong before (see my terrible takes on corporate hedging of HYG for an example), but I don\'t think I\'m wrong here.  \n\nThe market and housing and everything is going down like Anne Robbins trying to get off the Hollywood black list.  I\'ve never given dates before because I didn\'t have a good enough idea of when things would finally hit a critical mass.  If we keep following the 2008 chart (thanks for being predictable algorithms!) we\'re going to go up for a couple of weeks then crash sometime between the end of May and the middle/end of July.  Summer collapses are historically rather rare, so I like this fall myself, but I wouldn\'t be surprised by either outcome.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zx4dri9tqw81.jpg?width=275&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b6cbdadfa3f647e7f086b32478feea9136bc500\n\n**TL;DR:** **In 2008, the unknown weapons of financial mass destruction were sub-prime loans, MBS, CDS, and CDOs.  In 2022 they\'re margin loans, asset backed loans, Chinese bonds, and "cash" purchased assets.**\n\nThis is how inflation leaked into the real economy from the assets it was supposed to be segregated in.  Fed printer goes brrrrr --&gt; assets inflate --&gt; margin loans against assets drive up real estate --&gt; owners of real estate suddenly have lots of extra money --&gt; inflation.\n\nAs of November of \'21, the Fed had printed $13 Trillion since the start of COVID.  $1 Trillion was stimmies.  The rest?  The rest went to the rich via inflated asset prices and debt purchases.  Don\'t believe them when they try to blame this shitshow on stimmies and the just now conveniently-mentioned-in-the-media "return of sub-prime loans" bit.  They just want a chance to blame this on poor people and immigrants to avoid having anyone look at them.  And don\'t think JPow\'s greedy ass can save you this time, to match the financial impact of what the Fed did during COVID they\'d have to print nearly $60 Trillion.  That\'s Weimar Republic territory, if we\'re not headed there already.\n\n\\*Sources include but not limited to: FRED, Statista, CoreLogic, FINRA'), ('I’m the “AMZN insider” I blew up my trading account on AMZN 1900FDs', 'I’m the “AMZN insider” I blew up my trading account on AMZN 1900FDs'), ('TSLA twtr / Acquisition plays', "TSLA twtr / Acquisition playsTSLA had a drastic decrease due to Elon selling shares to buy twitter...

It was range bound for much of 2021, and it\'s failed breakout in November was really the start of this down trend *at the index level* (many stocks were down throughout 2021). \n* Earlier this year it broke through the bottom end of it\'s 2021 trading range as selling spread to the other indices, and never managed to bounce back up. It didn\'t really participate in that massive rip in the second half of March, which I thought was an obvious red flag.   \nNow, it\'s broken below it\'s lower range - with 190-192 being lower support - and I think we\'re headed for *it\'s pre-covid high* of 170 (!)\n\nSince we started to fade that March rally it\'s been my stance that we\'re headed lower, and if we\'re to believe *there\'s no such thing as triple bottoms* then the target was always to break under these recent support levels.   \nI think the impetus here is we\'ve finally started to see the mega cap tech names that have held up these indices so well roll over. People have lately been pointing out that we\'ve seen these drawdowns start in the shittiest/riskiest areas of the market - e.g. SPACs at the start of last year - and move down the risk curve, and ultimately nothing is safe. This is generally how a bear market happens.   \n\n\n[RUA 5y](https://preview.redd.it/5fsry8p96ow81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b74710de4050b6e3bb695cc8e8befd96b74da41)\n\n* Lastly, looking at the RUA - the Russel 3000 / virtually the entire US stock market - my guess is we\'re likely to visit that 2300 area in the near-term. \n\n# Sectors\n\n[Sector Performance 6m](https://preview.redd.it/mrqa6vcg6ow81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1151356ed7d2ec95af19aed9a084907829eef251)\n\n* This is a pretty busy, but handy chart I look at to give me an idea of relative performance across many market sectors. It\'s been useful the last few years as we\'ve had a ton of rotation between different areas of the market, and this can help me spot that and trade momentum accordingly.\n* Last week I noted some recent relative outperformance of sector defensive sectors like healthcare, energy, and consumer staples. We\'re actually starting to see those now succumb to the selling endemic in the rest of the market.  If our overall recession / bear case is valid, then this is expected, and unfortunately we may have to act like nothing is safe.   \n\n\n[XLU 1y](https://preview.redd.it/18chg3c07ow81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daab669046da193e1d8bfa2c0abe1fab40ffc9db)\n\n* I also previously noted the outperformance of utilities, which usually do not perform well in a rising rate environment. Well, we\'ve seen them give back the entirety of their recent move, and these could very well be heading back lower as often happens with a failed breakout.  \n\n\n[XLI 5y](https://preview.redd.it/gffzyr1m7ow81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d95d47df758da897a3c1f109e7b2bae9f00c777)\n\n* I also previously talked about Dow theory and the relationship between industrials and utilities - industrials never confirmed the breakout in utilities, and are now actually looking like they\'re breaking lower from the range they\'ve been stuck in for a year. This is also pretty bearish. \n\nOof, this week has not been good...\n\n# Bonds, Dollar, Sentiment\n\n[US10Y All Time](https://preview.redd.it/rczkad8jivw81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d6986636fd1a990f73e852d32185a1ba77c6e1d)\n\n* Whatever way you draw the trend line, we\'re breaking out above it. Bond volatility has continued, this week alone trading in a 20bps range. Will we finally find some resistance here around 3% and take a breather?   \n\n\n[DXY all-time](https://preview.redd.it/prkwlrhr8ow81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=165b58f99571cfe2913e0cb0e22ddad08549bb8b)\n\n* The DXY, or US dollar index, has been talked about much lately. We\'ve had historic moves in currency pairs, and the DXY is an index of the US dollar vs a basket of other major currencies, most notably the Euro. I wanted to zoom out here to give an idea of just how historic this move is - the DXY above 100 is notable, and this past week we broke above the 102 level which has been the top level of the range we\'ve been in since 2015. \n* This is notable because there are [all sorts of trades](https://www.investopedia.com/carry-trade-definition-4682656) that can start to blow up as these FX moves continue, and these can introduce or exacerbate all kinds of volatility in all kinds of financial assets. Basically, this can get really fucking bad really fucking quick, and does not portend well for markets across the world.   \n\n\n[AAII Sentiment Survey](https://preview.redd.it/qoj98e2lbvw81.png?width=855&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b34bd4b268c5fcfef07adeb29bd8a10725f999f6)\n\n* Sentiment got even worse this past week, which can be expected given the price action. \n* Sentiment has been much talked about lately, but despite the overall bearish sentiment indicated by various surveys / indicators there\'s not been a real indication of a "washout" - heavy, indiscriminate selling and panic that can indicate max capitulation and a possible bottom.  \n \n\n*Processing img t7p57ymhbow81...*\n\n* NYSE new lows (in orange) are still elevated while stocks making new highs (in blue) are basically non-existent. Interestingly, even with all that selling on Friday we saw the new lows decrease - that might be an indication that Friday\'s selling was very much in stocks *that have been holding up well,* and not in those that have already been making new lows, which reinforces this idea that selling is spreading to all parts of the market at this point. \n\n# Some Thoughts\n\nI think we\'re getting to some conditions where we have to start entertaining the idea that this isn\'t just a pullback / correction but instead the start of a bear market and a very series correction. This would be an extreme bearish view, but something like 350 on SPY would represent a 26% drawdown and 50% fib retracement of the covid rally (from the March 2020 lows to the recent top), which would actually be reasonable if we see a true washout - market conditions are there to really exacerbate selling.   \nNow I\'ve no clue if this will happen, but I\'d expect we first have to break meaningfully below that 4000-4050 level on SPX. \n\nEarnings-wise, while Q1 reports have been great, Q2 guidance has been somewhat poor. We\'re likely to see continued supply chain problems with China unable to cope with covid, inflationary pressures and uncertainty likely to hit consumer and business sentiment/behavior, and lastly the macro challenge with the dollar\'s strength and Europe and other countries entering a recession.   \nI have some expectation we\'ll see companies freezing hiring and laying off employees (we\'re already seeing this), having over-compensated for the last few years and now needing to readjust based on "normalizing" demand (whatever the new normal is) and facing margin pressures and uncertainty due to the macro picture.  \nSuffice to say I think Q2 earnings are going to be garbage, but hopefully we\'ll see things get better in the second half of this year. \n\nOf course, I price is the best indication of sentiment and I may have a completely different view by this time next week.'), ('Need Help: Question on $LABU', 'Need Help: Question on $LABUI am planning to invest a good % of my portfolio into $LABU in this bear market.

Due to a spike in energy prices, solar power is a NO BRAINER for ooftops, providing better gains for the consumer than the index (8-10% annual ROI in savings easily, even in Nordics). This has already resulted in a MASSIVE organic demand (and shortage) for inverters and solar panels. IMHO this is NOT yet priced in. $ENPH has a growing stake in EU and US with a killer product and growth trajectory.  \n\n\nThis post consists of the follow parts:\n\n1. Background\n2. Why now?\n3. My background / DD \n4. The play I\'ve chosen: $ENPH  \n\n\n**1.** **BACKGROUND**\n\nAs many of you are aware, Russia invaded Ukraine. As a result (and even before that), energy prices for retail and businesses are going up for kWh that we consume. This has resulted in energy prices already going TRIPLE per kWh than what it was just 3-6 months ago in Europe. Europe wants to get rid of hard dependency for Russian energy QUICK, and nuclear power takes too long to build. Even the Italian prime minister said: "you can have air conditioning or peace." Of course oil prices go up, but that\'s a short-term play by my standards.\n\nAnd no, energy prices will not drop soon. Even before the recent spike energy prices have gone up by 2% annually on average with expectations of far higher increases.\n\nSolar will not cover 100% of our energy needs. The sun doesn\'t shine all the time, and batteries that cover whole nights for whole cities are unrealistic. But a rooftop solar installation can easily cover 20-70% of a households all energy needs/expenses (+20% -points with a battery). That can mean 1000$-3000$ annual savings with a system that has a lifespan of 30-50 years.\n\n**2. WHY NOW?**\n\n**Just 6 months ago installing a solar system in Nordics would have had roughly a 3-4% annual ROI. Now it\'s 8-10% annual ROI. And now the whole Europe is running out of inverters and panels (especially inverters) due to increased ORGANIC demand.**\n\nNot only that, but with the ambitious climate goals, renewable energy will stay pretty much un-taxed for the next 10 years. In EU, it\'s ridiculously easy to apply for:  \na) businesses to apply for 20% grant for installing solar power  \nb) farms to get up to 40% grant for installing solar  \nc) **CONSUMER HOMES get 10-15% tax-back from installation**\n\nEven apartment complexes with multiple apartments can now fairly distribute the savings due to recent legistlation changes.\n\nAnd think about the move towards EV\'s. Solar power complements it very well with increased energy demand when charging your vehicle at home or other locations.\n\n**3. MY BACKGROUND / DD**\n\nI\'m an entrepreneur and a mathematician. I\'ve calculated the ROI (8-10%+ annual for consumer home-owners) taking into account just about every variable, including where the roof faces, angle of roof, geographic location, cost of buying and price of selling electricity, taxes, most profitable solar system for any home etc. I found out that just during the last few weeks the whole Europe is running short of inverters and solar panels. Yes, semiconductors is one reason for this, but even more so a huge organic demand that has appeared due to increased electricity kWh price. \n\nTo be more specific, a solar system will work for about 10-20% of homes by my estimates, though it varies from region to region. A huge market, but not for all homes. The exceptions happen due to rooftop renovations that are coming up, big trees making shadows on panels for majority of the day, rooftops facing mostly north (west-south-east are all fine, contrary to popular beliefs). \n\nI will say that I don\'t know the US market as well, though I know electricity prices are jumping up there too and based on what I see, solar would be very much viable there too right now even if it doesn\'t provide as much ROI in some states as Europe does.\n\nIf a consumer buys a solar system for their rooftop, they basically have a factory manufacturer guarantee that it will produce good amount of electricity for 25+ years, covering your initial investment multiple times over (up to 5 times for my home, taking everything to account from component degradation to electricity price increases).\n\n**4. THE PLAY I\'VE CHOSEN: $ENPH**\n\nSolar is a huge market opportunity, and it\'s no doubt it will grow on all of it\'s sectors in the coming years. You could choose a solar ETF like $TAN or $RAYS or something thats not strictly solar like Generac, but I decided to stick to what I believe I understand: primarily rooftop solar systems with strong consumer markets (as I believe there to be a MASSIVE growing demand) with a killer product.\n\n**I don\'t want to rely on our politicians to somehow gather the money for big solar power plants. I trust that the markets function, and in this case the markets will function in the sense that consumers will get considerable savings if they can put aside 5-15k$/€ (or get a renovation loan for it).** Nobody cared about the climate when the stock market was in an all-time bull run and solar panels only provided a measly 3% ROI annually. But now... Everyone is afraid to put money in the market and this provides a guaranteed savings on a growing electricity bill that are better than SPY? Sign me up right now!\n\nPanels are always needed, but based on what I can see, anyone can still get solar panels of some kind but they can\'t find inverters. Solar panels are running out too though.\n\nMany european inverter manufacturers are family or private equity -owned and not public. However, ENPH has a growing stake in the european market, and it\'s growing fast for a GOOD REASON.\n\nThe micro-inverter is amazing, and it\'s even AFFORDABLE AND THE INTELLIGENT PURCHASE from consumer point of view. It even has 3-4 times the WARRANTY that other manufacturers offer their inverters, the one weak point in a solar system (experts estimate that you\'d have to replace your inverter every 10-15 years. Not so with this.) Honestly, I believe that this product whole-heartedly. It kicks ass when compared to what the competitors offer.\n\nThe financials:\n\n* Record quarterly revenue of $441 million \n* GAAP gross margin of 40.1% \n* $1.2B in cash \n* Beat analyst estimates already 4 quarters in a row.\n* \\+78,5% revenue growth from 2020 to 2021\n* Is actually profitable and growing at a great pace.\n* "**Is tripling down in Europe"** aka to me, capturing the opportunity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy positions: \n\n$12.000 of $ENPH @ $168. May go in with more later.\n\nI\'m ready to stay in this play for a long time. The next earnings report will be out in July. I may look into options closer to earnings date, as I believe that booming sales season together with organic demand with a killer product will do well in the next months. Especially with solar, you will get the most organic demand when the sun shines. This is somewhat priced in though.'), ('TSLA can be the next NFLX IF the spell breaks', "TSLA can be the next NFLX IF the spell breaksNFLX remained overvalued for a good 3-4ish years before tanking.

(Part 2)In case you missed part 1, you can find it here. Read the disclaimer.\n\nWhy are micro-transactions so unbelievably more profitable than old fashion game sales? If you paid attention, you’d know that I mentioned exactly why above. \nIt’s the **reoccurring purchases.**\nYou spend a dollar here, a dollar there and before you know it, you’ve spent tens if not hundreds of dollars on virtual cosmetics and power-ups.\nSound familiar?\nFreemium games are so much more profitable, because people spend money as if it were merchandise: It’s never one single purchase, but many reoccurring purchases.\nHowever, there is one slight problem which is, **you can only charge so much for a virtual toy** …\n\n\n\n\n\n**This is where we get to the DCs.**\n\nAs I’ve said above, you’ve already spent money on virtual “assets”. \nThe difference between a typical virtual good and an DC virtual good is how it works…\n\nLet me paint a picture. You’re playing GTA 5 and you really want that Zentorno (for those who don’t know what this is, your childhood sucked and I feel sorry for you. It’s a car.).\nSo you spend 10 bucks on a Shark Card (It’s like a ticket to redeem for GTA dollars, you poor bastard) and you buy your Zentorno.\nThere’s a limit to how much money you’re gonna spend on a virtual car that you’ll never sell and that can be duplicated and gotten for free. In other words you’re not going to spend $100 on it…\nHowever, what if it literally couldn’t be duped. What if you COULD resell it and get some if not more money back than what you paid for it. What if you could export it from the game and store it elsewhere.\nThat is **true virtual merchandise.**\nThat’s the only difference between a digital good and a DC and I ASSURE you with 100% certainty, that all these video game digital goods will be DCs in the near future because they have literally every incentive to do so (Think about all the effort GTA goes through to patch duplication glitches. Making your virtual goods DCs negates any need for this.).\n\n*Time for some quick myth busting before we continue.\n- “You can screenshot a DC”\nYes, you can screenshot a dumb fucking monkey picture. But you can’t screenshot and drive a Zentorno.\n- “People will be able to create cheap Zentorno knockoffs and import them into the game.” \nRETARD. Every transaction history is stored. EVERYTHING. Do you seriously think the developers would allow your shitty Zentorno ripoff anywhere near their game? No, they won’t. And there’s absolutely 0 chance of you ever tricking them. They know with 100% certainty where the real Zentornos came from, where they are currently, how many there are, how many there ever will be. \nThus your ripoff is worthless.\n- “DCs have no utility and are therefore worthless”\nStupid monkey pictures are worthless.\nA Zentorno in a game that people play and care about is NOT worthless. And we know this because people spend money on them already with 0 chance of seeing that money again. There IS value in virtual goods and that is a fact.\n- “If they made the Zentorno and other cars into DCs, they would just be used as speculative investments”\nWrong. Stop associating DCs with JPEG moon-boi scams.\nThe cars will be the same as before, their value might fluctuate but nothing too crazy. There probably will be some super expensive super rare cars in the secondary market but it really isn’t such a bad thing. Anyone who’s played GTA knows that people love to show off their “rare modded” car collection in their garage.\nHaving actual real rarity and value only adds to that experience.\nBesides, the developers will never let that get in the way of the gaming experience, there will always be other more accessible, cheaper, just as good cars.*\n\n\nAlright back to the DD.\nSo we already covered how profitable the micro-transaction business model is thanks to their reoccurring sales (Just like merchandise).\nWe also covered where the video-games still fall short as you can only charge so much for a virtual toy.\nDCs will essentially allow for video-game companies to charge real merchandise prices for their virtual goods and people WILL pay it.\n\n\n\n**So… Recap!**\n\nRemember Pokemon.\nLicensed merchandise revenue: $82.8B\nVideo-game revenue: $27.1B (18% of which came from a single freemium game with little $1-$10 micro transactions, outperforming all 121 other video-games by a fucking landslide)\n  Just fucking imagine how much Pokemon GO would have made if instead of charging $1-$5 micro transactions, they charged real world merchandise prices of $10-$500. Yeah…\nTheir gaming division will match and **surpass** their merch division (which represents revenue growth of 300% at the very least) and so will every other IP. (I invite you to look at other IPs and compare their merch revenue and gaming revenue. The difference between the two is basically guaranteed growth)\nAdd to that the ease of instantaneous exchange of virtual merch versus the headaches and limitations of exchanging real world merch… very appealing.\nOh, and did I mention that the gaming industry boasts a clientele of nearly 3 billion people?\n\n**OH! And by the way, all of this isn’t even taking into account the perpetual royalties and fees the gaming companies will be making on literally every single transaction after their DC merchandise hits their secondary markets. Seriously, think about that for a good minute.**\n\nSo that right there is why DCs will cause the gaming industry to absolutely fucking boom\n\n\nAs for a stock pick.\nWon’t be talking much fundamentals here as I want to keep this part short.\nEveryone talked about Facebook Meta during the MetaV hype train.\nI’m looking at Microsoft though.\nI think MSFT is a no-brainer buy right now. \nThey want to focus more on the gaming industry.\nThere’s a reason why they bought Activision Blizzard at the time that they did. \nThey now own World of Warcraft which is basically a metaV in itself (MetaV and DCs go hand in hand).\nAs a company that already has a huge established presence in both hardware and software for gaming, I believe that they are the best positioned blue-chip to take advantage of this industry boom that’ll inevitably come.\n\n\nTL/DR: The micro transactions business model beats the traditional game sale model by a landslide thanks to perpetual reoccurring sales. \nHowever you can only charge so much for a virtual toy or power-up.\n“Digital collectibles” (read the disclaimer at the top) will allow gaming companies to combine the power of reoccurring sales with the higher real world prices of merchandise which will enormously boost revenue.\nAdd the perpetual royalty fees on every single transaction.\nMSFT to the moon.'), ('5-4-22 SPY, Apple, QQQ, VIX Daily TA', '5-4-22 SPY, Apple, QQQ, VIX Daily TA  \n\nWell holy fuck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2xytqeb2sjx81.png?width=544&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3eaf8ae397df473f52f20e621aea6cc221d4482d\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lvvczkp2sjx81.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a9c386bf18e4d2e461c3d5564ed508b0d628896\n\nI think that effectively sums up the who FOMC meeting.

We have officially broken outta the bear channel from April 21st to present. However, we have not broken the 15min bear resistance line from March 29th that puts us near 442. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbazyth4sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f99ea0758f76382a45c3751af5cd49d52f8a9d8\n\nOne thing bulls need to be careful of is that we now see a TRIPLE top formed on the 15minute chart at 430 from March 26th, March 28th and today. We rejected pretty hard there and have fallen pretty hard from that high after hours now. There is definitely question whether we continue rally tomorrow or retrace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/is3wg815sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b11d9e61cd40a3f27d83fc2a069cd1def991696\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cu2j2k5sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a75000d47918f6b03c5d4cc4b2c971d03bb260b\n\nCurrent daily chart you can see we have NOT broken the bear channel there YET. We actually perfectly rejected the top resistance line much like April 21st. This resistance line also happens to be the Daily 20ema too. \n\nBulls are going to need to see a clean green day tomorrow and try to close around 437 to confirm a breakout and step far away from this bear channel. \n\nHowever, if the bears are able to keep up this after hours rally (bear rally) then we may see a nice red open and test support down close to 423 and even 420 tomorrow. As long as bears can open this red and keep it under 428 tomorrow they maintain the integrity of the bar channel but will need a pretty red day to get low enough that Friday doesn’t break trend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vz8vkc6sjx81.png?width=841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02b570fb5942b1816522fd36647de02f8bd1151\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/930w7sr6sjx81.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de3ea1b9f94eb1f5570762e6a405c57c0c780366\n\nOne thing that may help the bears though is the fact the VIX went from a high of 29.42 today all the way down to 24.94 at its lows before it bounced off that 25 level. \n\nThis is the first time the VIX has been touched below 25 since April 22nd. As I have been saying the current 3 week long vix trend has been between 26.5 to 36.5 with a mean of 29 to 32.6. Now that we have broken lower we could see a return to the previous mean levels of 25 to 18.7 before we had the massive sell off. However, after what could be argued as a massive over reaction to the FOMC announcement and press conference we very well COULD see a reversion to mean tomorrow on VIX and SPY. That’s the way I am playing the rest of the week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jk3a7a7sjx81.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a29c672c98c9fd1541cd200f2ffadf7468b59fd\n\nAs you can see Apple has broken one bear channel BUT has not fully broken the lower highs yet as you can see below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ce4l2fq7sjx81.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2c29a07101d5832fd44a1fa353229aecbc15de6\n\nMuch like SPY apple is RIGHT at is channel resistance line and will need to see a pretty significant move downward over night which it has done after hours to lock this bear channel in. If bears can keep this under 165.7 at open and maintain a red day tomorrow they should hold bear channel integrity and look for a retest of the daily 8ema closer to 161.6 and eventually the daily 200ema near 158.25.\n\nHowever, if bulls get the breakout we are gonna look to test that resistance peak from April 21st at 171.5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faqx6td8sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e8a6f677606aaaa2a67be578af078a9f6ea8fc4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2prpuvu8sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcfb3249b03fe2aac2adafc70ea49452c3ade0b\n\nAs you can see QQQ too maintains a bear channel. With a rejection of its daily 20ema and the bear channel with a after hours retrace. If the bears can maintain a high of 328 (which is also a major support/ resistance line) tomorrow then they will look to push red and test lower supports of 323 and 317. \n\nBulls will look to break through the daily 20ema of 332 and eventually test the daily 50ema of 342.\n\nSo whats the theme here? We had a hell of a bull rally today but we are not outta the bear woods yet. And even IF we see a short term bull run we are still on all tickers a overall bear channel. I would equate this to a bear market rally. I don’t know how big it will be or when it will stop but we soon will find out. There is a case to be made that we are going to break down again tomorrow and will end up back at the lows of the week before Fridays close. However, bulls have an opportunity to break some highs and close a green week after 4 red weeks in a row. As long as SPY closes above 412 it will break its 4 red week trend right now. However, it does not mean it breaks the bear trend. I would again call this a bear market rally. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nMan big oof here. Today is one of those days where you watch your account go from massive loss to big profits. I took advantage of the FOMC run and scalped tons of profits today. I watched my account around 11am this morning go from negative two times weekly profit goal to now close of market being up one times weekly profit goal. \n\nSometimes when we are facing red we have to keep fighting but we have to be smart about how we fight. This morning and really all day 0dte was not paying well and was just burning me so I made a switch to 2dte and they paid like crazy. Now that I am in profits for the week I will look to take some risk off tomorrow and Friday and try to end with 2x weekly profits if I can. \n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gt5h9syasjx81.png?width=457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5e78923d6d195e3f035898eac7ef6a7ae8dfe3f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also cleared out my account positions and will talk about that here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4tkiwrkbsjx81.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3ed2c0e413a536d443717ef0988aadbb99d2d1b\n\nSo overall this is what I carried over night last night.\n\n\\-I close the MES cashed secured puts for 5% before the JPOW rally (regrets but I took a calculated risk as rallying $10 we coulda easily fallen $10 and with the losses I was at I could NOT risk my account with that drop). I will look to see how rest of the week plays out and see if I resell my puts or hold till after CPI on Wednesday\n\n\\- EOD I closed the 441C for 52% profits\n\n\\-EOD closed the 432C for 60% profits\n\n\\-before JPOW I closed the 421c  for -52% and the 423C for -70%. Of course I had no way of knowing we were going to see 430 and I wanted to salvage what I could. I fully anticipated the best bull case of 425. Which barely woulda breaken those even but with theta eating 0dte up like crazy I had to exit when I could. It was quite a large loss and that’s what I found back from all day. \n\nThat’s the hard part we have to make calculated risks. I should have just closed last night at -32% and -55% but I expected a morning rally but that didn’t happen so I took a bigger loss. However, had the morning dump been a morning rally I woulda got paid huge on my risk. In the end we have to stop letting losers run so long. I still struggle on this and especially in this wacky market I struggle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gc4gp7csjx81.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e409866141d12a92b4cc66d5686a6f8863aa4279\n\nCurrently this is what im holding… So my goal for those 59dte CALLS were to hold till 430 maybe 440. But I expected a bit of a slower run up. I think 430 could be our top and at 50% I felt I needed to take profits now. \n\nSo I am now repositioning for the next drop. End of day today I purchased a overnight put 2dte 428P and I also picked up some 382p (15 delta) 57dte puts. My goal with these is to add one put for every $2.5 we go over 430. So I will next add at $432.5, $435, etc.   \n \n\nI have no doubt that we will revisit within the next 60dte 400 range. And when we do I will look to make similar profits like I did off the 60dte calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjjcp6scsjx81.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fa540c390e5d1279d7fca9fc0cf0b69aba0f4d4\n\nTook a gamble on the hyperwheel and loss… as you can see the Buy and hold is far exceeding my hyperwheel return. However, I have no contracts currently open so I am risk off right now. As I mentioned I was not comfortable with not knowing if we would dump or rocket after JPOW.

Waves 1, 3, and 5 are long and predictable uptrends (new investors enter bullish positions because everyone else is bullish). Waves 2 and 4 are short and unpredictable countertrends (investors are now getting cold feet because the price has been moving up for a while and there is uncertainty as to whether the current price accurately represents the value of a share, so people sell). Wave 5 is always followed by a relatively large countertrend correction.\n\n*Trends and Countertrends -* A trend (in this context) usually just means a bull market. Price is moving upwards, followed by a small correction, followed by another period of bullish price movement. This is when you should be trading because **trends are predictable.** Countertrends are the bearish price corrections that occur after a bullish trend in order to confirm support levels. Countertrends can take many different forms and are therefore very unpredictable. **You should not trade during countertrends because, again, price movement is not predictable.** \n\nI was going to go on to explain some bearish patterns and other basic jargon but I know you\'re not gonna read it.

Trust me, this will all come together soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current SPY Chart. Ruh-Roh Raggy. ](https://preview.redd.it/1fm3s7vwzrx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0912c7f7d6052e29d0c7dcc7498d26d81a06fbe9)\n\nLooking at these three charts, we could easily circle-jerk talking about a recession until our balls fall off just like every other post in this subreddit that contains these images and is drawing those conclusions. Instead, I\'ll just show you my analysis and let you draw your own, very intelligent conclusions that I am sure are not based on fear or greed whatsoever. \n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen, I Present the "oh fuck" Zone** \n\nStock drops after an aggressive push upwards, forming a new resistance line at the peak. Following this, new support will form at a level that I have deemed the "oh fuck" zone, or a zone in which the price will breach critical support and plummet to a new low. You\'ll notice that there are recurring patterns and sequences that present themselves in every chart that I will show you after this brief breakdown of the "oh fuck" pattern.\n\nIt usually goes like this:\n\n1. Stock drops after an aggressive push upwards, forming a new resistance line at the peak.\n2. SPY fights back above that resistance line but is unable to produce a trend upwards. It then tumbles down below this resistance.\n3. After that, you\'ll see bearish price action as SPY gasps for air but is unable to successfully recover above resistance.\n4. The "oh fuck" zone is breached and SPY dumps. Hard.\n\nHere\'s the 2018 chart. It\'s easy to analyze because it\'s very cut and dry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The \\\\"Oh Fuck\\\\" Zone \\(2018\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qwmnkelj1sx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ba591bed177665f6e560e3ba1df29028bc3c972)\n\nHere\'s the crash of 2008.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The 2008 Crash, Charted](https://preview.redd.it/rt5qxkfw1sx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f81919bea43ad7aa8e6c4ec18fde0dfcc4debb78)\n\nAnd here\'s where we are now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current Chart, With \\\\"oh fuck\\\\" Zone](https://preview.redd.it/qrywz4rd2sx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6e0ef1e93641693d5092d3c2e702a9b38fdc54e)\n\nNow, you might be thinking "but how do you know this isn\'t a trendy move and we\'re not just gonna shoot up from here? Don\'t stocks only go up? It\'s easy to draw lines on a chart for price moves that have already happened", and honestly, you\'d be correct. I don\'t know for a fact that this is a guaranteed recession signal. For example, here\'s a chart showing where SPY recovered from a similar pattern in 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[An example of SPY recovering from the \\\\"oh fuck\\\\" pattern, 2019](https://preview.redd.it/xtvewx2e4sx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec073c233e4611271f0a265ba4492dfe3fba270)\n\n**Now, how do we know when to expect these patterns?** \n\nI\'m glad you asked. This is where the Elliott Waves come into play. We can predict the severity of bearish price movement by determining where we are on the Elliott Wave pattern. If we are on waves 1 or 3, we can expect the countertrends of waves 2 or 4 to be relatively short and mild. If we are on wave 5, we can expect a shitshow as soon as the 5th wave trend ends. \n\nAnd guess where we are now. That\'s right. We are in the middle of a massive countertrend following the previous 5th wave trend. This happens every couple of years, but we are overdue for the big one. Here\'s a chart showing our current position on the Elliott Waves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Our Current Position Along the Elliott Wave](https://preview.redd.it/a1wt5nxuktx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7abc8d8176cb58394459c250c0a6b811899428a1)\n\nIn all honesty, there\'s no telling where we go from here. But one thing is for certain, this is a massive countertrend. Keep in mind that the term "countertrend" doesn\'t mean that the price only goes down. It might go up and down over a period of time. Being in a countertrend really just means that we are in the middle of price movement that is not trendy, or goes against the previous trend. We can\'t accurately predict the price movement of a countertrend, which is why we are all getting fucked on moves that we thought we had all figured out. If you still don\'t understand, here\'s a couple charts showing you what a countertrend really looks like and the unpredictability that lies within.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2018 Countertrend](https://preview.redd.it/3av5v3a1mtx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f4a80b25b0a5958a49d43073086e9b1cf4cfc87)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2008 Countertrend](https://preview.redd.it/0rncil04mtx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c6fb5c91b43880c57aac13db87b7098cb37ff02)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current Countertrend](https://preview.redd.it/pbfg2uj8mtx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e85505ebcdb20f2788db056599a100f0af6c85)\n\nAs you can see, there is money to be made on both Call and Put options within these trends at certain points. If you still want to participate in the market during this absolute shit circus, here\'s a couple methods I would suggest using before entering any positions. \n\n**Yet Another Post Comparing 2022 to 2008**\n\nI know that this has been done before. A lot. But it\'s almost obligatory that I include a hypothetical scenario regarding our current SPY price to the 2008 chart. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here\'s a side-by-side without drawings or markers.](https://preview.redd.it/ff3tkaointx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba835731f29dcd5c1aa4f60b25ecadda55cda6b8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[And Here\'s a Chart With a Super Shitty Price Correlation Map](https://preview.redd.it/whqsbyenntx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43c00a18b90f775a8d916740d5dcc2594e7a158f)\n\n"It\'s not identical! some of the price moves are way longer or shorter", yes I know. You are right about this as well. This map is mainly here to highlight the similarities in price action and how the market responded to those movements. And those reactions mimic each other very well. This kind of price action doesn\'t happen every day. But of course, formulate your own opions based on your own research. Don\'t let me stop you from buying those weekly calls.\n\nIf I were to guess, I\'d say we hit 450 again before we dump. We might dump before then, I can\'t guarantee anything. Fuck it, we might not even dump at all. But I know for certain that if SPY cannot break the resistance above 450 and produce a bullish trend, we will dump harder than you ever thought was possible. With JPOW\'s speech at the FOMC basically saying "fuck it we ball", there is no real solution being presented in order to fix this massive looming economic correction. In fact, this potential recession is key to recovering the health of the economy. It might be the only thing that can fix this shit. I mean, you gotta remember that recessions are necessary for a healthy economy and they are inevitable. Of course, better monetary policy could have been enacted to soften the blow, but it\'s a bit too late for that.\n\n**So...**\n\nHere\'s a Fib trend retracement of SPY currently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current Chart - Fibonaci Retracement ](https://preview.redd.it/9i2fjvobqtx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d567c5913439ae194b3ed232895b68e3094dce31)\n\nThe grey line is very near our current "oh fuck" zone.

Buy weekly calls up to $450 on red days. If it actually gets up there, buy Puts at $350 expiring in August.\n\nPositions: \n\nIf SPY hits 450-460 going into June I will spend all of my life savings on long dated OTM Puts so that I can feed myself during the recession.

I will continue to monitor and TA QQQ as I do believe  those hold correlation especially with tech being so heavy in SPY. \n\nLook when I said yesterday that there was a triple top at 430 and I expected us to dip today this is not quite what I had in mind… I mean I like being right but this was slightly overkill… I also played my most successful overnight lotto but managed to close it beyond early. Close for an 80% gain which granted that’s some killer profits on an over night lotto… end of day it was up at 500% before power hour. Does it hurt? Yea I mean a little but it hurts less then -100% so I got that going for me haha. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5jr3bue2rx81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c86651baa7438492d0b57792f42b80e0311c24ad\n\nIf you didn’t know there is a WIKI page with the large moves for SPY well we made Top 10 today and missed top 5 by 0.07%. \n\nNot gonna like the fact that SPY was down 3.8% but 1115am was beyond impressive and had broken -4% intraday before noon. This is one of the fastest and most aggressive intraday drops ive watched. I thought there COULD be a chance we get the circuit breaker today but that wasn’t in the paybook I guess… for now. \n\nThe thing that actually sucked the most about today was I went into the day bearish But in my head 420 was the max I thought we would drop. We had nearly blown through that before we even had the first candle of the day and then once we broke 418 I really was speechless. \n\nI always tell myself man I want a massive 4-5% day cause I know imma make bank but real talk the whole time you are in such disbelief that when you finally believe its already over. Especially today I mean it was so volatile and then one 11am came we pretty much traded flat all day with not a really big move to play. If you had an over night put and held you won. But for me I felt I kept playing against myself and pretty much just traded against myself winning one then losing one then winning one. Thankfully still netted 3x daily profits but not an ideal end to the day. \n\nSo where the heck are we now? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zb6rnwgf2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3565aa6f309f2d91b2bac9f3ff697faee9b3008a\n\nTriple Top confirmed… lets puts 430 in as a MASSIVE resistance to break now. I am actually gonna enhance the line size and color it blue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mznda9g2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0daadbded146272b5aab0b326f599178f41907d8\n\nSo we are obviously still well within the bear channel and now we are trading within the middle of the bear channel which means we could test resistance or we could test support again next. We have been slowly trading less bearish but this was a pretty big knock down. Currently support is at 405 à 390-400 (bottom of support depending on how fast we move) and resistance is at 424 (top of bear channel). After we break 424 we have 430 to deal with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfs9z0sg2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ae65727e55811bebc27c6fc7c7831f541aaf55b\n\nHere is the current daily with the three bear channels one longer term and the two shorter term. As I had mentioned yesterday we perfectly rejected off the 430 level for the resistance line and we had to gap down to maintain and boy did we. Now the question will be what do we do tomorrow? \n\nSo we reached an intraday low of 409.44 today but 412.32 was pretty much a magnet for us all day today and was clearly support. Once we broke that we hit 410.1 for a bit before we recovered end of day to 413.81. What I am seeing is that 411.7 is a major support now over the last two months. If you look at the Feb 24th candle we close at 410.64 (within in reason of a daily support), April 29th the low was 411.21, May 2nds candle body sit on the 411.7 line, and then today we saw a ton of support in that 411-412 range. I think we are seeing a major support forming here at this 410-412 level on the daily. Even look at the May 2nd candle that did hit 405.02 we close above the 410-412 level and saw a large recoil that day. \n\nMy theory is that’s our bottom for now. I think tomorrow we are going to see an inside range day which means we can trade anywhere between 425 and 410 tomorrow. \n\nMajor support levels at 411.8 à 405 à 402 à 395 (this is actually bottom of the broader bear channel we have been in since January) \n\nMajor resistance- 417 à 420 à 424 à 426 (current bear channels resistance line) à 428\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7zq0ybh2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f2033284968433b95652985519cbc30ed207358\n\nI don’t usually reference the daily chart unless its Friday but I think its important enough to share here. We have had four week in a row of red candles on the weekly chart. We have not done that since the 2020 crash. 412.07 is the weeklys open and as long as this candle closes ABOVE that we will see a green candle to snap the trend. I have a feeling that we are going to finish about that level tomorrow. I don’t think they are gonna give us the red day. As you can also see we bounced this week off the weekly 100ema at 406 and off the support line of this grey weekly channel. \n\nYou can also see the Feb 22nd  (wick) , April 25th and this week candles bodies are all sitting right on this 411 support range. I think this is our default support for now. \n\nI can see two maybe three scenarios for tomorrow\n\n1. We are going to say fuck it all and drill straight to the core and have another -4% red day and touch 395 to confirm support of not only short term bear channel but broader bear channel too. \n\n2. We are going to see a massive rally back above 425 \n\n3. We have a range day/ inside day like I mentioned. We could touch lower support of 405 but most likely would revert back up closer to 420 by EOD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9imnsgzh2rx81.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=591a5c29270951b8cf61a836fb481e0e5a0aadae\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6hcwzii2rx81.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d31cfdd716a5a2a51e265a5d904a5df9280b033\n\nSomething I was playing with earlier was looking at the April 21st to April 26th dip before we finally recovered. It ws about 7.4% of movement down. If we are assuming a similar top was in at 430 we could see about the same range… a roughly 7.4% move down would put us right at 400. Which is in range of tomorrow if we have another massive sell of. Just some food for thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uva5zs3j2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acb665e5139e8c6f52627559f443da641f346322\n\nNotice anything similar about the QQQ chart compared to SPY? Let me show you a little closer… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fpp636jj2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2854cbcf6a2df89a94248319ef92c34f670ccaa7\n\nYes that’s right you are seeing a double bottom on QQQ at its support of 310. Actually wildly enough the double bottom is within 3 cents of each other (May 2nd 309.65 and todays low of 309.62). That’s a pretty convincing double bottom to me. \n\nQQQ traded perfectly within this channel today.\n\nMajor supports- 310 à 301 (bottom of current red bear channel)\n\nMajor resistance- 318 à 324 à 327 (resistance line of bear channel)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wjo1op2k2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67937a450d7c9e82d00dc79179bfd50dc520000c\n\nThe VIX had a hella impressive day trading from its lows of 25.78 to its heights of 33.20. That’s a total 28.8% of movement upward today. The most impressive thing of it all is that when you look at the beginning of the day and pre market you NEVER would have suspected that. It just kept rising and refused to stop. IT was definitely interesting to watch unfold. Now the question is… why? What caused it. Wildly enough… this isn’t even top 10 biggest VIX spikes in one day… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jotoqmk2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d41e1c29fbfd19c9b56f9f48ba925637723d691f\n\nAight some of you are NOT gonna like this cause this is definitely TA-ing the VIX which I KNOW is a no-no… trust me its impossible BUT there is a pattern. And when I see a pattern imma share it. \n\nSo lets look back at the January/ February dip. We saw a massive spike to 39 à dip to 26.9 à another spike to 32.8 à recovered to lows near 20. \n\nMarch dip.. we saw a massive spike to 37.8 à relief down to 27 à another spike to 37.5 à unwound to 18.5\n\nSo our now April/ may dip… we saw a massive spike to 36.6 à relief down to 25 à another massive spike to 33.2 à will we see relief back down to low 20s?\n\nMy theory is yes we will. Now the timing on it is the tough one. The January peak day till it started to unwind was 5 days. March was 15 days. Currently we are at 4 with tomorrow being day 5. If you include the spike to 33.8 on April 26th we are at 8 days… \n\nSo while it MAY not happen tomorrow… there is a pretty strong case in the next week to two weeks max we should start a bull run. One could argue that markets are waiting for CPI Wednesday before doing so. But there is potential we could start that unwinding now. But looking at this there is a case to suspect we see VIX revisit 35-40 and SPY touch that 390-400 level first. \n\nSo really anything can happen tomorrow belief it or not… How am I playing it? I am playing it bullish for tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a good day I made 3x daily profits but I honestly felt like all I was doing all day was fighting myself. I erased just as much gains I had. Especially during that sideways window from 11 till power hour I kept fighting myself and not trusting myself.

I overall see limited downside tomorrow and next week so I will be rolling those tomorrow before market close, Overall not too worried about those. \n\nI closed out my 60dte put position this morning also (way too early)… the plan with that was to load up as we bull ran for an anticiapted drop. Well now the plan is to load up 30dte calls for a potential bull run this month. \n\nI opened this at 425 and averaged down a few times today. I don’t plan to average down again until we touch 405. I fat fingered my DCA this morning and instead of buying about 3 controls I bought 6 so that was not ideal and now this is a much larger long position then I planned for but sitting here I am looking pretty good. My breakeven for these are 415.2 so I mean we are looking pretty golden especially if we see that move back to 430-440 next week or rest of month. \n\nI also decided to open a 418C lotto at close of day I was able to close that for 10%. So I then opened a new 415C lotto for tomorrow. I feel fairly confident whether it be in the morning or all day that those will print. \n\nAnd my hyperwheel.

I ate all my crayons already and my wife's boyfriend only uses paint because he's sophisticated, so try to pay attention. \n\nWhat is it?\n\nHimax Technologies (HIMX) is a semiconductor company, provides display imaging processing technologies in China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Korea, Japan, Europe, and the United States. The company operates through two segments, Driver IC and Non-Driver Products. It offers display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers that are used in televisions, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, automotive, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality devices, and other consumer electronic devices.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nHIMX is scheduled to release their Q2 earnings pre-market on Thursday, May 12. Expected earnings are about $0.70 and HIMX set their range fro .67-.73. Given that they have a proven track record of beating expectations, I highly suspect the earnings results to come in around $0.75. During Q1, HIMX had a return on equity of 64.29% and a net margin of 28.24%. They also had revenue of $451.90 million during the quarter. These are all good signs. \nThe company has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.05, a fifty-two week low of $8.53 and a fifty-two week high of $17.30. The stock has a 50 day moving average price of $10.36 and a two-hundred day moving average price of $10.96. Their market capitalization sits at around $1.66 billion, and a P/E ratio of 3.80. More good signs.\nThe company's revenue shot up 74% in 2021 to $1.55 billion, while gross margin increased to a record 48.5% from 24.9% in 2020. \n\nHere's the kicker, HIMX has a 5Y beta value of 2.01!\nFor all you retards that have read this far and don't know what that means: Beta is a measure of risk commonly used to compare volatility The S&amp;P 500 Index is the base for calculating beta with a value of 1.0. Securities with betas below 1 have historically been less volatile than the market. While securities with betas above 1, have historically been more volatile than the market. The beta is calculated using data over a 5-year period. Just for comparison purposes Apple's beta is 1.19 and Tesla is 2.11. \n\nWhat do the big boys think?\nA number of hedge funds have recently built up their holdings of HIMX. Morgan Stanley grew its stake in Himax Technologies by 243.6% in the second quarter. Marshall Wace LLP bought a new stake in Himax Technologies in the fourth quarter worth $4,830,000. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. boosted its holdings in Himax Technologies by 293.2% in the fourth quarter and acquired an additional 217,129 shares in the last quarter. State Street Corp boosted its holdings in Himax Technologies by 17.1% in the fourth quarter. Finally, BlackRock Inc. boosted its holdings in Himax Technologies by 59.3% in the fourth quarter. 26.96% of the stock is currently owned by institutional investors.\n\nHIMX has a price target set at $11 by Nomura. This tells me that the current price, just like the rest of the market, is on sale. Right now, HIMX is trading at just\xa03.5 times trailing earnings and 0.99 times sales. So right now looks like a no-brainer, even for a bunch of retards. Their rapid growth should be sustainable for a long time to come, as it is serving several fast-growing markets - TVs, smartphones, notebooks, tablets, automotive touchscreens, and virtual reality devices.\n\nWhat to do?\nI don't care.

NFLX 182.5 C 5/6'), ('Nasdaq on ~11000 fair value eoy 2022', "Nasdaq on ~11000 fair value eoy 2022Hi guys,\n\nFed: 2,5% + 1,5% of your broker means 4%\n\nFor taking the risk I want 3%\n\nMeans I want companies with PE ratio of 14 max.\n\nLook at the S&amp;P and Nas and calculate the correction.\n\nI am analyzing the market for quite a while. What people await is a big relief rally, which will not happen in near future. The reasons are as mentioned: Most S&amp;P 500 companies, e.g. lets pick the biggest one: AAPL (Apple) has a PE of about 24/25 now. This means:\n\nI invest 100$ for a company, which has an expected earning of 4$. The expected growth is lets say 10% per year. This means, that Apple will earn 4.40$ next year, and 6.44$ in 5 years per share (4$ * 1.15 = 6.44$). Which means, that the company will have earning per share of 6.44%in 5 years or a PE ratio of (1/0,0644) = 15,52 in 5 years.\n\nOnce Apple projects a growth rate less than 10%, lets assume: 3% or no grwoth (recession, caused by upcoming rate hikes, FED tries to slow down economy,..) --&gt; This stock will find it's fair value by a projected PE ratio of max. 15 in 5-years. These are dummy numbers to show my way of thinking.\n\nThe second big, more important issue is the perspective of investors: - So I get 3% for a Treasuries now. Which means following: I can invest 10,000$ in a Treasury Bond and will get 300$ every year for next 10/20 years. I dont mean TLT by this. TLT is more the reverse of this. - I get 7-9% for Emerging Markets Govt Bonds (e.g. Turkey) with a duration of 10-20 years. Noted in USD. - FED will incerease the fund rate to lets say 2.5%. Which means for an investor: --&gt; Pay 2.5% + Interest charge of broker (1-1.5%). So if I go for a margin account, I pay 4% upfront when going on leverage. So the question for me here is: Can I expect 4% growth in stock value when going on margin? Which would be the break-even-point for going on margin AND the american stock market is full of margin. I should pick some stats to show this. But you guys can research here.. So I ask myself: Better on margin or cash? Why on margin, when I should pay 4% interest for holding a stock? None of the tech or S&amp;P stocks do have a PE and expected growth which legitimates the attempt to go on margin in near future (assuming that fed funds rate will be at least on 2.25 or 2.50 by end of this year of next year beginning).\n\n3rd big issue is the fact that FED will reduce the balance sheet. This will lead to another increase in Bond Yields. So the investor will ask himself: - Why risk capital on Apple, which has a PE ratio of 25, not extreme growth per share and low payout when I can own a treasury bond with a yield of 4% guaranteed for next 10-20 years? - So the investor wants a risk premium of at least 3% (this is also a historic amount). You can check and compare the difference between PE ratio of S&amp;P 500 and the treasury yields and will see that there is difference of 3% on average over past decades. - Which means following: The investor wants a 6% earnings per share now (treasury yields are at 3% now). And investor will likely to see 7% earnings when treasury yields jump to 4% (assuming this will happen within 6-12 months).\n\nYou can see the reaction in the stock market. Every time we think there is a relief rally we see big sell-off instantly. Big players are off. The Nasdaq plunged back to 6,000 in 2018/19 when FED was talking about almost no issues compared to now. I do not know the companies back then in detail and haven't researched any detail yet but there is one thing I can tell you guys: - These fucking points have no meaning. The fundametals of the companies within the index matter. From what I see now I can tell clearly that we are on the right path. We need 30% from now to rearch the All time highs again. The only scenario where this can happen in near future is: - Inflation gets back to 2% in 2024 - Interest rates get back to 2021 level in 2024 - China stops fucking up Supply Chains. - Companies will have stable earnings and growth\n\nIf these things do not happen then the only way we see all time highs is: - Companies will have growth but slower than 2021 or before that time. We will still see the all time highs but it may take us 7 or more years. Interest rates are major factor here.\n\nI would say the Nasdaq will see something like 11000 before jumping back. After seeing job market data is still perfect yesterday, we cannot await any step back from FED. But lets see inflation data next week"), ('First ever 0DTE went pretty well.

Nvidia’s gaming revenue increased by 52% year over year during the second quarter of 2018 and by 25% for the third quarter of that year. During the relevant period, some of the company’s sales personnel expressed their belief that rising demand for the company’s gaming products, especially in China, was driven by crypt0mining, but Nvidia failed to disclose the information to investors, the SEC said.\n\n&gt; The omission was misleading because the company made statements about how other business segments were impacted by crypt0currency demand, creating the impression that gaming business was isolated from crypt0 impacts, the SEC added.\n\n&gt; “Nvidia’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC enforcement division’s crypt0 assets and cyber unit.\n\n&gt; Shares of Nvidia were down 0.2% to $187.90 on Friday.

As demand for and interest in crypt0 rose in 2017, NVIDIA customers increasingly used its gaming GPUs for crypt0mining.\n\n&gt; In two of its Forms 10-Q for its fiscal year 2018, NVIDIA reported material growth in revenue within its gaming business. NVIDIA had information, however, that this increase in gaming sales was driven in significant part by crypt0mining. Despite this, NVIDIA did not disclose in its Forms 10-Q, as it was required to do, these significant earnings and cash flow fluctuations related to a volatile business for investors to ascertain the likelihood that past performance was indicative of future performance. The SEC’s order also finds that NVIDIA’s omissions of material information about the growth of its gaming business were misleading given that NVIDIA did make statements about how other parts of the company’s business were driven by demand for crypt0, creating the impression that the company’s gaming business was not significantly affected by crypt0mining.\n\n&gt; “NVIDIA’s disclosure failures deprived investors of critical information to evaluate the company’s business in a key market,” said Kristina Littman, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s crypt0 Assets and Cyber Unit. “All issuers, including those that pursue opportunities involving emerging technology, must ensure that their disclosures are timely, complete, and accurate.”\n\n&gt; The SEC’s order finds that NVIDIA violated Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the disclosure provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The order also finds that NVIDIA failed to maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, NVIDIA agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay a $5.5 million penalty.\n\n&gt; The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Brent Wilner of the crypt0 Assets and Cyber Unit, and supervised by Diana Tani and Ms. Littman of the crypt0 Assets and Cyber Unit.\n\nSource https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-79'), ('MSFT people doing microsoft-y things', 'MSFT people doing microsoft-y things')], '2022-05-08': [('How do I short almonds?', 'How do I short almonds?I usually stick to SPY puts, but I read a news article that said the CA drought will be awful this year and I drove across the state recently and the whole fucking thing is almonds, so I want to short almonds.

Kinda like SPY the pretty lines might suggest we go down to around 300, and that might be a good level to buy at.   \n\n\n[IWM 3y](https://preview.redd.it/urw5183ooby81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3037e6fc6fbfb5c14f9939f0352b74f11523aac5)\n\n* IWM got well under 190 this week, and that 190-192 range has been a kind of support on the lower end of this range. This is such a good chart to showcase how sideways large parts of this market have been for the last year.\n* IWM had that failed breakout in November which really marked the start of this downturn. I\'m personally not bullish on anything until IWM starts to bottom and participates in rallies - it didn\'t really participate in that March rally and I thought that was really telling at the time.  \n\n\n[RUA 3y](https://preview.redd.it/dw5ayd13pby81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5627e9897f7043fc5b0fb3d737f2ce32f3267e87)\n\n \n\n* Lastly, looking at the RUA - the Russel 3000 / virtually the entire US stock market, it closed under that 2400 level, so could see lower here, but...\n\nOverall, seems like we\'re close to some levels that could be major support, and we\'re relatively oversold, sentiment is super bearish... Idk I have to wonder if we\'ll just chop around down here a bit. I don\'t get any real conviction that we\'ll get that last flush we\'ve been looking for based on these charts, but these aren\'t a crystal ball...\n\nLastly here I want to talk about the price action this week: Monday / Tuesday really felt like markets were just anxious waiting for the FOMC announcement. Wednesday that huge rally I think was all purely positioning: hedges put in place for any surprise, and when the even passed all that IV rolled off and we had a gamma-squeeze-type rally, right up to some key levels in the indices. Thursday there was a bit of talk about some fund getting liquidated, who knows, but I think it regardless it was just a reset to real prices. Did seem to have some aggressive selling Thursday, but I wouldn\'t give too much attention to the price action day-to-day last week.   \nMoving on... \n\n#  Sectors\n\n[Sector Performance, 1y](https://preview.redd.it/sr88ca2pz1y81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8aa77ed13d6dccc66b8f76ab7a15c6777f5b1212)\n\n* This is a pretty busy, but handy chart I look at to give me an idea of relative performance across many market sectors. It\'s been useful the last few years as we\'ve had a ton of rotation between different areas of the market, and this can help me spot that and trade momentum accordingly.\n* We can really see the outperformance of "energy" via the XLE here; in previous posts I pointed out the relative outperformance of defensive sectors e.g. IYH so far this year, now we\'re starting to see those roll over just like everything else...  \n\n\n[XLU 1y](https://preview.redd.it/wofmpak302y81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50504946322145119122b937e69467e362c6dc94)\n\n* I think industrials and to a lesser extent utilities are a good point of reference for how the market feels about the economy. XLU seemed to catch a bid as a defensive play even though these stocks generally underperform in a rising-rate environment. We\'ve now seen that come back in, and it\'s established some kind of support around the top of it\'s previous range. Will be interesting to see if this breaks down further...  \n\n\n[XLI, 5y](https://preview.redd.it/7p50guwj02y81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb27681f929c05ab47eed92a2c3f95bf5e51f8be)\n\n* Zooming out a bit on the industrials, we\'re now at the bottom or even slightly below the range established early in 2021 - we top out here right around the same time we topped out almost everywhere else and started to see stocks move lower (yes all this started about a year ago). \n* The performance of industrials over the last year has really been indicative of what\'s been going on in the broad market, even if the major indices were making new highs.\n\n# Bonds, Dollar, Sentiment\n\n[DXY, all-time](https://preview.redd.it/39sd1vfl12y81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d47183f87e7ef23d3aa4799b26de2a0c06c6adbc)\n\n* I\'ve been highlighting the US Dollar index over the last few posts and it continues to be a major consideration for me. I think this is more important to the outlook than the move in bonds, and as long as it\'s making new highs I think that\'s a headwind for US stocks.   \nThe DXY is a measure of the US dollar against a basket of other currencies, though the Euro makes up the largest portion. \n* The dollar going up is not great for US companies, especially those that get significant revenues from outside the US. It\'s also not great for [all sorts of trades](https://www.investopedia.com/carry-trade-definition-4682656) that can start to blow up as we make a historical move...\n* I\'m gonna leave this section short - not much else has changed here, though maybe the notable move in the US10Y above 3%, which maybe was a line in the sand that we broke through rather easily post-FOMC. Some real historic moves in the bond market as of late.\n\n# Consider This\n\nBear or Bull, I wanted to put down some points that I believe you need to keep in mind:\n\n* Though not the first time since the GFC, the Fed is changing it\'s behavior by halting QE, raising rates, and starting QT (balance sheet runoff), but *this time* it has to commit to these actions until inflation comes down. Previous episodes saw the Fed reverse course due to market sentiment / market dynamics (Taper Tantrum, 2018). We\'re looking at a completely different set of circumstances here, a complete change in market dynamics. \n* Global-wise, the picture is not great. Europe is facing a recession, China still can\'t deal with Covid and is prolonging supply chain issues in doing so, Russia is trying to reassert itself as a world power. Many emerging market countries are facing inflationary pressures and debt issues, some of these are very close to default. De-globalization is a thing. \n* For the time being, the US dollar and economy is strong. I see some rumblings in the VC/tech landscape that worry me, but by and large it seems like we\'re doing well, and positioned to continue to do so even if the rest of the world is having major issues. \n\n# Bonus: Stocks Come Full Circle\n\n**definition:** *through a series of developments that lead back to the original source, position, or situation or to a complete reversal of the original position* \n\nJust as a bonus, we\'ve now seen a lot of stocks retrace those pandemic market highs and I wanted to highlight a few because it really is just amazing the *magnitude* of the moves in these, both up and down:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[PYPL 5y](https://preview.redd.it/4f792dxpw1y81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dd51c966f9dacb1c220644b7f6018050a821335)\n\n[SHOP 5y](https://preview.redd.it/sqy4s286x1y81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=899a4bb85db9b177638827530d5258591ff2d8bd)\n\n[AMZN 5y](https://preview.redd.it/683422m7x1y81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=536c2dcc67d900f0e2e427d642112ffda5e5e472)\n\n[ROKU 5y](https://preview.redd.it/ucld2ev8x1y81.png?width=2474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f53fc6fde90d5eee98629246e1b90b8abc36f06)'), ('SPY CALLS Monday!', 'SPY CALLS Monday!'), ('Thoughts on AMZN?

If you\'re just gonna autistically screech on your keyboard because I mentioned an unmentionable, do yourself a favor and really flesh it out so you can at least harvest some internet points to make up for all the money you lost this past week.\n\nI don\'t have the patience nor intellectual capacity to link a bunch of fancy charts and TA so maybe you\'ll actually read through this entire post instead of falling for another bot pump and dump thinking to yourself "wow this guy seems professional, fuck it I\'ll YOLO."\n\nHere are the key highlights for their Q1 2022 earnings today:\n\nAfter a huge fall from grace CLOV is currently sitting on a $1.27 billion market cap. At just $2.79 right now, you couldn\'t even exchange a share for a 10 piece at Wendy\'s but don\'t worry, Burger King offers 8 shitty nuggets for just $1 so all the bagholders won\'t go hungry - for now.\n\nQ1 EPS: (0.16) vs (0.25 expected) (parentheses means negative because throwing a minus sign in front of a figure looks bad)\n\nQ1 Revenue: $874M. That is not a typo. $874 MILLION dollars in ONE quarter for a company with a $1.27B market cap. That is a 437% increase from Q1 2021 revenue of $200M. Not to mention Clover Assistant SaaS as another potential revenue stream. I can already hear the doubters: "But OG\\_ClapCheekz69, revenue doesn\'t mean shit in this market if it\'s hemorrhaging cash." And that is a fair point, which brings me to my next.\n\nQ1 Net Loss: $75 Million. At this rate, CLOV is burning $300M a year. Terrifying right? Well, in a stroke of sheer genius/autism CLOV management paid a local fortune teller $5 and she told the interim CFO (who needs a real CFO anyways) to really fuck the shareholders and do an offering back in November, before the market went to complete shit. Thanks to gypsy magic, CLOV is now sitting on around $700M cash/assets and with no adjustments, they\'ll be able to keep the lights on for at least 2.5 more years. Not to mention, the health care sector is recession and inflation proof - people will need medicare and their doctors no matter how the economy and markets are doing.\n\nHere\'s the real meat and potatoes:\n\nMedicare Advantage Medical Care Ratio (MCR): 96.4%\n\nDirect Contracting MCR: 99.8%\n\nWhat is MCR? Hopefully someone in the comments will explain it better than I can, but basically if it weren\'t for minor details /s like salaries, operating costs, etc. CLOV would be netting positive right now. Why is this a highlight? This is the first quarter that CLOV had a sub 100% MCR which is a HUGE indicator that they are progressing smoothly down the path to profitability. Not to mention, it gives them street cred and helps bump up their CMS rating (which I guess is like Yelp for insurance). They currently have a CMS rating of 3.5 stars, but I\'ve been told that 4 is where the magic happens, and with everything going on that can be expected in 2023-2024.\n\nTo wrap things up, CLOV management has all but promised profitability by 2023. Industry average for profitable companies is 3x annual revenue, which would put CLOV at a $12B market cap or share price of around $25 for a 10 bagger.

Inflation is starting to cause issues everywhere across the world, seriously this is happening everywhere.

This is gone now, yesterday India just shut off all wheat exports to save it for their own citizens.  Inflation is accelerating at dangerous levels when the global economy is slowing.  I think that a 100bp rate hike is necessary but Jerome Powell does not have the guts to do that.  By the June meeting, a 75bp rate hike will be expected.\n\n The global economy is getting worse and worse.  I expect stocks to rebound this week though.  The bond market finally reached this trend line which has indicated every other past recession.  Usually, there is one final rally after the bond market tops though.  The market definitely will not reach near all-time highs but at this point, a bear market rally is extremely likely.  \n\nI still believe there will be a huge panic sell but that day is for sure not next week.

First, I was looking at $COIN option chain, june 10th strikes, looking to sell a call credit spread with each leg with a delta around 0.30. So I look at selling the 90c and buying the 95c. The credit is $40 with a max loss of $460, profit/risk profile of 0.087. \n\nFor fun, I decide to see how the profit/risk profile differed for similar delta on $SPY. So, same expiration, very similar delta of 0.30, I look at selling the 117c and buying the 117.5c, which yields a credit of $10 and a max loss of $40, profit/risk profile of 0.25.\n\nI go, “wow!! So much better! The same ‘probability of profitability’ but with a better risk reward setup”.\nBut then I go, “wait, that’s bullshit, that doesn’t make sense. And that old ‘delta equals probability of profitability’ trope isn’t right, delta just measures option price sensitivity to underlying price movement.”\n\nI’m also thinking, this doesn’t look right just in terms of %change required to reach max loss. For $SPY it is a 3.93% move, and for $COIN it is a 39.97% move!!! Basically 10x. \n\nSo I go, hmmmm this must be due to IV, right? So I look it up and $SPY IV was 26.9, and $COIN IV was 148.2, only 5.51x. \n\nSo now I’m a little stumped… If the IV is only 5x, why is the %change in the underlying 10x? How is the ‘probability of success’ as so many misname it, the same, but the $SPY play is seemingly much riskier, with a better risk/reward to match?\n\nHow do you interpret all this?

This market is like trading on expert mode in a foreign language. We are seeing things that should not even be possible happening intraday and the market being able to go up 1% in 15 minutes and back down 1.5% in the next 15 minutes. We are living in some wild times right now and we just need to take the small wins and just keep our heads above the water until we finally hopefully by next year return to a more normal market that’s not so irrational. \n\nI feel like almost daily I hear someone say something along the lines of “you seem hesitant to enter on a clear trend” or “I don’t understand why we aren’t playing puts/ calls here?” or “you seem like you aren’t following your own strategy” or “I feel like you are taking too many trades or too many risks now.”\n\nI wanted to take a second to address this. Here is a screen shot from Thursday May 12th intraday trading session. As you can see below this particular day had 6 full 180 reversals and quite a few of $5-7 dollar movements within 30 minutes of trading. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0n8zcd1jfjz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25fcfdc782814eebf6a1525ee518b0404ab73a87\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gmp3lmjfjz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3026c2f2d329d8bfaa6dcb14d4cb32c70b750da\n\nNow here is a screenshot of December 20th and December 21st. Do you notice the difference? On the 20th and 21st we see spy open and steadily ride the 8ema down, find support, cross back over the 8ema and ride that into the EOD. No reversals, no $5 swings, no $3 candles, none of this current market fuckery. Now this is just a random day in time I chose. But choose any day even a bear day from December 2021 and prior and they all look pretty much just like this. \n\nThe market was on 100% easy mode I mean literally anyone coulda woke up and said… hmm SPY is up 0.2% pre market I think I will buy a 0dte call and hold for the day and by EOD that person probably would be sitting on a 100%+ gain. \n\nThat market is long and gone. I wont say its gone for forever because I know some day, when idk, but someday that market is going to return. I would like nothing more than to have the year of 2021 to trade again. You litereally had to try and make money. There was no need for the 10% challenge, there was no need for doing 20 trades a day to scalp profits. You bought, held and won every single day. Day trading was not a skill it was just easy. \n\nNow you have to trade with a sense of purpose, emotionless, and calculated risk and reward. We are seeing SPY following the 8ema upward looking as bullish as we can be with volume, VIX and every other indicator pointing to bullish. And then the next candle opens and we are seeing SPY literally do a 1% sell off. Only for the next candle to open and go back up 1.25%. \n\nWe are having to decide whether we are seeing a true reversal or whether we are seeing a rest and continuation of trend. Up until about March I was saying constantly how any rest (as in say SPY goes up 1.5% and the drops back to 1%) as a buying opportunity. Because almost 99% of the time SPY would then EOD make a new high of day. However, now we are having to decide when we see even the smallest red candle on whether we take profits if we are green or immediately take a loss if we are in the red. We have to decide in pretty much 1 second whether we are going to hold through the red or whether we are going to cut our losses and look to re-enter. \n\nI speak from experience and everyone on my discord or those who follow my night TA can see that I am very transparent whether I win or loss. Im not here to say look at my I have a 100% success rate and I NEVER lose. I am here to be raw, real and essentially vulnerable with you guys. \n\nI have seen in my chats lately quite a few guys saying things like im down 30% portfolio today or this week. Or im down 90% on these calls or whatever else. I hate seeing those things. I am not here to tell you guys you are even doing anything wrong I am here to take a second to hopefully help clear a few things up and also to give a few tips to help survive this environment. For those of you who are trading and just doing this for fun and truly don’t care about the gains or losses then you can stop reading here lol. But for those who the losses hurt or this is not money you can lose (you really shouldn’t be trading with it then but I get it). I really recommend everyone right now ½ their position sizes. So if you are attempting to trade with $1000 per trade then you need to drop down to $500 per trade. \n\nWhy would I want you to do that? Because when we catch these reversals sometimes by time we can even sit there and thing is this real or is this a fake out our trades already down 50%+. We need the extra ammo on the sidelines to re-enter trades. \n\nMy motto is always 10% per trade and never let a green trade go red. This environment is even more important for that. If you are in a trade that’s going green and you are even 1% green and you see that trade stall. By stall I mean price action is either bouncing between a $1 range or literally looks frozen you need to exit that trade immediately. You are more likely than not about to see a massive reversal. I find myself more and more in this environment entering a trade on a run and seeing it pause the exiting with 5-10% gains. \n\nYou can ALWAYS re-enter a trade (unless you are out of BP I guess) but you can NOT always get back you profits or minimize a loss. With this current environment and especially when we are trading over VIX 30 you have to “live to trade another day”. I have preached since day one that day trading options full time is NOT a race it 100% is a marathon. You have about 250 trading days per year. You do not need to make 10k per day. \n\nI tell everyone to figure out what they want to make per year day trading and divide that by 250 when they first ask me about what their daily profit goal should be. So for me… my daily profit goal is only $500. Now of course id say almost every day I beat that goal (of course somedays I miss that by a lot too). The one thing that I have seen myself struggle with over the last two week specifically is making 3-4 great trades in the first hour that put me up 3-5x my daily profit goal only to erase all those gains from 11am to 2pm and have to fight back the last 2 hours to end green again. \n\nWe HAVE to be patient and we HAVE to be fast and quick on our trades. If you are right get your profit set a trailing stop loss and don’t EVER touch it. For me I open a trade and IMMEDIATLEY open a MARKET sell order so that if things go south quickly I am two fast taps on my phone away from exiting. Once I get to 10% gains I will usually throw a 5% trailing stop on so that I KNOW I 100% will NOT exit this trade red. If I really think I got a runner and might see some volatility I will cut back my trailing stop to 10%. BUT when I have my trailing stop open I do a cancel/ replace MARKET open qued ready to go so that if I see price action stall or I am at a great profit spot (usually 25%+ for me) I will lock that profits in. \n\nBut on the flip side IF your trade immediately goes against you we HAVE to be emotionless and willing to cut losses quickly and early. Don’t second guess yourself on a -10% or even -20% loser and let it become a -50% loser cause you couldn’t cut it. Current market conditions make this right here the HARDEST part of trading. Being confident in a position and closing it red to protect yourself from further downside only to watch it be a fake out and it rip back green is the biggest mind fuck out there… because the next time you let the loser run you know 100% that its going to -99% and never coming back. You have to live in the PRESENT and think ONLY about the CURRENT trade do not let past mistakes or experiences hinder your thinking. \n\nIn the end guys we are already trading one of the most risky investments and there are not many of us out there that are consistently successful. This market makes it about 1000x harder than it is usually too. Don’t beat yourself up. Also a new rule I have is that if I make two trades in a row that go red that I take a step back and say okay im not seeing something right here and usually I will wait about an hour before I re-enter so I have time to really visualize things. This market will chew you up and spit you out faster then you can hit sell. \n\nI love this community we have built guys and truly do not want to see anyone lose anymore money than they already have. I too have lost plenty of money over the years. I promise you if you can mitigate losses, capitalize on winners and keep your head above water till this crash/ correction is over with you will some day be a 1000x better trader and will have more tools to be nimble in different environments than you ever did before. \n\nIf you guys ever need anything or need help please reach out to me before you capitulate for good.'), ('Largest U.S. Pension Bought AMC, AMD, and Block Stock.

The Model 3, Model S and Model Y will all need heavy updates, and they're still only covering 3 market segments. There are only so many vehicles they can sell from this range before they saturate the markets they operate in. Model X sales are by and large too small to be relevant.

There's little doubt that they could run robotaxi demo services on a small scale, much in the same way that many other companies are doing. But any thoughts of widescale true autonomy in the next 10 years are unrealistic. And when that does happen, it is far from a two horse, GM vs Tesla, race. There are dozens of [companies](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/) actively testing autonomous technology.\n\nAnd then there are inflation issues (wage inflation as well as raw material prices), along with recession risks. These two combined could very quickly erode their profitability. Rapidly increasing offerings from other OEMs, operating at far lower price points, will also limit Tesla's maximum market share.\n\nThat's not to take anything away from them The jobs the staff there have done to bring products to market has been astounding, and the company truly deserves their place in the market.

No way I will use it for work, etc , like ever. FB also never created the idea of metaverse, they simply just tried to take credit for it all. Also the amount of investment will be a money pit especially with little ways to monetize. Theres also competition for metaverse and social media platform competition like tiktok. However im neutral on tiktok because it could fade away in a year or 2. But losing users for META was due to competition, however the user numbers are returning with global market reach and can continue up, we will Have to keep track to ensure META isn’t continuously losing users Quarter by quarter. \n\nMissing on earnings Q4: we did see META beat earnings Q1FY22 so back to business for them! Layoffs also help cut expenses. Net income did fall, which im thinking metaverse bs R&amp;D skewing operational expenses. Meta’s advertising revenue in Q1 2022 still grew by 6% YoY to $27bn despite Apple headwinds. \n\nIOS privacy issue per COO is focused on:\n1) Growing video monetisation, especially short-form video-like reels 2) Evolving Meta’s ad systems to do more with less data 3) Investing in AI and machine learning to support our ads infrastructure\n\nOVERALL: bullish\n\nReasons:\n1) META will overcome privacy issues dealing with IOS\n2) User growth will show strength in next earnings as fad social media platforms dissipate\n3) earnings will be beat next quarters\n4) someone internal will tell Mark Z to stick to stealing people’s ideas instead of trying to come up with his own and hopefully pull plug on excessive spending on Metaverse \n5) P/E of 15 = undervalued \n6) Michael Burry bought shares at $222, and he is the ultimate 🐻 \n7) META is not disappearing anytime soon\n8) find new ways to monetize all their holdings like Whatsapp\n9) FAANG apes 🦍 strong\n\nPositions: 300 shares at $201.58\n$10k of cash set aside for call options (not opened yet).

The 15min and the 5min have both been riding the 8ema downward since about 230pm when we saw a huge rejection at 403.97 for the intraday high. Black channel resistance is 401.6. \n\nI am looking for over night to see SPY break this 398.5 support and test 396.1 near open. There is a chance we could see spy hold 398.5 and test 404.3 channel resistance (purple) at open but my guess being that the bulls were unable to follow through today and with Jpow speaking tomorrow is that we will see a fairly red open somewhere between that 398.5 and 396.1 range. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kchvrhg3hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68606e15c9243609c88ea99326ddac8c8ec2ec03\n\nDaily chart you can see we closed a daily doji today which after an attempted breakout and recovery from 385 bounce Thursday that is not a very good finish. While I expected us to follow through and touch 412 (red channel resistance) it looks like we are very well may head back down for another grey channel support line test near 382 this week. Today the bulls also once again failed to break the daily 8ema which is also another bearish indicator when it was so easily in their grasps. \n\nWe have also seen a dramatic decrease in volume over the last week. We haven’t seen volume this low since April 20th which was the day before a massive dump. \n\nIf we are able to get a bullish day tomorrow 405.2 is going to be the major hurdle to get over and most likely will act in a similar manner 430 resistance did. \n\nWe are also looking at a 404 double top with May 11ths candle\n\nAs you can see the bearish momentum and indications are continuing to add up.\n\nMajor daily supports- 398.2 à 392.9 à 385.4\n\nMajor daily resistance- 402.5 (daily 8ema) à 405.2 à 411 (red channel resistance)\n\nKeep in mind weekly support is 380 and weekly resistance is 445.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0p7pt794hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=438555f2d7688b71c6e6526dc13e465560942954\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwa93no4hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87257b66bc53941571c1a7c4c9ebef4bb3f5c421\n\nSome interesting fed stuff going on tomorrow… JPOW at a future of everything festival?

Plenty of thinks to make the market freak out for sure. Which very well could be why we got a chop range day today. \n\nWe have notable earnings in the morning too from Walmart. Depending on what Walmart posts and more importantly their overall guidance will be interesting to note on how overall consumer is doing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0iavfxe5hxz81.png?width=897&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c83af8826b63459073044bf5b75c64b5db09b291\n\nLastly we can take a look at the VIX… the VIX actually had a pretty massive day today opening near 30.23 and reaching 27.36 at its lows… that’s a drop of nearly $3 or 10% while SPY had a red day. That’s a very important thing to note. In general its not a perfect correlation but if the VIX is dropping and SPY is having a red day that means overall the market is agreeing in the bearish movement and is no scared by the bearish movement. That’s something I mentioned last week that occurred a few times. \n\nThe other thing to note about the VIX is that the last time we saw a big drop like this in the VIX to this level we had a huge recoil the following day back over 30. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0rsrr226hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d547c1fbb30b8e690d1335a12bdc240be4a0d26f\n\nActually now that I see it that has happened two different times. Once on May 4th (FOMC meeting when we rallied to 430 then dumped the next day) and then once on April 25th we closed very close to this same level. So it looks like April 25th was a 0.58% green day that closed at 428.51 and was followed up by a -2.9% red day that closed at 416.1. So that will be something interesting to watch over night. We very well could see the same outcome. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nThese range, chop, theta burning reversal on reversal days are wrecking havocing on my lately. I feel like no matter how much we try they are truly just unplayable. This pretty much is a scalping market and cut your loses early kinda market.

But the 0dte for -32% and the -44% 2dte puts did the most damage today.

I expect based on the fact that bulls failed to capitalize on what shoulda been an easy softball pitch to 412 resistance today that we are in store for more downside. I also am banking on a pop in the VIX overnight with all the feds speaking and JPOW and will be holding this in hope of another big dump.

I do want to discuss a bubble though that looks primed to pop, potentially very soon.\n\n**Homes: Why are they an investment?**\n\nI’ll keep this section brief. There will always be demand for homes because there is a naturally limited supply. Homes values are artificially and intentionally propped up by city governments for their own sake, as well as current home owners. By limiting the number of homes that can be built far below the demand current home owners see a huge surge in value. During the covid pandemic this became significantly worse as demand spiked. People simply didn’t want to live in a small apartment when they weren’t allowed to leave. This created even further, cascading demand as FOMO (fear of missing out) buying happened. “If I don’t get this house now it will be up 50% by next year!”. This resulted in national home prices jumping 10.4% since in 2020 and 18.8% in 2021 [1].\n\n**How do people buy homes in this environment?**\n\nSo for the wealthy this may not be an issue. When bidding against first time buyers you have a far better chance of winning out due to a myriad of factors (lower loan rates, ability to take out a larger mortgage loan, etc). However, we saw a huge number of houses being offered over-value, in cash. There are a lot of wealthy people who can buy a house, but not many have the liquid fiat to front the entire cost of 300K-700K home (these are just common prices I see in Texas). So where is the cash coming from? A decent number of buyers (I cant find exact numbers, anyone know?) have been purchasing their houses, or at least taking care of the down payment, using margin loans. How does it work? If you are looking to purchase a house and own X dollars of investments in the stock market (bonds and listed companies) you can get a corresponding loan for Y dollars. The exact value of Y differs but it maxes out at 50% of X [2].\n\n**So, what’s the problem?**\n\nTaking out a loan on margin makes perfect sense as long as stock prices always go up. However, that’s not always the case as 2022 has proven. Over the last year, but especially the last few weeks, the stock market has taken a heavy beating. Since the start of 2022 the S&amp;P 500 has dipped in value by 18.68%, with a drop of 12.53% over the last few days [3]. This isn’t great but, isn’t necessarily a disaster as many saw a market correction as necessary to reign in Wall Street to economic realities that “Main Street” is facing. This drop is due to a myriad of factors, but is mostly based on historically high inflation that’s not going away as soon as expected. With the war in Ukraine raging and large swaths of China in a complete shutdown it’s unclear when supply chains will heal and inflation mostly driven down. The situation is so bad, in fact, that many institutions and top economists are warning of a stagflationary period [4&amp;5], if not a full recession [6]. For many it’s no longer a question of whether a recession will happen, but how painful it will be.But what about our home buyers on margin? This is the important part. If your margin loan falls a certain % chosen by the lender then you will be margin called. A margin call for a house is simple, you must increase the assets in your margin account back to the % or face liquidation to make it back up. If the underlying collateral assets can’t make up the % change, then your home may be foreclosed by the lender. To avoid this consumers could historically take out a low interest loan to refill their margin account, but high interest rates make this either impossible or incredibly foolish.\n\n**What could happen**\n\nI’ll lay out a doomsday scenario. If two things continue we are almost guaranteed a housing bubble burst: continued high inflation and the stock market continuing to dip. As long as inflation continues the average US household will continue to see their wealth decrease, resulting in lower consumer spending. Low consumer spending translates into negative returns on stocks. For home owners who buy on margin this creates an incredibly precarious situation. Not only is their margin account bleeding out, but their real wealth is decreasing, lowering the chance that they have the funds necessary to avoid a margin call. This is where things go nuclear: if homeowners assets are liquidated then the market itself is conversely hurt. Even though a $50k sell off of something like $SPY won’t make any measurable dent in a market, it creates a cascading effect. As stocks go lower homeowners are liquidated, with each liquidation driving stock prices down further. If a spiral like this starts very little can stop it when it hits critical mass. As the bubble bursts a massive sell off begins to cover home loans and real estate investments, etc. This then tanks the full economy. Homeowners with regular mortgages may not be able to continue paying if they lose their job or their home enters negative equity.\n\n**The Final Nail**\n\nThe average US household is in massive debt. This debt is primarily housing debt, coming in at a mind boggling $11.3 trillion [7]. This doesn’t include the $4.34 trillion in non-housing debt. To further add fuel to the fire: auto loans comprise almost $1.5 trillion of this, matching growth we’ve seen in housing. For borrowers who recently bought a car and may use it as collateral, your value is already eroding. Although prices are still historically high for used cars they’re dropping [8]. The plain truth is that the average consumer doesn’t have the rainy day funds needed to weather a recession, or potentially even a mild, but sustained, downturn. \n\n**The Silver Lining**\n\nIt’s unclear how many homes have been bought on margin. If its a small % then this may not matter. It’s clear that housing will hurt over the coming months if not years, but it could be a slow bleed instead of a pop. Regardless of the exact economic path we follow, it seems like a good time to tighten up on your debt and save for a rainy day if possible.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1.  https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/homes/us-home-prices-case-shiller-december-2021/index.html\n2. https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2022/04/06/using-a-margin-loan-versus-a-mortgage-to-purchase-property/?sh=459924512c93\n3. https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx\n4. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ukraine-war-fallout-threatens-economic-slowdown-and-stagflation-yellen-says-01652899157\n5. https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/19/bank-of-america-warns-stagflation-scenario-will-tank-stocks-says-keep-buying-energy-shares.html\n6. https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/19/goldmans-investor-guide-to-a-recession-shows-stocks-could-fall-another-11percent-to-18percent.html\n7. https://www.visualcapitalist.com/us-consumer-debt-16-trillion/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Federal%20Reserve,the%20highest%20seen%20since%202007.\n8. https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/car/used-car-prices-drop-cost-1000-dollars-less/'), ('Is it bad that I just want to see $TSLA crash to see all the permabull reactions?', 'Is it bad that I just want to see $TSLA crash to see all the permabull reactions?[removed]'), ('Me bagholding TSLA into next week', 'Me bagholding TSLA into next week'), ('Can someone explain why the open interest for SPY May 20 Puts are so ridiculously high?

However, I think for the most part this should be pretty simple to follow. **To put it plainly,** *if my work is right,* BITCN **and SPY may be moving in tandem together.** ***Not just recently either, but for several years now.***\n\nDown below is my second test using regression via excel. My first test was a simple test where, for ten days, I verified if BITCN\'s movement pre-market was in-line with how the overall market moved. It\'s worth noting as well that BITCN\'s price change will happen first with SPY following suit. Despite this being a small sample and sparsely indicative of what the real relationship was for me, acquiring the same movement all 10 days was more than enough to take this into a regression.\n\n# So, here is what I did to confirm this:\n\n**Step 1:** From Yahoo Finance, I took the weekly adj closed price for both BITCN and SPY from 2019 to 2021.\n\n**Step 2:** Once I compiled both onto excel with the correct dates, I *logged* both sets of data for scale and evaluated their correlation for both non-logged vs logged which, for non-logged data, the value came out to be .90 and for logged data, the value came out to .93 which means, logged or not, the two sets of data are highly correlated.\n\n[Total of 157 Observations](https://preview.redd.it/4e70jlvlvl091.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccbd7a66e9e09c55631c7a6d796c1a5f78a7a7c4)\n\n**Step 3:** I ran a regression between both SPY logged and BITCN logged. This gave me a t-value above 2 and a p-value well below 0.05 meaning that we could reject the null hypothesis.\n\n**Step 4:** I plotted my residuals from regression SPY on BITCN logged. Now, I did anticipate some kind of pattern, even a mild distinguishable pattern. I didn\'t expect my same of ten days to actually reflect a strong relationship.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6n9ymixzvl091.png?width=1267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51af0c656fd54cd43e24611b182051128af9c2ca\n\nSo, with much deliberation, here\'s my point to be made:\n\nDespite BITCN and SPY being vastly different from one another, the two somehow strongly correlate and systematically move together. I strongly encourage you to take the "BITCN Test" where, (if you can afford it), you buy 1 share of SPY. If BITCN during pre-market tanks, sell that SPY share off to avoid loss. If the next day, pre-market for BITCN are looking green, buy up, hold until markets open and follow along with how BITCN is moving.\n\nI originally thought that pre-market movement for BITCN was enough to shadow how the day will go but, to be safe, it\'s best to keep an eye on BITCN because BITCN almost always moves first.\n\nNow, as for answering the how, why, when or who? Absolutely no idea. If you\'ve been actively trading for the past two years, you\'d know damn straight that the market tends to move in together. You can see first hand scrolling through all of the S&amp;P500 stocks on green or red days. The mathematical curve for EVERYTHING, regardless of what they do or sell, all take on bouts of volatility that seemingly happen to the rest of the market, including BITCN now apparently. The only thing that sets BITCN apart from everything else is BITCN actually pushing live prices 24/7 a day which, if somehow connected to SPY, may give leeway into getting a fix into the game.\n\nAnyways, once I find a kind, supportive soul that\'ll be happy working further with me on this, I should be able to follow up the post with a pretty incredible forecast for Jan 2022.

Ended up being quite a few hundred videos. I wasn't looking for any bullish/bearish content from the speech. The signal I was looking to test for with this strategy was - can we glean any market information from the time of JPow's speeches, and/or do market participants act differently shortly after his speech?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The Strategy\n\nFuck JPow right? So anyways, I tracked the S&amp;P with 100% of the portfolio. Whenever JPow spoke, I reallocated 15% of the portfolio into daily puts (at the specific time of the speech). Used the same purchase price as strike price, so I benefit from a directional bet rather than a magnitude one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also did this with strategy with calls for fun. First time I've done an options strategy, so any feedback here is welcome!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## Execution\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn execution, it looked like this:\n\n\\- Took all the dates that JPow was speaking\n\n\\- Used the adjusted close/open to factor in dividends and splits\n\n\\- If you've followed along \\[my posts before\\]([http://reddit.com/u/SchemeElectronic9058](http://reddit.com/u/SchemeElectronic9058)), I always start off with a naive algorithm as a sanity check. If I'm able to get some sort of signal without doing much work on structuring the data, that makes me happy because there might be some kind of strong signal that you don't have to do statistical magic for\n\n\t\\- The naive algorithms used equities. What if we bought the SPY the day of JPow's speech, then sold either at end of day, or at open the next day\n\n\t\\- This time, the naive algorithm failed. Becaue you're mostly out of the S&amp;P, you don't get all the upside of the last 4 years. \\*\\*In hindsight, the naive algorithm (and using equities) was pretty fucking stupid.\\*\\* You'd have to have the thesis that the S&amp;P has the biggest jumps only on days JPow speaks, and is otherwise flat or in a bear market\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, then I tried a daily options strategy. When JPow's speech is released on C-Span, I bought an option the next hour, and exercised by the end of day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# The Performance\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*See next comment - this one got too long with performance data attached\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, the naive ones didn't do BAD - they just weren't exciting, and were really what you'd expect. Staying in cash most of the time and not making any big bets on direction means you're going to stay relatively flat (therefore beat probably 95% of WSB)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## PUT Portfolio\n\nThis was the strategy that reallocated 15% into puts right at the start of JPow's speech (or start of the next trading day), and exercised/let expire at the end of the closest trading day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\## CALL Portfolio\n\nThis portfolio did worse than the PUT portfolio when you look at the end of our trading period vs the start, but it did have some really, really good moments in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are the graphs for the people who can't read:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Call Strategy - notice the huge uptick during COVID and then the underperformance \\(even in a bull market\\)](https://preview.redd.it/3zm6d2tmaz091.jpg?width=1412&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dd492203da48483f4f63b38883cecb54fa6319f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[God I fucking love options](https://preview.redd.it/elxeyiizaz091.png?width=1162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19671c68fdc78051032426e634db829fe818d426)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\# Conclusion\n\nSo, yeah - JPow doesn't fucking have predictive power. Was a pretty stupid idea in hindsight. What we did learn here is that JPow's speech dates are very much a confounding factor - he speaks during times of crisis, meaning following them is a play on trading volatility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe best strategy based on the results here seems to be buying puts on a daily basis when there are inklings of panic and volatility, and then buying calls when you're sure people are panicked, scared, and volatile.

Lack of hedging with put options is creating a scenario that makes our ability to rally upward much harder and increases crash risk. Buy short-dated ATM straddles (more risky), buy puts, directly short the S&amp;P 500 (less risky), or stay in cash (not really risky at all) (see "How to position yourself").\n\n---\n\n&gt; *SINK RATE! SINK RATE!*\n\n\\- Boeing 787 MAX TAWS, being piloted by Captain Powell\n\n---\n\nLet\'s talk about options! The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) has the most liquid options market in probably the world. Now sometimes people, instead of using these derivatives for gambling based on what side of a yard a dog poops on, use them to hedge their exposures to stocks and the market. \n\nThey are bought and sold by market makers (Citadel\'s the king, obviously, but there are others). People (in general) buy put options and sell call options. Sometimes though, there are speculators who would buy call options and sell put options (think WSB, thetagang, your grandfather\'s pension, etc).\n\nMarket makers want to do one thing: capture the spread between the bid and the ask price. They don\'t care about short ladders or whatever. They\'ll happily be long or short SPX, GME^[1], TSLA, whatever if it makes them more money.\n\nIn order to hedge their exposure to the movement of stock price action (gamma), volatility (vanna), and time (charm), they buy and sell /ES (S&amp;P futures) to hedge to their delta^[2].\n\nIf dealers are negatively exposed to *gamma*, things get a bit volatile but if dealers get negatively exposed to *vanna*, things get real volatile real fast because they are selling into selling (which increases implied volatility, leading to more required delta hedging) and buying into buying (which decreases implied volatility, leading to more required delta hedging) in order to hedge.\n\nTo explain with a simple analogy: that crazy ex, she\'s vanna. Vanna will take you to your highest highs but will also take you to your lowest lows. And... yeah those lows will be low. And no, I\'m not going to help you "get over" her. And by the way, my bf is coming over for the week so we\'ll need the house.\n\nBack to options.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that dealers quote their options in *volatility* terms, not dollars and cents^[3]. But implied volatility is relatively low for a 1000 point drop right now and [*isn\'t increasing as we drop*](https://i.imgur.com/ct8TGaJ.png).\n\nThis is because there are a lot of people systematically selling puts, driving down IV. And because IV is being driven down by the put sellers, bulls can\'t get a sustained bear market rally (since these rallies are often fueled by rehedging)\n\nBut it\'s pretty obvious to anyone who\'s traded that realized volatility has far outstripped implied volatility (especially on the "FDs") and that FDs are relatively cheap. VIX is 29 right now, which implies about a 2%ish (off the top of my head) move each day. We\'re getting multi percent intraday moves, even if close-to-close we\'re going relatively slow. *This is absurd.*\n\nI could go on but you get the point already so let\'s move on.\n\n# How to position yourself\n\nSo... there are a couple ways you can play this relatively historic event depending on your risk tolerance (from most risky to least risky)\n\n1. **Buy straddles extremely close to expiration, especially on days with large intraday moves.** Because IV is chronically underpriced here, you should be able to make money buying 0 DTE straddles. Don\'t use Robinhood or anything like that, they\'ll screw you over by market selling your position early. Also don\'t do it systematically, because you will lose out when you don\'t get the move you want.\n2. **Buy somewhat longer term put options.** SPX 6/21 3800p (SPY 6/21 380p) is probably a decent option and has a decent chance of going ITM. You can sell on a volatility spike or keep them going into expiration.\n3. **Keep hitting those tails.** 3σ 30 DTE SPY put options (it\'s currently SPY 6/21 305p) are only 13bps ($0.50). On a massive move, those tails will explode in value. You\'re not going for them going ITM, you\'re going for P/L so you can unload your bags onto Citadel. Buy them when VIX is in the 20s.\n4. **Short E-Mini S&amp;P 500 futures (/ES or /MES) or SPY or something.** This will be probably the least gut wrenching thing to do. You\'ll make a lot of money, but you probably won\'t get a heart attack in 20 years from the stress of watching options change rapidly in value. So... it has its downsides. Wait for a large volatility blow up (look at VIX) or for Fed to reverse course to unload your position.\n5. **Go cashgang.** Sure you\'ll miss out on gains, but you\'ll only decay at 8%/year vs. the 30%+ drop (+ decaying at 8%/year). You can [place $10k into I-bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm) if you\'re worried about inflation at an interest rate of 9.62% *risk-free*.\n\n(My positions are #4 and a bit of #3 opportunistically.)\n\nGood luck WSB, you\'re gonna need it.\n\n# Some anticipated criticism\n**But volatility is heteroskedastic!**\nYour criticism here is basically that IV doesn\'t move 1-to-1 with SPX and while that\'s true, realized volatility is still above implied volatility (VIX should be like in the 40s). But implied volatility is still implying that there isn\'t hedging and a deeper analysis reveals that in general, there are a lot of put sellers.\n\nThere\'s also a pretty well established inverse correlation in SPX with IV in general (although don\'t naively apply this to single stocks, especially ones like GME). \n\n**But volatility should be low for a sustained drop!**\n\nSure but volatility isn\'t constant and is based on a few things including how """fearful""" the market is. And even so, even if we sustained a constant move down every single day (which we don\'t) you\'d still have gamma P/L to contend with. This alone makes it so that volatility is 0 or whatever but it\'s also dependent on other factors here. What I\'m contending here is that these factors are such that volatility is massive underpriced, especially with the massive intraday moves that we are seeing.\n\n**VIX is a bad volatility index!**\n\nYeah I know but I used it for simplicity. Anyone in the vol space knows that SPX vol and skew (not the SKEW index!) isn\'t being bid up all that much relatively so... yeah.\n\n# Footnotes\n1. Stocks like GME and AMC which have relatively predictable behavior (i.e. lots of people buying call options to force rallies and rehedging) are very profitable for market makers like Citadel because they are able to collect very wide spreads on the options. MMs got caught offsides a bit by the January 2021 event (basically the options chain acted as if every option was 50Δ) and the gamma profile was very negative then, as anyone who works on a desk will tell you (this is what the SEC got wrong in their report).

While we did finish above the daily 8ema of 396.64 the failed to close the candle body over it and we also failed to break into the next resistance level of 398. Being that we failed to break that key 398 resistance that was easily obtainable it would be natural for us to retest support at 392.6 which we are currently trending dangerously close to after hours. \n\nOn the daily I drew four blue arrows. If you note these four blue arrows they all have about the same trend. 3 days to make a new LOWER high point near the daily 8ema that then leads to a massive sell off. The current daily candle much like the other three candles I highlighted all are hammer candles (with the exception of the April 21st candle).

I highlighted it in orange this time to show you just how strong this “channel” is that the VIX likes to trade within. Overall the VIX since end of April till now has traded between 28 and 34 for the majority of the time. Lately everytime the VIX bounces off this 28-28.5 range we see a pretty significant recoil back over 30 the following day. \n\nThe most notable times the VIX has gone under 28 and then seen a recoil the following day were April 26th (-2.9%), April 28th (-3.7%), May 5th (-3.55%), May 18th (-4%) and last Friday May 20th (while finishing +0.04 we all remember it had a massive drop from its height of 397 to 380.5). Now we have ole snapchat who decided to take a big oopsies with their earnings currently sitting at -30% (LOLLL), which also took FB (meta) down 7.32% currently and pretty much the rest of the market into the red I would say its all but in the bag that we should see a fairly red day tomorrow. One thing to note is that after hours that 393 support did hold fair strong. If we were to break under 393 it would be fairly easy to assume that we will see 388 tomorrow if not lower. 393 to 388 was a range we traded within a lot last week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f612x48x9b191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed229166f44bd46e899680fd1c1fddfd9aaf2913\n\nAnother reason im a big believe in puts overnight is that on the weekly SPY perfectly rejected tis resistance line that’s now 8 weeks old.

The analyst took note of Musk’s deal to acquire Twitter which should be completed via debt, equity, and a margin loan.\n\nSacconaghi pays special attention to $12.5 billion that will come from a margin loan facility tied to Tesla stock.\n\n“Following the recent drop in TSLA's stock price, Musk appears to have just enough value in his unencumbered Tesla shares to fund the margin loan portion of his proposed Twitter financing. That said, at a TSLA share price of $621 or less, Musk would technically not be able to borrow the full $12.5B against his shares - in fact, if TSLA's stock price were to drop to $500/share, he would be ~$2.5B short. If the agreed upon deal price for Twitter is ultimately haircut by 10%, Musk could still borrow enough, even if Telsa shares dropped to ~$400,” the analyst wrote.\n\nHowever, the bigger - but also less probable - financial risk for Elon Musk is there is a deeper pullback in Tesla shares, in combination with him completing the deal.\n\n“If the TWTR deal were to close today and subsequently TSLA's stock price dropped to $350-400, Musk could be forced to sell ~13M Tesla shares.”\n\nIn other words, Elon Musk would get a margin call.\n\nSacconaghi rates Tesla with an Underperform rating and a $450.00 per share price target as he struggles to justify TSLA's valuation, “which appears to imply huge volume AND industry leading profitability going forward, which is historically unprecedented.”\n\nTesla stock price is indicated to open 2.5% lower today, or at $657.90."), ('AAPL is heading to $110', 'AAPL is heading to $110'), ('We will soon see the greatest rally ever.

Which makes it nearly impossible to trust those other strong trend days. \n\nUntil the last hour of the day the range was 388 to 393 which is a range we have seen many times before. However bulls were able to break her out above that EOD but failed to close over the key 395 resistance for the next channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z6oozzifki191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4620bace72e3504b29d85131e01e96b35cc0a0f\n\nAnother user in my server posted a tweet that had this symmetrical breakout triangle right here. Overall this uses the peak of May 17th and May 23rd for resistance and support from May 20th and today.

We have been making higher lows since April 21st and making lower highs since May 2nd. We are going to see a massive SPIKE in the vix or a massive DUMP in the vix potentially as early as tomorrow. \n\nBull case- On arguably an easy lob to bears they failed to maximize losses today. The ViX only momentarily broke 31 before closing basically exactly where it opened. Despite the lower volume today bulls were able to but a 180 reversal on SPY today and prevent it from seeing 385 support again. Looking at May 19th there is a 387 double bottom in play. With FOMC minutes tomorrow if there are no surprises the markets could use this as a rallying point as there is not much new news for the next two weeks till we have CPI June 10th and FOMC June 15th. If bulls can get momentum this is there best shot at a 2 week rally. 393 has been a key support range for SPY and being able to close above that today should allow for a pop to the next resistance at 398 tomorrow. Todays daily candle finished in a dragonfly doji. Most of the time this is a reversal candle and could signal upside the next day. \n\nBear case- despite opening down 1% after the first hour it appears that SPY essentially realized there was an over reaction to all the earnings news. The VIX is still hanging out at its lower level near 29 which gives it a higher upside potential tomorrow especially if it holds that support line its been using to make higher lows. The daily dragonfly doji candle can be signaled as a revesal candle IF its at the bottom of a down trend. So think 3 red days in a row with the last being a dragonfly doji (look at May 2nd and really even May 12th for examples) but when the dragonfly doji is after a run up it could signal a loss of momentum and could cause a reversal back down. We closed the daily candle fully under the 8ema today of 396.03 and with the red bear channels resistance at 398 tomorrow (the same one as the 15minute) if we see a hard rejection there tomorrow morning at open we might get further downside throughout the day. The best bear case however would be a morning dump to test 387 if not lower closer to say 385 before we see a massive recovery EOD (probably due to fomc minutes) that results in a huge hanging man candle like we have seen 3 other times now ( April 21, May 4th and May 17th). Yesterdays and Fridays price action failed to break through the 398 resistance level and its pretty arguable that we can expect that resistance to hold strong. \n\nI posted it last night but the last two FOMC minutes have seen a morning dump followed by rally. \n\nFebruary 16th pre market had a massive gap up to 447.75 before falling all the way to 443.93 at open (-0.8%). From open SPY dropped from its high of 444.81 to a low of 441.94 at 1230 (-0.7%). However it held a range of 442.7 to 443.7 from pretty much 945 am to 2pm when FOMC minutes dropped. Once minutes dropped SPY went from a low of 442.02 to a high of 448.06 EOD (+1.3%). IT should be noted that spy closed at 446.61 on the 16th and dropped all the way to 437.11 the next day for a drop of (2.2%) the following day… Interestingly enough the VIX dropped all the way to 24 on the 16th only to end up back near 28 the following day before market closed…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nmzkm3iki191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ab2ebb1df42f83bc2793def608189ad4d8fcaf\n\nApril 6th FOMC minutes is much different though. Pre market saw a high of 451.27 at open before it immediately sold off until 8am hitting a low of 446.51 (-1.1%), however the 8am candle saw a huge spike to 451.11 (1.1%) before it then held the 446.51 range till open. At open spy dropped from a high of 447.59 to a low of 444.5 at 1215am (-0.7%). SPY held range most of the day and then saw a pop to opening price before FOMC minutes at 2pm. Now this one saw a MUCH different reaction and arguably this is the reaction we have gotten recently for fed stuff. Which is a spike up, a massive drop, then a massive recovery EOD. SPY shot up to 448.53 then immediately dropped to 443.47 by 230 (-1.1%) then rocketed to 448.93 (+1.2%) right before power hour before it dropped back to 445.32 (-0.8%) and recovered to close at 446.57 after another spike near 448. Interestingly enough the next day also saw a fairly large drop intraday from close of 446.57 to lows of 443.53 (-1.1%) before a MASSIVE v shaped recovery to 450.69 EOD (+1.6% from the V bottom). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ftr2raliki191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ece94b3705580bf73cbeaff71f90c95ab932a222\n\nBoth days saw a -0.8 to -1.1% open and both days then saw a -0.7% drop at open before holding range most of the day.  Unlike the last few FOMC and CPI which have been fairly predictable to be honest I feel like FOMC minutes are not nearly as easy to track. It seems fairy safe to expect a drop in pre market (though we see that spy is now up +0.42% AH) and then expect a 0.7% drop pretty much immediately at open which then leads to a range bound day all day till 2pm. \n\nThis could look like a -1% open= 389.95 at open followed by a 0.7% drop 387.22 range holding until we see FOMC minutes. This is quite interesting to me because we saw intraday today that 387 was such a strong support and we very well MAY retest that in the morning it appears. While this is 100% speculation I will be curious to see how this all plays out in the AM\n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall it was one of those days that started out GREAT and would have ended great if I stopped trading at 10am… we had some odd massive spikes in volume today and one of my puts got burnt really bad in the AM and then when it appeared we were dropping below 388.2 support I entered another put that too would get burnt. Overall one of those days where the reversal is hard to believe and doesn’t really match the technical. The strength of the sell pressure this morning should not have allowed what we saw today. Nonetheless we live to trade another day. It was another one of those days that had we just taken profits at 5-8% profits all day we woulda been making bank. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cqmnt9jki191.png?width=523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a0ff6d96441dfc2a5dc31a859ce170763e87092\n\nUnfortunately ended up marrying some puts over night… hoping my prediction is correct and we see a drop near 385 to 387 to be able to exit at less of a loss tomorrow. Despite AH being green I think there is some fear in FOMC minutes after what happened at the WSJ interview. However, I have fully accepted the fate of these puts. I had an opportunity to exit them on that fake out 245pm sell off and failed to do so. That sell off was very convincing and in a normal market we should have continued back to the LOD not made a new HOD during power hour. That is one of the reasons I do wonder if the bulls are going to be back in control for a while here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0lieiqjki191.png?width=673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e24615f75858b224abccf357cfb00025fd477ad'), ('55k Gain porn today trading 0DTE SPY puts &amp; GME calls', '55k Gain porn today trading 0DTE SPY puts &amp; GME calls'), ('NVDA good earnings, price go down?', 'NVDA good earnings, price go down?'), ('Nvidia Tumbles After Supply-Chain Woes Hurt Revenue Forecast - $NVDA', 'Nvidia Tumbles After Supply-Chain Woes Hurt Revenue Forecast - $NVDA[https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/RC6WM7T0G1KW](https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/RC6WM7T0G1KW)\n\n  Nvidia Tumbles After Supply-Chain Woes Hurt Revenue Forecast\n\nBy Ian King and Mark Gurman\n\n(Bloomberg) -- \n\nNvidia Corp., the largest U.S. chipmaker by market value, slid in late trading after Chinese supply-chain woes and the war in Ukraine weighed on its sales forecast. \n\nRevenue in the current quarter will be about $8.10 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday.

Here is a list of the most  common approaches we hear when talking with other TOGGLE users.  \nAlso remember that Fed Minutes come out today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5lwwn6odm191.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcc80f0b68e76bbf708d64e9f6f619a37d71c2ff\n\n&gt; **The** **Treasury Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The safe-haven investor is going all-in into Treasuries. They believe that the Fed will be able to hike only so much and are happy to get \\~3% from 10y US Treasuries and \\~3% implied inflation from TIPS.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Staples Investor**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Remember when Walmart rallied in Q4 of 2008? The Staples Investor remembers. This investor is pivoting to safe equities like staples, real estate, utilities and possibly energy. Recession or not, we need to eat, to rent and to turn on the lightbulbs. See you at the next recovery, they are confident they will be up.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Dividend Seeker**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Dividend Seeker is close in style to the Staples investor. With a nice drop in markets, dividends are becoming compelling again and the Dividend Seeker is looking for 4%+ dividends to weather the storm  \n&gt;  \n&gt;t**he Call Underwriter**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Call Underwriter owns a portfolio of equities and sells calls against it. Like the Dividend Seeker, they want yield. They do not believe equities will appreciate during the downturn, and seek the extra carry provided by selling premium.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Tech Investor**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Tech Investor is the new incarnation of the Staples Investor. Maybe 20 years ago Walmart was the safe choice, but the Tech Investor believes that now it’s Big Tech that is a safe choice. AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT are all infrastructure plays and they’re here to stay.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Short Seller**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The short seller believes in doom and gloom and will use inverse ETFs or even put options to stay short the market. “*The downturn has just begun, just wait till QT starts!*” said one of our most bearish users.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Note: QT is Quantitative Tightening, the unwind of QE.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;t**he Cash Hoarder**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Cash Hoarder thrived in a time of low inflation and reasonable real rates. Now they are facing a real challenge as real rates for short term bonds are deeply negative, and they are thinking maybe about moving to Japan.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Note ‘cash’ here is used as a synonym for T-Bills of 3M or lower tenor.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Dollar Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Dollar Bull knows how markets work during a recession. When the global economy falters, money flows back to the big ole US of A. The Dollar Bull is not unlike the cash hoarder, but they have a cross-currency view of things - and will pounce back on oversold foreign holdings one day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The \\[forbidden word\\] Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The \\[forbidden word\\] Bull has discovered that a popular asset class cannot escape correlation with the equity market. After \\[forbidden word\\] suffered yet another 60% drop from peak, the \\[forbidden word\\] investor is eyeing that $29.7k level from July 2021 and thinking “will it breach or rebound?”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**he Gold Bug**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Gold Bug knows that the precious metal is where the buck stops. Come hell or high water, recession or inflation, Gold is the ultimate safe haven. Russia war? High inflation? Recession? Gold is the answer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Conclusion**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are many valid approaches to invest for safety during a slowdown. If we blend together all these styles we get a defensive portfolio made of Treasuries, High Dividend / Defensive stocks, Gold, some \\[forbidden word\\] and a collar (i.e. a sold call and a long put).'), ('Who do you think you are? I am.', 'Who do you think you are? I am.Are you cucks going to finally start taking your investment advice from a Golden Corral cook with a gambling problem or are you going to continue listening to clowns like Meat Breath Kevin on YT?\n\nWhile Meat Breath continues rambling about nonsense while incessantly shilling his holdings, I’ve been giving specific, successful options advice. Let’s review:\n\n1. I said to buy $SOFI from $7 all the way down to $5. Calls printed when it bounced off of $5. I wouldn’t buy calls on much right now but $SOFI was trading at or slightly under book value a couple of weeks ago\n2. I said to buy TSLA puts at $740. I still think TSLA touches $435 before it finds support. I love TSLA as a company but it’s completely overvalued and that’ll hurt longs badly in this market. Period. No clue why anyone would buy TSLA calls in this environment.\n3. I said to short SNOW at $153. I said it would plummet into and after earnings Bc it’s overpriced SaaS nonsense not worth $50B. It’s worth about $15B-$18B, generously.\n4. I commented to short Trade Desk at $62. More overpriced shit not worth the $30B when I said short it. It’s worth about $10-$12B, generously.\n\nThe list goes on. But the point is, you’re cucking yourselves waiting for a rapid market turnaround. There will be no quick turnaround. There is no imminent bull rally. Say it with me - THERE IS NO IMMINENT BULL RALLY. Wall Street will continue fucking you, your wife and your wife’s boyfriend as you continue buying weekly call options. Nothing else matters right now except Wall St sentiment. Say it with me - NOTHING ELSE MATTERS RIGHT NOW EXCEPT WALL ST SENTIMENT. If you can see ahead how these guys are going to attempt to extract every dollar you own, you can win. \n\nWe are near a bottom for many growth stocks, but not all stocks. But that doesn’t mean once we hit bottom the stock market is going to suddenly rocket upwards. All of these YouTube clowns continue perpetuating this idea. The Fed will not begin printing trillions of dollars of Monopoly money like they did in Spring of 2020. We won’t be breathing a sigh of relief that a pandemic isn’t ending the world as we know it. Interest rates won’t be historically low. NONE of these catalysts are in place. When the stock market finally bottoms, it won’t bounce back quickly. It will, quite boringly, trade sideways for probably two years. So you can either continue buying short term calls and lose all of your money (I know, it’s what you all do best) or you can do the following:\n\n1. Sell weekly 10-15% OTM cash secured puts on recently destroyed growth and/or tech stocks you are okay wheeling (don’t do it going into earnings unless you are going 20%+ OTM). A lot of good growth and/or tech companies are near bottom. Could they fall more? Definitely. But the falls won’t be as drastic and rapid as they’ve been the last 12 months. Collect some fat weekly premium from degenerates like yourself\n\n2. For the time being (this could change when Wall St decides they want to fuck you differently, perhaps the mouth instead of the ass) buy slightly ITM 30-60 DTE puts on overpriced pieces of shit right before earnings. Yes, IV will be high. But you won’t be crushed when the stock moves down only 10% instead of down 20%. $SNOW today is a perfect example. This company will be trading under $100 within a few weeks. I had retards messaging me complaining that $SNOW has only dropped to $114 since I recommended buying puts at $153. WAT!? How far OTM are you buying?\n\n3. Buy slightly ITM 60-120 DTE puts on plainly overvalued pieces of shit.\n\nI’m trying to help you gamble successfully so that you can all come and work with me at Golden Corral. We can do cocaine on our breaks and hit up the Wendy’s dumpster after work for some sweet, sweet mouth. Here’s what I see as obvious plays going forward:\n\nABNB Sep 22 P $120 for ~$20. Everyone is about to feel poor. Like really fucking poor. When they realize their equities aren’t bouncing right back and their home value goes down 20% in value by the end of the year, nobody is going to want to spend money on an overpriced AirBNB shit shack for the week. The honeymoon period of the whole country feeling rich is ending very soon. Everyone will go back to being “temporarily” poor. ABNB at a $71B valuation is laughable. \n\nDASH Oct 22 P $75 for ~$18.50. This company could quite possibly be the biggest piece of shit on the stock market, and it’s valued at a hysterical $24B. Gas will remain super expensive for the foreseeable future. DASH drivers were already making almost no money and now will make even less with gas so high. They are leaving in droves. The restaurants that use DASH absolutely fucking hate them. DASH has no moat. As previously mentioned, once people feel poor again they will walk their fat asses to pick up their food as opposed to paying an egregious amount to have it delivered (assuming they are tipping - always tip generously you scumbags or don’t eat out. Period.) DASH is bleeding money. Like Carvana, Door Dash will be a remnant of its former self in the not-so-distant future. \n\nLI Sep 22 P $25 for $5. I actually bought these when they were only $3.35, still holding, but LI is the most overvalued of the overvalued piece of shit Chinese EV companies. $23.5B for a Chinese electric vehicle company without a dedicated following, trash authoritarian government, and who IPO’d in the middle of stock market mania in 2020? This piece of dogshit company screams fake Chinese accounting. It will be leveled either after TSLA plummets to sub $450 or before then. I would be hesitant to buy $LI at a $3B valuation.\n\nGood luck and fuck you.'), ('Just signed a personal loan for 250K to afford one TSLA leap contract (expiry June 2024) - Richness here i come!', 'Just signed a personal loan for 250K to afford one TSLA leap contract (expiry June 2024) - Richness here i come![removed]')], '2022-05-26': [('TSLA puts - should would could have closed in profit lol', 'TSLA puts - should would could have closed in profit lol'), ('$82k on SPY 250P 8/19/22', '$82k on SPY 250P 8/19/22'), ('$TLSA Enters the DEATH CROSS!', "$TLSA Enters the DEATH CROSS!DEATH CROSS: When a stock's 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average.

TLDR? Well then you certainly won\'t enjoy reading through the actual minutes. Overall, I don\'t believe the bottom is in. \n\n**Looking Forward:**  \n"*Market- and survey-based measures of U.S. inflation expectations continued to project a significant deceleration in inflation in the coming years. Nonetheless, far-forward inflation compensation rose over the period, and market participants remained attentive to the risk that, in bringing inflation back to 2 percent, the Committee would need to tighten by more than currently expected"*\n\nTo me this seems to fit in line with how the markets have struggled to price things in officially because of the high level of uncertainty surrounding the Fed\'s moves going forward. For the rate hike this month we all knew it was no longer 25bps but there were definitely people who thought that 75bps was a real possibility instead of 50bps. Other numbers regarding housing and consumer spending has shown that outside of market participants, there are a lot of citizens out there still willing to spend cash on services and "experiences." In order to quell this many believe the Fed needs to do more as indicated here.\n\n**Unemployment and Inflation:**\n\n*"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in March, and the unemployment rate declined to 3.6 percent. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics moved lower, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. The labor force participation rate increased in March, as did the employment-to-population ratio. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, remained elevated. The employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector rose 4.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March; this gain was much larger than the corresponding 2-month changes posted in each of the preceding four years and was the largest 12-month increase since 1990."*\n\nFrom my understanding of the most recent live speech given by JPow with the WSJ, which took place after the meeting for these minutes, JPow did all he could to dance around deliberately saying they cannot achieve their goals of lowering inflation without creating an uptick in the unemployment rate. Here we see in the quarter that unemployment actually declined which to me leaves the Fed thinking they have more to do in cooling inflation. With such pent up demand from supply chain and covid for the past two years, people are still willing to spend and the Fed has it works cut out to suppress this I believe. What\'s prolonging this task is how much wages have risen for people and in turn have allowed them to bear the brunt of inflation.\n\n*(Part of the Outlook Section)"All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 4.3 percent in 2022. PCE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.5 percent in 2023 and to 2.1 percent in 2024 as supply–demand imbalances in the economy were reduced by slowing aggregate demand and an anticipated easing of supply constraints. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside."*\n\nPivotal part to me is the "skewed to up the side" because time and time again we had heard rumblings of "peak inflation" after months of it being transitory as well. Of course they have to say that their plans are set to move inflation down, but all estimates/projections come with asterisk of "hey, things out of our control could make this worse."\n\n**Credit/Debt/Lending:**\n\n*"For most small businesses, credit appeared to be available, although these businesses’ demand for credit reportedly remained weak."*\n\nI don\'t have a full take on this point, but I think it is interesting enough to mention. We around March when the consumer credit numbers were released that consumer credit had been racking it up in record breaking levels. But here we see that small businesses, often linked to the middle class and working citizens, that they were not looking for credit. Did they not need it? Could they not afford to take on debt of any kind? I don\'t know.\n\n\\*"\\*The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and households remained strong overall. The volume of credit rating upgrades for corporate bonds outpaced downgrades moderately in March, continuing a nearly yearlong pattern. The credit quality of C&amp;I loans on banks’ books continued to be strong as delinquency and default rates both remained low. Delinquency rates on bank and nonbank loans to small businesses edged down in February, while in the CRE sector, borrower financial health continued to recover. Household credit quality remained strong, and delinquency rates across both prime and nonprime borrowers continued to be subdued by historical standards."\n\nPer recent articles in the WSJ and Bloomberg, this does not seem to be the case anymore, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-subprime-borrowers-are-missing-loan-payments-11652952602](https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-subprime-borrowers-are-missing-loan-payments-11652952602)\n\n*"Business debt remained elevated relative to its pre-pandemic history, but interest coverage ratios were high."*\n\nDo you see this deteriorating? We see some larger cap tickers already saying they are not looking to hire as much. Saving money starts small, but its methods expand to all aspects of business when times get tough.\n\n*"The staff noted that leverage at key nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) was elevated and that bank lending to NBFIs continued to increase notably. Relatedly, NBFIs’ reliance on bank credit lines to meet unexpected liquidity needs could generate moderate liquidity pressures at large banks during times of financial stress."*\n\nI found this to be interesting, it was the last part of the "Staff Review of Economic Situation" section. They said that banks are well capitalized, that the consumer is strong, and that credit ratings for companies had gone up overall during this time. But, then why are NFBI\'s needing to borrow so much money? NFBI\'s can be considered as payday loan providers and even companies like J.Crew by offering store credit cards.\n\n**Reverse Repos:**\n\n*"Market participants noted that ongoing uncertainty about the near-term path of Federal Reserve policy had increased demand for very short-dated investments. This demand, combined with declining Treasury bill supply, contributed to the downward pressure on secured rates and to rising overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) usage. The manager expected that ON RRP usage could remain elevated in coming months but anticipated that, over the longer term, usage would decline as balance sheet reduction proceeded."*\n\nIt is worth noting again that these notes are from the meetings on May 3rd. Since then, RRPs (reverse repos) have hit an all time of $2 trillion. Meaning that almost a month later we have still seen RRPs grow, which to me means that big money players out there are still feeling unsafe in parking their money places overnight to this day, meaning if they\'re uncertain about things still, then we should still be cautiously worried about he economic outlook.\n\n**Households:**\n\n*"Households’ debt-to-GDP ratio remained relatively low, and there were few signs of increased stress among lower-income households."*\n\nI wonder what he gauge will be like in their eyes next meeting or come the fall.\n\n*"In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that they expected robust growth in consumption spending. They pointed to several elements supporting this outlook, including strong household balance sheets, wide availability of jobs, and the U.S. economy’s resilience in the face of new waves of the virus."*\n\nSee my second comment of the next section (GDP/Inflation) below.\n\n*"Employment growth had continued at a strong pace, the unemployment rate had fallen to a near50-year low, quits and job openings had remained extremely elevated, and nominal wages had continued to rise rapidly. In addition, a few other participants suggested that the unwelcome erosion of real incomes due to high inflation may have contributed to the increase in labor supply."*\n\nHow do we have participants saying that the consumer spending is robust and strong and that they see growth this year, then say well maybe there are so many people coming back to look for jobs because they need money? Stagflation incoming?\n\n*"Most participants indicated that their business contacts had continued to report that substantial increases in wages and input prices were being passed through into higher prices to their customers."*\n\nEventually there is going to be a tipping point in what consumers are willing to pay, right?\n\n**GDP/Inflation:**\n\n*"The staff therefore anticipated that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and advance at a solid pace over the remainder of the year."*\n\nWell we will find out in 7 hours.\n\n*"Participants commented that after its rapid growth in the last quarter of 2021, real GDP had declined in the first quarter of this year, with net exports and inventory investment making large negative contributions to growth. They noted, however, that these volatile components tended to contain little signal about subsequent growth and that household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong in the first quarter."*\n\nHonestly, stagflation may become a real issue. If the Fed does all they can to quell the inflation, but consumer spending is not stopped due to wage increases and its lagging effects, this could lead to trouble. I\'m conflicted though, because in a sense, I can feel inflation in daily life, and I find it hard to believe that the consumer really is "strong." But if the spending numbers are strong still as they keep mentioning (gotta remember this is for Q1 though), I feel like that puts us more in the direction of stagflation.\n\n*"In addition, some participants emphasized that persistently high inflation heightened the risk that longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored; in that case, the task of returning inflation to 2 percent would be more difficult."*\n\nThis in reference to household balance sheets being strong due to cash stimulus, QE of covid times, and wage raises are record increases. I wonder what participants said this because this is the smart take, in my opinion we\'ll see inflation more plateaued like for a long time before we see anything near 2% again YoY.\n\n**Rates and Fed Balance Sheet:**\n\n*"Most participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings."*\n\nI wonder if those who were not part of the most were more in favor of 75bps or 25bps. I still think 75bps is truly on the table.\n\n*"This reduction, starting on June 1, would work in parallel with increases in the target range for the policy rate in firming the stance of monetary policy. A number of participants remarked that, after balance sheet runoff was well under way, it would be appropriate for the Committee to consider sales of agency MBS to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Treasury securities. Any program of sales of agency MBS would be announced well in advance. Regarding risks related to the balance sheet reduction, several participants noted the potential for unanticipated effects on financial market conditions."*\n\nSince, May 4th SPY has fallen about 8.2% and since May 5th it has fallen about 4.8%, but some think once more QT comes into fruition on June 1st that more pain is on the way. I wonder if there is a way to play this, I used to think TBT was a solid way once the Fed started to get bonds of their balance sheet but I don\'t know.\n\n*"At present, participants judged that it was important to move expeditiously to a more neutral monetary policy stance. They also noted that a restrictive stance of policy may well become appropriate depending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook."*\n\nI view this on a scale from Easy - Neutral - Restrictive scale and we are somewhere between the Neutral and Restrictive side meaning that the Fed has to be more hawkish in its action due to things out of their control like supply chains with China and commodities in Europe.'), ('SPY fighting to catch a breath above 400', 'SPY fighting to catch a breath above 400'), ('My relapse single-handedly brought back the US Economy.', 'My relapse single-handedly brought back the US Economy.After 9 long months of living option free, I decided to spice up my degenerate life and throw a few thousand at some SPY puts expiring 5/27.\n\nNow you might ask “how did your single relapse bring back the economy?”\n\nTo that I remind you that it is written in law by gods and men that my options are always red. \n\nTake advantage of my sacrifice, buy calls.'), ('I’m done gambling', 'I’m done gamblingI’m quitting.

The BULL MARKET stabilizes up, to allow for a violent overextension downwards  (aka bear trap) **WHILE MAINTAINING A BULLISH BIAS**. I thought this overextension would last \\~3 days. The drop(hedge funds blew up that day), the doji, then CPI reversal, as most simple vix events last 3 days with that pattern. Instead it took 3 weeks- but the same pattern held true. The purpose of this is to maintain bearish momentum in the market...either much further out-years, or EXTREMELY violent this year, we\'ll get to that. "that means the market knows where it\'s going?" Yes. It does. Crazy for a million reasons? Yes, but true.\n\nThe importance of Friday\'s move is this...Market up 2%, UVXY flat. Market up 2.2% UVXY flat. Market up \\~.4% in the last 30 seconds of trade, UVXY CRUSHEDDDD. The last week of movement wasn\'t bullish- it was just NOT BEARISH. The "bull market" just activated the last 30 seconds of trade...so what do you think is coming, apes? The market wasn\'t even impulsing higher, it was a reactive move off of the blow off bottom the last 3 weeks...and you know this...because of HOW UVXY MOVED. I\'ve watched UVXY/SPY movement every day for 10 years. This is the correlation. This is why so many people are confused when they are both up or down together. It has NOTHING to do with decay. ur mother\'s ass warts, or Trump. \n\nAnother way to see this is May 19th. The market was flat but UVXY got CRUSHEDDD. This represents the market "catching the weight of the market and holding+accerlerating up". I know this to be true because, again, I\'ve watched the correlation for 10 years. It may take a day a week or 6 months to play out, but it always does and it\'s up to YOU to figure it out. **It is the larger wave dynamic in the market doing what it needs to do to prepare for future moves.** And in this case, it is confirming it already!\n\nThis is only 1 piece of many many things I see and, thus, I see an enormous wave higher coming into the summer. I have my targets and assumptions of what to see. Basic TA can NEVER see these waves, which is why so many people get fucked. A candle is not a candle is not a candle. The quality of the intraday movement actually matters.\n\n**Targets: SPY ATH or close to ATH by August- we are in buy the dip trend not sell the rip- everyone in the world is saying sell the rip :), The meme/arkk trade will explode in June/July. I expect GME to break at least 250 with a target of about 380 with possible ATH. All other meme targets will track GME target as they are all basket stocks and move together.**\n\nSorry to burst the bubble, though, after this rally there is a very high chance we\'ll have a flash crash in about August **if** things get triggered. We will flash crash in a way the market has never seen before as per the VIX wave dynamic. This down momentum NEVER DISAPPEARS. It is FOREVER in the market until it gets released. If not this year, it will eventually happen that I can time when ready. I\'ve never seen something this scary before. Like actually I get scared thinking about it. My guess is \\~75 on the vix, but REALLY fast with a fast recovery. This isn\'t "the big one" for the memes or the market itself either. It\'ll be a great buying opp into 2023 for boomer stocks if it happens in Aug.\n\nTLDR: Hopefully I could have shed some light on UVXY, which blew up my account many years ago- if I can help a few degens not double down on bearish sentiment, why not? Buy and hold memes into July and if things get triggered, a flash crash of epic proportions in August.

Trade the opening hour today, a few intraday moments and power hour today. Overall I have a similar plan tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kko0kjvbw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4835140d30388ffff2aa332d493307662aa8c4f2\n\nOverall I didn’t miss much today… mostly a pretty unexcited and expected range day. Mondays (todays the Monday of the week) lately have been pretty sideways trading. Afterhours is showing some green but nothing to overly write home about yet. However there is a support line that the 15min charts holding fairly well and Friday we saw an afterhours rejection of the resistance line Friday of the bull channel and spy intraday today failed to break that high. \n\nHowever as we take a look at the daily and the weekly we see a little more detail of possible moves. Overall I will try and be a little more detailed here due to no post on Friday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7i0b7gywbw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07060e2199267be23baa67c6f5cc953f299d131c\n\nNote the highlighted circles that I will later speak on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqt5l7sxbw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46c2066249e60daa56d5bca6522a15dc22527b67\n\nOn the daily we have a very nice bull channel we have been trading with in since May 19th with support being established on May 20th. Friday we saw a pretty much wickless candle close and I had mentioned in my server Friday I felt about 75% confident in overweekend puts but I didn’t enter then as I knew I would be camping and was unsure of service. Overall those would have printed today. We have followed that wickless candle up with a beautiful red doji. While hard to tell it is technically a gravestone doji due to the candle body being slightly shifted below which is actually a signal of a reversal of trend. Previous daily tends ending in a doji like today have resulted in massive sell offs. \n\nWe also have a gap on the daily from 407.04 to 407.7 that will need to be filled. \n\nIn addition what we saw today was a rejection intraday of 416.5 which now makes a double top there on the 15min chart. In addition if we look back to April 26th to May 5th this was an important price level. SPY failing to reach this Friday and hard rejecting it today during a bear market rally in my opinion is a bearish sign . I believe SPY has lost its bear market rally momentum and we are going to see a retest of lower support. If we look at the May 2nd and May 6th candle 405.6 was a major support for them (and resistance on May 9th/ 10th). It is likely we see a retest of this area before we go any higher. That would be a 1.7% drop from close today. Everyone is saying this is just like Marchs rally but it really in many ways is not and this candle finish today is confirmation that it is not going to be the same result. I think many people are about to get really burnt on that. \n\nI adjusted my probable/ improable zones a little as you can see. \n\nIf SPY is able to continue this rally though, we could see 427 as fast as Friday. That is a likely high and rejection zone for SPY. If we managed to break through that we could see as high as 438 by June 7th (right before the next CPI). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b58otmi3cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1f194e97ba671f4558f34f77e80b5e2d7decc3f\n\nOne thing to note on the weekly of SPY is that it FAILED to close and break above the weekly 8ema last week. Today did see us break it momentarily however we are not at a doji on the weekly and we are seeing SPY well below the weekly 8ema again. Likely support is the weekly 100ema of 405.92 (remember I said 405.6 was a key support area earlier… that’s likely to be tested)…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19kvqz44cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f0447485c59723a540b5b0de4b7e267ff0b6f25\n\nApple has the same finish today with a near double top doji and a gap from 144.34 to 145.26. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6olau4cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718a7e4f39a829d012f6079422599be1e4a77f2b\n\nYou guess it… QQQ has the actual double top with a doji on the daily AND a gap from 300.92 to 302.42.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ebdvpi5cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34610e7b0fd28436d0312c42a5fe98deebf293b8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unhlhzx5cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57af63c3d97ff72be8736c16cf7ec6d62b977bb8\n\nInterestingly the VIX opened with a massive near $2 gap up which is most likely the result of the morning dump. However once we breached 30 for a short period of time we did see it sell off the rest of the day before settling with 26 as its low. It never managed to break its Fridays lows. \n\nThe things I am seeing with the VIX is that we are still making lower highs BUT we are really struggling to make lower lows too. I drew a fat red line at VIX of 25 as the line in the sand. We will not have a true rally under VIX drops back under 25. \n\nA few things to keep in mind as we head into tomorrow. Tomorrow starts a new month and we know how Spy can change tunes fairly quickly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/geqfscw6cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4870ebb67d04d4e3961ba3e92516a31ccaf82430\n\nWhile this is NOT new news… this is enough to “spook” the market tomorrow in my opinion. Plus we don’t really know what this is going to look like. \n\nOverall I am bearish for tomorrow. If SPY can hold the 405 support area either tomorrow or this week I suspect we could get a bounce and rally further up towards that 430-440 levels. However, if we break below and especially close below 405 I do believe we have some more downside headed our way. This was enough of a bounce to shake people outta long puts and trap people in long calls to start the trend back down. \n\nIf SPY is big green tomorrow and recontinues the bull run on good momentum today like we saw last week I will too remain bullish till we see closer to that 430. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nDidn’t trade much like I said today (honestly kinda felt great)… hit half my daily profits during opening hour and just vibed till I found a good entry). I liked it. Reminded me of my prime trading days that I really need to get back to. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjbyt0j7cw291.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7a5dd7b4a0bb787215a87761db792bc8dba206\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubw582y7cw291.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95556354368bcd30bb4b4035c54b8a5492bc6b00\n\nOvernight I decided to swing this put… bought it at 1.33 premium with expected VIX rising back near 27-30 again I will be looking at some nice profits as long as we open below 410.

Or maybe they saw some other retard on the front page talking about how the MACD Crossover meant this stock **could not possibly go down again.**\n\nThe point is - most people write off trading indicators and pretty much all forms of technical analysis without really understanding what it is, or what it is used for.\n\nI\'m going to take a moment to elaborate on **why 99% of the technical analysis you guys see on the internet is complete bullshit -** and I\'ll even talk a little bit about how you can use some of it in a non-retarded way. \n\n[Better TA Than Most Of The Shit Posted](https://preview.redd.it/q20i72v0c1391.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58db4b87fdfe306fdcb7f902c31220665d0b8b87)\n\nThis actually might take longer than a moment, I am a retard after all and not great at counting (past 10), so grab some chicken tendies and sit tight.\n\n# The Basics\n\nTo understand why most TA is bullshit, first you need to understand **what it even is.** Surprisingly, most people don\'t.\n\nPut simply, TA is just about any form of analysis that uses **price and volume.** These are the two building blocks of TA. At face value, all a technical analyst has at his disposal is **price and volume.**\n\n# The Problems &amp; How Most "Traders" Use TA\n\n[The Usual WSB TA Post](https://preview.redd.it/m13sgru4c1391.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c2d0e3ab4ee404a914c70f03ae10164f27251b)\n\nContinuing on my last point. **RSI, MACD and all the other "indicators" you see are literally just ways of automatically organizing price and volume that our monkey brains couldn\'t possibly do in real time.** \n\nThey are not supercomputer machine learning algorithms that can save you from blowing up your portfolio. Depending who you ask, they can be beneficial for trading, but most people take it all completely out of context.\n\nThey take something like RSI and think: okay, when it\'s low, I buy - cannot go tits up.\n\nNow you might be thinking "what\'s the issue, when I look at a chart with RSI overlayed, it looks pretty darn useful"\n\n**That\'s precisely the problem!**\n\nIf you glance at a chart and compare it to lot\'s of indicators - **they often appear useful.** However, this is where human psychology and our tendency towards bias comes into play. While at a glance it seems simple enough to just buy when MACD Crosses over - when you actually try this strategy out - you might explode your portfolio.\n\nWhy is this?\n\n1) An indication to enter a trade is simply **one single part** of a complete trading system. \n\n* It does you absolutely no good without knowing when to take profits, what option do you buy if you are trading options, how much stock or options do you buy, when do you stop loss if the trade is going wrong. The point is - there are so many other things that comprise a profitable trading system aside from **"WHEN TO ENTER" - that\'s the easiest part! At face value, you have a 50% chance of being right regardless of what you are using to determine that!**\n\n**2)** The technical method you are using to indicate when to enter a trade actually has no statistical significance.\n\n* Remember how I said we have a tendency towards bias? When you are looking to go long on a stock, **your brain is already in confirmation bias mode.** You already decided to go long, you are just looking for the courage to pull the trigger. In this state, if you take a look at a chart, and on that chart buying at RSI 20 works 50% of the time - you will likely convince yourself into thinking it works most of the time! **Most technical analysis you see on the internet is cherry picking for confirmation bias.**\n* A final point on statistical significance - 10, 20 or even 100 data points **does not prove statistical significance.** Market conditions constantly change, and with them so does what form of trading works and what form of analysis. In trading, you can\'t safely assume statistical significance without backtesting something across thousands of data points going back many years, and then forward testing it in today\'s market! For the record, most indicators by themselves do not have any predictive value. Like I said before, they are just organizing price and volume in a different way. In other words, they are telling you what you already know, but making it more glamorous.\n\n3) The last (surprisingly common) issue with how most people do TA is that they **do not even take the time to learn how to do the bare minimum properly.** \n\n* What I mean is, 99% of people on the internet can\'t even draw a trendline right. If you are this far gone - you will have much better luck using your pet Gecko\'s dietary habits to determine when to buy and sell (most of you probably weren\'t around for that age of WSB!).\n\n# The Solutions &amp; What TA Is Really Used For\n\nNow that we have laid out why 99% of TA on the internet sucks ass - let\'s hear the other side of the story - and how you can use it in a non-completely-retarded way. The reality is, there are not many methods other than TA for trading **short-term.** Income statements and discount cash flow models will do you no good trading options weeklies. \n\nWhen doing short-term trading - TA can actually be quite useful - so long as you understand the limitations it has. \n\nSo, what are some basic things you can employ to take **some usefulness** from TA instead of blowing your portfolio up because of it?\n\n1) Stop listening to other people\'s analysis. Do your own fucking research.\n\n* If you are going to do it, and going to fuck it up, at least have the decency to fuck up on your own, instead of following DickBusterXxX9012\'s Inverse Head and Shoulders setup he posted on WSB after watching a 5 minute YouTube video on what an "Inverse Head and Shoulders" is. It\'s funny how we will do anything we can to avoid actually fucking learning how to do something these days. Pick up a fucking book or something.\n\n2) Understand TA (and indicators) are not and will never be an end all be all.\n\n* **The truth is, TA is not a definitive methodology for being a profitable trader**. It\'s simply a way of plotting a roadmap to make better risk/reward trades than you would be able to otherwise. Sometimes, very rarely, the risk/reward you get from this roadmap, **in combination with all the other parts of a system I outlined in the last section**, results in you making a profit. \n* Whether this profit is better than just throwing your money in SPY, or a profit at all, determines on your "**edge" -** or what you have to bring to the table that all the other retard\'s aren\'t already doing. In other words, what you can do differently that sets you apart. This is something that comes from thousands of hours staring at charts and studying or researching. No one can give it to you. The billion dollar Renaissance algorithms already arbitraged all the easy shit out.\n\n3) Never make a trade based on a single data point in technical analysis.\n\n* Remember I said most indicators alone have no predictive value. While this is true, multiple things lining up **can be useful.** Confluence is the lifeblood of technical analysis. If you decide to take things further and do some studying or research on the topic, make sure you are looking at multiple factors and how they coincide with each other. Looking at just a single indicator like RSI will never give you an edge.\n\n4) Learn how to separate bias from truth.\n\n* What truly separates a good technical analyst from a bad one is their ability to discern what is their emotions trying to confirm what they would like to happen, from what is actually a fact. The former is what most people do, and will do you no good. The latter can offer some assistance in picking short-term trades with favorable risk/reward. You could literally plot a chart in any number of ways that fits what you would like to happen, but there is only one way to plot what is most likely to happen.\n\n# Conclusion &amp; TL;DR\n\nThere is no secret magical indicator that is going to make you rich. It doesn\'t exist. Indicators themselves are not some revelation, they are just shit we already know stated differently.\n\nMost TA on the internet is completely incorrect and retarded, but that doesn\'t mean TA as a whole is completely retarded. Without it - there really isn\'t many other ways to make short-term trades. If you want to use it, take it with a grain of salt, and do it on your own. Following behind other people\'s shitty analysis will do you no good. \n\nHowever, TA isn\'t as easy as watching a YouTube video. There is no shortcut to being a good trader. It requires many hours of studying and practice. \n\nIf you aren\'t willing to do that - then just stop using it at all - and enter your trades based on whether you or your wife\'s boyfriend are fucking her that night.

Good… now lets jump into it. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjhvnwulp2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d893775ce8e52cdc1bb685b2c142950795fae13e\n\nClassic spy today with about 11 reversals… Morning started off hella bullish with that 1%+ green open and we even tested the major resistance of 416.6. It looked like we were early on consolidating ready to bust through resistance and finally see the 420s… Well low and behold we were actually preparing to dump the rest of the day. Somehow SPY still managed to pull out a green day. Its actually funny because these bearish days are being masked by a small green day close. \n\nIn the last month we have had 11 of these non trend days &lt;1% +/- and only had 10 trend days &gt;1% +/-. Overall that’s 50% of the time that SPY is finding itself in some sort of chop. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/911ikptmp2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f614968318013f986d5d5bc99683faa04c288746\n\nDaily wise we DID break the bull channel support. However, there is a case to be made for slight error adjusting the bull channel down to look like this. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j77euqenp2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaa329e4ef482cd30597a2ca41fc7199a764c908\n\nAs you can see the more important thing we see here today is the purple downward channel. As you can see we are stating to make lower highs now. We are yet to make a lower low which would happen if we break 406.93 this week. This is using the sideways chop from May 27th to present. \n\nI will closely be watching the black bull channel and the purple channel tomorrow. If we are to drop another candle below the black support line which would happen unless SPY see another large gap up above 413.7 tomorrow (key resistance from 2pm today). And bulls would have to run all day long with no stop to keep us in the black channel. If this black channel breaks tomorrow I will start to look for the next leg down. Which with CPI on Friday its highly likely we will see it very soon. \n\nPurple channel gives resistance at 416.2 and support at 404.3.\n\n409.4 remains major support though. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ud90j32op2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae3db89e7b25cdc0e10fe48b746cfd6bac3d0209\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwzrhwnop2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cbba05b5b33ffdeaed1429c16b749219e82e3bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6gx5h6pp2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9954d3d741ac93dc7fa7a935871111e352422cfc\n\nMonitoring the VIX you will see that we today broke through the downward resistance line. We are finding ourselves at a break out back to 30 or break back down to 20 trend here. We did break through resistance today so one could assume we are going to see 30 by EOW especially when we look at CPI on Friday. Now the one thing to note is that since Thursday we have been stuck in this 24.8 to 25.8 chop zone. The VIX cant quite unwind and the VIX cant quite rocket up either. Until we see a close back under 24 or back over 26.5 I don’t think SPY is going to see this sideways chop and reversal happy days stop. \n\nToday is another one of those days that drive you nuts. Everything and all your indicators are firing and looking perfect the trend looks as trendy as it cant and you enter seconds before a fat reversal. I am still not quite sure this morning what caused that 11am dump nor the nearly 1% spike on the VIX. But that moment cause SPY to go into a downward trend. At 2pm the volume and momentum was all there for a recovery too and yet again got clapped down quickly. \n\nmy best advice right now... is bunker down if you are struggling.... cut your position size by 1/5th and just vibe... dont trade unless you feel 10000% confident in your position. If you dont want to risk anymore get a TOS paper account. There is no reason in this market not to take a break from real money... we need to protect our accounts and our futures... we can not make bad choices that lead to accounts getting blown up. \n\nToday and friday i am afraid is alot of what we are going to see for the next months or so until either SPY finally reaches capitulation OR we finally recover from inflation and markets feel confident feds not going to crash this market. we are close to neither of these and until we see one of these play out most days we are burning money. \n\nWe need to go heavy on the one trend day we get (those 3-4% days and go beyond light on fuckery days like this). It appears to me that if we are not seeing VIX fully track with the trend (so vix up and spy down…. Vix down and spy up) that we are going to be stuck in chop. With CPI coming up on Friday it will be very interesting to see what the markets are going to do especially with FOMC following up 3 days later. \n\nI am having a hard time being bullish or bearish here. I think personally we are going to chop in this 407 to 417 range until Friday and that’s going to decide whether we are going to 440 or whether we are going to 360 again. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall got burnt on some calls this morning when I was looking for the 416.6 breakout and from there it was just an untradeable day. Made two small scalps and that was it. Looking forward to cpi and fomc being overing and hopefully getting back to some trend days this month. I don’t really care if its up or down just give me some sort of direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77p7a3eqp2491.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c12a7c8f23f53f1459ac9845f1f5f6b27d828d34'), ('You heard him, load up on $AMZN', 'You heard him, load up on $AMZN'), ('$AMZN down big time.

I am going to be very conservative in my trading for the foreseeable future I have decided to cut my position size by 1/5th and my daily profit goal by 1/5th. Right now this is a tough market and until we get back to the clear trend days and a non reversal happy SPY there is no reason for me to trade full position sizes nor be aggressive. \n\nAlso to any of you guys using ARMERs momentum need to realize its function and limitation... this is NOT build for quick scalps (well i take that back it IS but its missing the money flow aspect of it). this shows sustained momentum trends... this shows the trend we can trust and confirms momentum... this is to be used in addition to the 8ema (my opinion not his)... we can look at just momentum and easily make some trades... HOWEVER, we need to be correct and time it correctly... \n\nthe thing about this too is this may give one or two perfect trades a day (like the call i took earlier) we need to be patient... this isnt a enter as soon as it flashes as it can flash off quickly if momentum isn’t sustained.  \n\nFor me this is how i use this.... SPY, spy breadth, SPY MACDBB 1min, VOLSPD, VOLD and ADSPD (advancing/ declining stocks) have to all be the same confirmed momentum and the VIX has to be trending with ADX and momentum (opposing obviously) before I enter. \n\nIF any of them is missing i wont enter (this is my new rules after so many reversals and fake outs) today so far its saved me from 4 potential trades i would have entered but was missing one aspect.... \n\nAlso, for me i use this as an exit... IF we are in a trade and we turn off momentum then im out. we can always re-enter but if we lose an indicator i like to exit... this is my new trading method. and also how i recommend trading this market until we get back I not a smoother SPY. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ejvb4g1oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6928bec10fe338e6f20cfd51a98f155348ba0394\n\n(Neutral- no momentum on any)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4pbicw1oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=232e47b622f40c12842dd2f46b530e1fdfc9e934\n\n(Confirmed bullish momentum entry)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xtfl4f2oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25b8a1746b689af5d5593c725fe19a3ff103a078\n\n(Time to exit from bullish entry)\n\nObviously this is an extremely conservative approach to trading but as I have said numerous times now this is how we need to trade this market… There is no reason to be aggressive right now.

Well one would be wrong. Today we saw the VIX hit a peak of 26.24 right before market open and then from there it never stopped unwinding all day long. This unwinding of the VIX was critical to SPYs morning run and the EOD run too. However, looking at the VIX one would assume we would have a 2%+ green day not this measly 0.96% green day BUT technically with the morning dump and pre market dump we did see about a 2% green intraday move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvw6wql3oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ccd2189de4cbe522147d213f5fbfec0336a31fb\n\nTrend wise you can see that we clearly broke out of the bull channel. However, we are maintaining the purple “sideways” channel which is really a slightly downward channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kw0dm564oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=513cf99790b1dadecda4ad20c0410ccdb17ed77d\n\nWith a slight tweak we might actually be in a slightly bullish upward channel. Personally I favor us topping out, with today confirming the break of the bull channel and we will now start our downward decent. Especially with CPI Friday and FOMC next Friday I have a hard time believing that we are going to be very bullish long term. \n\nOn the daily I highlighted three big green candles. As you can see the last two big green candles were followed by red days with the most recent one being a significant gap down. \n\nOn the daily we did close over resistance of 415.5, however, we failed to breach the higher lows trend of the channel. Tomorrow daily range for the purple channel is 416 to 405. If we break out of 416 then we might be in that black channel I mentioned, but again I favor at best some sideways action. I think there is a lot more pressure on this CPI then the previous ones personally. If this is a miss we are gonna see a bigger reaction then we do most CPIs.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mk9l3ys4oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e22cb60a39515fc04f21fe18509f5e11e61c4591\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkk0ovb5oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b4a3a7818bf00e8a587c5d21749b581fccff644\n\nAs you can see the VIX is slowly unwinding I mentioned yesterday that bulls would not be able to get any sort of footing if we did not see the VIX break under and hold under 24.8. Well today they finally did it. We are not approaching a longer term support line for the VIX. It will be very interesting tomorrow to see what the VIX does… If we see a massive recoil off of this 24 support range I bet we will start our ascent back to 30+ VIX with CPI and FOMC being the fear inducing catalysts. However, if tomorrow they unwind it further I will be looking for 20 VIX and will be anticipating that CPI on Friday will start the spike of the VIX. My working theory is that MM are unwinding the VIX slowly but surely without really bumping SPY up all that much in order to all the VIX to properly spike during CPI and FOMC. If they hadn’t unwound the VIX then CPI and FOMC would almost certainly give us VIX 40+ and SPY sub 360. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday I went ultra-conservative and honestly I kinda enjoyed it. I made a few mental “entries” today that were aggressive (and definitely not following my trading method above) and all of them got burnt to crisps. So going heavy conservative and getting a W today felt great. I missed the morning run and the last thing I wanted to do was FOMO into SPY today. The mid day was set up till about 1230 for a massive dump back to where we opened but all of a sudden at 1230 we got a massive volume spike which subsequently led to 415.74 EOD. \n\nI also took profits quicker then I would have liked to today as I felt the 3dtes were getting massively theta burned and IV crushed to the point where there was little reward to the risk. All three of these positons went on to see 20-30% if not more gains, however, with the IV crush, theta burn and overall lack of trust in this market I took profits when I could and was happy to sit the sidelines today. Profits are profits. Came in at 69% of daily goal today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bktf5kx5oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f83d02f6ca386bb71c90d4634783a489738399\n\nAnd for those of you wondering how I can comfortably cut a position size in 1/5th this is what I would say. Whether you are trading 1k or 5k nothing should change. You should make the same entries and same exits. Your risk should be the same. Nothing is changing in my methology of trading, however, I am just taking the risk of position size off the table. I am eliminating one variable till I feel we are at a place where I can re-enter full position size wise.'), ('AAPL announcing its entrance into the BNPL market', 'AAPL announcing its entrance into the BNPL market'), ('spy', 'spySPY CAN GO EITHER WAY....WANTS TO RALLY...WANTS TO TANK...EVERYONE WAITS ON INFLATION NUMBERS FRIDAY...INFLATION PEAKS..SPY RALLYS ...INFLATION RISES...SPY TANKS....I MADE MY MOVE ...WHATS YOUR MOVE?'), ('Buyer’s Remorse: NIO Gets Cold Feet and Abandons Its Partnership With AMD Just Two Days After the High-profile Announcement', 'Buyer’s Remorse: NIO Gets Cold Feet and Abandons Its Partnership With AMD Just Two Days After the High-profile Announcement'), ('6-8-22 SPY Daily TA', '6-8-22 SPY Daily TADespite probably one of the most uneventful and boring days ive ever seen on SPY today was a great day and also showed us quite a lot in my opinion. For the first 3 hours of the day SPY maintained the same $3.1 range that was established within the first 30 minutes of trading. The best opportunity of the day was the 1230 dump. From there we just consolidated within a $2.35 range the rest of the day. Overall an extremely uneventful and extremely boring day to trade. Pretty much all but about 30 minutes of the day was untradeable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcjhazrhbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c00dc5253e6821152f32d2a1d875194243d75411\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac84l37ibh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60570d930b71bbc6bed47c6cadaab54c138185ef\n\nWhen we look at the daily chart I think the party is about to be over. We have a couple things forming here. We have that blue triangle which you can see we peaked on June 2nd at 417.44. From there we have now established a lower highs resistance line that has been rejected 4 times including today. In addition highlighted in a red dotted pattern you can see a VERY large ascending wedge which I anticipate we will break tomorrow and will lead to the downfall where we will see a retest of the 390s at minimum over the next 2 or 3 weeks. \n\nWe also maintained that purple channel that I believe we will eventually see support break on it and that will be the time to play some longer dated puts. I think that time is coming very soon. \n\nI fully expect us to revisit 408 support tomorrow at a minimum if not lower closer to 405. Currently 406.4 is the support line of the current sideways channel (406.4 to 416.6). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5kiimo0jbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36e03677135d5eb17c2df677918483e7ccb27d34\n\nOn the weekly we are seeing nearly a triple top (double top for sure) at 416. As long as SPY doesn’t close over 416 this week I fully anticipate the weekly to break that support line at 406.5 next week if not this week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/stnadtzjbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a22e2d869d89f39e94443e26e044323df73c2ce0\n\nI mentioned that the VIX was approaching its crucial support line yesterday in my TA and today I mentioned in my server that 23.8 was the key to watch. Well the VIX bounced right off 23.74 today and EOD failed to unwind back under 23.8 closing just below 24. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o27nlenkbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286dc30095dd029ac5088285f7a5e2cc05b4bac7\n\nI will be looking for the VIX to start its way back toward 30 tomorrow. With CPI coming only two days away now I suspect markets are going to start getting the fear back in. There has been a lot of chatter about this CPI and a lot from fed members to the point I think we are going to see a bigger miss then expect on CPI. I would be surprised to not see some of that fear set in tomorrow. I will be looking to see the VIX end of day near 25.5 and start its ascent up to 30 Friday and Monday next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojs3am9lbh491.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c202e0ad543621988fb095091d23f9d549e70354\n\nLooking at the last few CPI releases you can see that surprisingly the last 4 of 5 CPI eves actually were green days with 2 of them being significantly green. However, the April 12th CPI we had a massively red day. Looking at the VIX trend For the April 12th CPI we actually saw the vix the week leading to CPI rise from 18.8 to 25. The May 11th CPI we saw the VIX go from 29 to 33 the day of CPI. Interestingly enough looking at the VIX trends 7days prior to CPI this is the first CPI we have seen the VIX unwind leading to CPI. We have over the last really month (actually the last CPI on May 11th) seen the VIX steadily unwind down to where we are not at 23.95. \n\nWe have seen the VIX go from peak of 37 on May 2nd to current day at 23.95 and SPY has only gone from 380.54 (may 20th) to 417.44 (June 2nd) a 9.6% bull run. Oddly enough the same time it took the VIX to go from 34 (March 9th) to 24 (March 22nd) Spy also moved about 9% going from 415.12 to 450.58. \n\nI have two working theories. The first is that the fed and markets know CPI is finna be trash and its finna scare the fuck outta the market. We then have a follow up FOMC meeting only 3 trading days later. With these two major VIX spiking catalysts I have a theory that they purposefully have been slowly unwinding the VIX knowing come Friday, and next week the VIX is gonna rocket again and they don’t want the VIX over 40+ yet and they don’t want SPY back under 380 yet. \n\nMy second theory is we are going to see a great CPI and a reassuring fed on Wednesday at FOMC. If that were to happen we could see the VIX unwind the rest of the way from 23 to 18 (just like the March rally and VIX unwind). \n\nIn March we saw the VIX go from 34 on March 9th to 19 on March 29th which moved SPY from 415.12 to 462.07. 11.3%. If the VIX continues to unwind we could see the last 4% of the rally which would bring us up to 424 range. Oddly enough this tracks with one of my major daily resistance lines perfectly. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pi5ibi6mbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a017899cb053a14705b8737d4ce1e24f92625a87\n\nDo I think we see 424 at this point? No I really don’t. I really favor that we are going to get a CPI that’s comes in over expectations (currently consensus is 8.3%). \n\nLast CPI we saw them for the first time predict that inflation has essentially peaked saying we would see 8.1% instead of the previous 8.5%. We DID see a “peak” with a 0.2% decrease from 8.5% to 8.3%. They are now calling for that same number of 8.3%. Now if and when this CPI misses not only is it a miss of expectations its also confirming that inflation has NOT peaked which is a major deal. I predict we come in somewhere near 8.4-8.5%. \n\nIn the off chance we DO see 8.2% or lower that would be a major catalyst for the markets though as it would confirm for 2 months in a row that inflation has “peaked.” Now of course in reality if we look at the world its bullshit there aint no way anythings peaked… But of course they look at the numbers how they want to… \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was actually a GREAT day. I didn’t make my first trade till 1230 on that big drop. I stuck strictly 100% without wavering to my 5 of 5 in agreement momentum indicator and let me tell you she did not disappoint! It saved me from taking 3-4 trades that I would normally have entered. However, EOD when we were attempting to breakout during power hour it was showing 5 of 5 bullish. However, that’s where the overall trend of the day and relationship to the 8ema and comes into play hugely. IT was against trend so I couldn’t bring myself to enter the trade and im glad I didn’t as it obviously came back down… \n\nMy only red trade today was an apple trade I attempted to enter in congruence with my SPY trade at 1230ish. It never saw about 3% and I closed when I closed my SPY put for profits. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv48qmvmbh491.png?width=755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6ad6871946a8fe5792d224bee1b9ee423b43d37\n\nI decided to go ahead and enter some puts over night tonight. I think even if we open green that we will see at minimum 407 tomorrow intraday. However I favor us opening under the daily 8ema of 410.92 and braking down most of the day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73ajjidnbh491.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da42e5d21d9f964d8e89812c3ae23c7343141ade')], '2022-06-09': [('#RocketMan 🚀🚀🚀 is claiming that he has Diamond Hands and still wants to close on $TWTR!?!', "#RocketMan 🚀🚀🚀 is claiming that he has Diamond Hands and still wants to close on $TWTR!?!Elon Musk made tendies on the $TSLA shares he dumped and he's still Diamond Hands on this $TWTR stonks.

The split sounds like it should be done by fall. So, the play is therefore to simply buy up November or October calls at $1262, or you could buy a bit lower to make sure it\'s ITM, call it $1200.\n\nI made jokes about this last time, and everyone thought I was being a moron, but had I actually done the trade I would\'ve made 100x because the stock did in fact rally tremendously LAST time this happened, and crossed 420. Because past results are often a prediction of future performance\\*, we can expect TSLA stock to end up north of $420.69, since that is the nature of things.\n\nGood luck losing money on this truly moronic idea based in no valid reasoning.\n\n\\*many exceptions always apply'), ("TA is easy.

Shortly afterwards, the consumer sentiment number came in at a record low of 50.2, down 14% from May. The FED meets next week and apparently 75 basis points may be on the table (it should). Oh, and the first big chunk of assets from the FED\'s balance sheet is going to roll off on the 15th, resulting in god-knows-what reaction in the bond markets?\n\nThe economic turmoil is just getting started and there doesn\'t appear to be any signs of things changing. Looking over the CPI report, the numbers are way worse than even the headline number suggests. May came in at 1% m/o/m, signaling that double digit inflation may be in our future. The food category was up 1.2% for the month and many segments are showing mid teens increases y/o/y. A third of the overall weighting of the CPI is shelter, which is ridiculously underreported at 5.5%. Average rents have gone up 15% and home prices 20% in the last year. What would this number look like if properly calculated???\n\nConsumer sentiment has always been more of a "soft" economic number, given that it is based on feel rather than hard numbers. But a decline that puts the figure below both 2008 and 1999 is nevertheless  startling. When you add anecdotal evidence to the equation it becomes even more real. Layoffs, hiring freezes and recinided jobs offers are just a portion. People are pessimistic about housing purchases, gas prices and energy costs, to name a few. The thing about sentiment is that it can become powerful enough to actually change the more hardened economic numbers. If people feel that everything is more expensive, they may feel poorer and spend less as a result, even if their budgetary reality is not as bad as it seems. It can become a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nAnd then there are the financial markets. Despite the recent beatings that most financial instruments have taken since the end of last year, QQQ and SPY are still about 20% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Keep in mind that we are currently in a highly inflationary period at the start of a rate hike cycle, with the FED beginning to unwind its massive balance sheet, unlike pre-pandemic. There still appears to be a lot farther that asset prices can fall.\n\nThe reason that these issues aren\'t going to go away anytime soon is due to (my new favorite term) "excessive savings." This term has popped up quite a bit recently and refers to the amount of savings that households have compared to the pre stimulus days. Most projections put this number in the $2 trillion range. It\'s funny that higher savings rates are now viewed as an economic problem. On the one hand, it is this cash that has helped spur the inflation that is currently devouring purchasing power. On the other hand, this "excess" cash is going to keep inflation higher for longer as people spend down their savings until they reach a level of discomfort that causes them to pull back.  That may take awhile. \n\nTo add one more ingredient to the shit sandwich that we are staring down, how much leverage is there actually being employed in our financial markets? We all got a deserved laugh at Bill Hwang blowing up billions using ridiculous leverage in his opaque family office dealings.  His mentors at Tiger Global Management are down 50%, making one wonder what type of risk they have on their books. Elon leveraged his TSLA shares to buy Twitter. Michael Saylor from MSTR leveraged a balance sheet full of fake internet money to get loans to buy more fake internet money. The big guys are doing these types of things, but what about the small fish?\n\nThere was a hilarious post the other night about someone who sold their house and instead of paying cash for the next property, they put a big chunk in stocks and took a margin loan against their portfolio to pay for the place. After 5 weeks of declines, they were facing a $250k margin call that they couldn\'t meet.  Who knows if this is even true, but we see actual examples of this stuff in the daily financial news pretty frequently with the big fish. How many little fish are leveraged to the hilt?\n\nLong story short, we are facing historically high inflation, rising interest rates, quantitative tightening, plummeting consumer sentiment, falling markets and potential issues that haven\'t even come to light yet.

Control the inflation by going full Volcker before inflation hits 20% or let inflation run hot while waiting to see if QT, opening up of supply chains, and war ending might give us some relief. I am assuming that Feds will do what Volcker did in 70’s and I think it is probably the best-case scenario for US in the long run.

Some people are not realizing how bad the 8.6% CPI report was... the highest analyst estimate was 8.5%.  Our government is not being honest about the current economic situation (not that I would expect them to be).  The federal reserve has been consistently wrong about inflation over the past 2 years.  There is one thing that they are being honest about, inflation needs to be brought down fast.  Jerome Powell already knows he needs to save reserve currency status and bring down inflation as fast as possible.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/l99m90dxx0591.png?width=1479&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ac8bd7ba32d355e0f2708a9f72cac2a26df7b74)\n\nThe bond market has always been a very good indicator of what the federal reserve will follow for the effective rate.

There are 2 possibilities for next week when Jerome Powell decides how much to raise rates (Purple Line - 75bp rise, Blue Line - 50bp rise).  At the current 6-month yield a 50bp rate hike would equal a 46bp spread from the 6-month yield.  I think the federal reserve will be watching what the equity markets are anticipating... shown above if the 6-month price continues to drop and the yield increase to around 2.23% then I will say there is a 99% chance of a 75bp rate hike.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9tgyaf931591.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7de398e8afd784af07e63ebfbd7d1bb8210fd65\n\nThe 30Y - 5Y bond yields were also inverted this week,  the bond market always shows the economy's health... and right now it is warning of a recession.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pht8ks04a1591.png?width=1362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ca461acebd5b28e07faafee5ef19ef14c0773ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vuqefvpv41591.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3c37c9a7bb6d75c89c0c0da0e6871a296c2d1b2\n\nAnother problem is that our government thinks the economy is strong, this is because consumers keep spending and spending.

Part Deux[Part One here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v6hr7e/what_will_happen_with_our_economy/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\nIn summary from part one is that the supply-side driven inflation will not subside in the near term regardless of Fed intervention even while people suffer an affordability crisis.\n\nHere we examine the timelines, the global impact and the future.\n\nThe last couple years have been a free money bonanza.  Government flooding the economy with Benjamin\'s.  Savings going up.  ChaChing on nearly every move by every autist.  It\'s been a money utopia.\n\nThat has changed.  \n\nThe stock market as the predictor of the economy started down first peaking in late fall 2021.  It was obvious (I believed) there was going to need to be a reset of values as inflation picked up heat for the first time in over 15 years.\n\nBut where is the real bottom?  \n\nNo one knows, but we can figure out some information.\n\n\n\nLet\'s first look at energy, mainly oil. \n\nAs a result of the 2020 shit storm oil prices and push for green energy, there has been little investment from oil companies into any new projects.  CAPEX has been slow to increase due to the perceived risks in the future of oil as well as the losses from the oil boom the closed many tight oil wells in 2020 in the US.  Many oil companies are sitting on lots of cash or issuing divis to shareholders with the money.\n\nSo supply is not expected to increase that much.  Demand will continue though for the forseable future.  Electric cars won\'t have that much impact for at least the next 5-10 years.\n\nTherefore, it cannot be expected that oil prices will tank UNLESS demand drops so production exceeds supply.  \n\n\n\nSecond, let\'s look at food.\n\nFood prices have skyrocketed, well beyond any bullshit 8.6% lying non-sensical non-sense idiotically stupid fuckin numbers.  Did I make my fuckin point?\n\nWhy?  Cause ALL the input costs and transportation costs have risen. Fertilizer, pesticides, energy, labor, blah blah blah.  Well demand for food is not subsiding. I give you my Chuck Barkley GUARANTEE.  \n\nSo as more countries take protectionist stances against exporting critical commodities to make food (fertilizer, wheat, corn), this causes a restraint in supply and continued upward pressure.  \n\nWhy?  Because there is already a food shortage that will ONLY get worse with more protectionism of food supply.\n\nAnd these are critical ingredients for your food supply (either the grain that feeds the cow, or wheat for your bread, or the weiners for your wife).\n\nFood prices will continue up, but that kid in Africa will have even fewer crumbs.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, the last big expense: interest rates.\n\nAnd with the central banks, nearly in unison, coming out and saying they are now focusing all efforts on inflation, good fuckin luck.\n\nThey are bigger retards than WSB.  \n\nAnd if one of you fuckers say, "ok economist know it all", take your fuckin blinders off and see how fuckin wrong the dumbass Fed is EVERY FUCKIN TIME.  Transitory.  React way too slow.  Print money into oblivion.  These are the fuckers that fuck every fuckin thing up.\n\nYou get that right?\n\nSo guess what?  They gunna keep rising rates hard and fast trying to catch up and continue when that inflation BS statistic barely budges, after taking wayyyy too long.  The amount of demand they need to suppress to control inflation is beyond the Great Recession level drop. \n\nBecause we are in supply-side inflation.\n\nBut how long will it take to decrease demand if there are so many supply shortages?\n\nIt will take some time for unemployment to creep up significantly, likely not until late 2022.\n\nWe need to keep an eye on discretionary spending stocks.  Watch restaurants, some retail, Home Depot, autos, travel.  Look at revenue.  This will give you the idea of how much the consumer is hurting. \n\nUnemployment will then start to increase, but it will take some time to affect inflation.\n\n\n\nThe crazy part about this is that this is a world phenomenon.  EVERYWHERE.  Not 2008 like the US.  Not 2011 like the EU PIGS.  Everywhere is seeing inflation/hyper inflation.  Everywhere is seeing unaffordable food and energy costs (poor countries/people are way worse off).  Everywhere is seeing interest rates rise FAST.\n\n\n\nThe stock market WILL not have any substantial rally UNTIL the interest rates are seen potentially levelling off.  Bond yields will continue to increase until that point as well.  And as risk free rates continue to rise, the market values will continue to sink.\n\n\nDo NOT expect any change in interest rate policy by the Fed until at least mid Fall.  This summer is a write off if you\'re expecting a rally, but we will be able to have more direction by the end of summer.   It may even be over a year away.\n\n\nCan you make money?

I cautiously approached my phone. I don’t use Facebook/Messenger for anything other than Marketplace window shopping by the way, checking in anytime ABC7 airs surveillance footage of a group running not from a teen making good on his 4chan manifesto, but fleeing to the safety of Meta Marketplace with armfuls of Veblen goods, purloined from the racks, displays, and mannequins of luxury stores.\n\n*“Is this still available?”* The message innocently read. \n\n*“Ira!”* I called, but he was already wide-eyed staring over my shoulder, past my phone screen unimpeded, and into that ultimate secret place, which we all know is called the *portfolio*.\n\n*“Yes,”* I wrote back, visibly shaking. \n\nIra had me pull up the price of oil while he was there. WTI was trading at $122 bbl. He hissed. \n\nWhat I didn’t tell you is that I made a promise to myself in March to go long when that honey got sold. But was it an outlier? Was my tickler into the future the result of something else? Ira back then squared his shoulders and boasted he’d lever up if it sold. So here we find ourselves Ira and I small figures in a curious situation. Because this honey sale coincides closely with $280 QQQ. That’s my line in the sand. \n\nWe’re only 2.5% away from that. That was the bottom last month and it held. Will it be a double-bottom? If it doesn’t hold, I’ll go on record here, in the presence of this hardened audience and say, we’ll have a 1929 moment this summer, and it will be a Japanese financial implosion. I’m am telling you now, they can't withstand the lows that come after a break of $280 QQQ and what that decollateralizes. And since Japan is the happy buyer of the majority of our debt (China has been offloading Treasuries since 2010), such an event should set the USD like a marble ready to get fired into the parabola of hyperinflation, which I posit, China’s naval blockade of Taiwan will force. Two Decisions we’ll have to make as I talked about in a previous post China will force with their 2023 blockade:\n\n* Go to war and go hyper\n* Don’t go to war and lose the 21st century\n\nFor the prudent trader, it would seem $280 QQQ is made for the option play known as a *straddle*, whereby an equal amount of calls and puts are bought at the same strike price with the same expiration date. \n\nIf $280 breaks, then I’d assume a 50% drawdown is logical. Bear markets last an average of 289 days. A bear market is defined as a drawdown of more than 20% in any 4Q period. On the other side of this bear however, I don’t know what money or collateral will look like. More on that momentarily. \n\nIf $280 holds, then I’d expect horn gore. Complete bullish horn gore. Whatever alleles on WSB genes exist for greed will be fully expressed. We’ll challenge the ATH (not in real terms of course because of inflation) before the famine comes destabilizing the Middle-East and North Africa, before the Turkish Lira’s hyperinflation to nada and destabilization, before the resulting EU immigration crisis, Japan’s implosion, and the Taiwan blockade in early 2023. It’ll be a World War sure, it just won’t resemble any of the ones from your grade-school text book photographs. It’ll be a war of currencies, commodities, supply chains, and infrastructure. China has an enormous amount of silver. They have possibly 20x more gold than we know. Russia has a large amount of gold. China is hellbent on percolating their digital Yuan. \n\nAll of this is partly why I’m hyper-bullish on **digital** gold—**₿**, my theory being: \n\nA REVERSE 6102 STYLE ATTACK\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xkjhv04vx2591.jpg?width=444&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a2574dd63b5e8de4db477b82d496fade707d6a9\n\nYes, goldbugs will take it from the other end this time. If things get out of control (really out of control), then the West could presumably defund their enemy’s ambitions by coordinating and dumping their gold on the open market. Protection would be too expensive as derivative premiums reprice upwards. It would obliterate the price of gold—permanently—and they could embrace **₿**, which the West has all the **efficient** mining and most of the hashpower for (59% renewable energy and growing rapidly), most of the nodes which actually control consensus, all the top programmers, and all of the libertarian anti-authoritarian culture. **₿**’s smallest unit could reprice, then a credit market develop around it, and it would emerge as universal collateral, whereby every discrete payment network switches to using its L2, and I’m not certain most people would know the difference in their day-to-day lives.\n\n[https://lightning.engineering/posts/2022-4-5-taro-launch/](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2022-4-5-taro-launch/)\n\nI like it in any setting. But what I like about it in a wartime setting is that it’s universal, impairment resistant, and unconstrained by borders, with the only thing required to get started being a free mobile app. It can be THE capital flight release valve anywhere for anyone and no government can stop their citizens from saving themselves or loved ones. \n\nCentralized money targets a stable price. This is a terrible system, but it must happen because it’s inflationary and centralized. So in order to maintain that stable price, you must have overwhelming intervention, tools, manipulation, collusion, and organizations to coordinate it. In many cases you need a military esp a global navy to enforce it. Even then boom &amp; bust cycles come. And eventually:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ziko3ey0y2591.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13bbd66b7aae680cb99d9ecc3abd9b50f4a54efb\n\nAnd in the blue corner you the deflationary system. **₿** doesn’t target a stable price. It targets a variable price. It can control its ledger and issuance with the one-directional entropy of energy, and the free market sets the price. When it’s absorbed enough trust (value) its confidence curve (volatility) will flatten. That’s not something humans have ever seen, and it’s probably why after it absorbs enough trust, it’ll be man’s final money. It’ll be a transparent and honest base layer. Right now our base layer is fiat and debt. This is a dishonest base layer. Nothing built over it can ever be honest. Does distortion in money equal distortion in information? Maybe that’s what this transition period will be about, getting rid of that distortion, reigning in governments. Otherwise things that work get built in layers: a human body, an atom, planet, or pizza.\n\nIn the meantime I’m going long equities. Not levered, but long. It’s at odds with much of the data I’m looking at, and doesn’t feel natural at all. If $280 breaks then I’ll help Zuck heat up and subsidize my street-faring brethren in Marketplace.\n\nWe didn’t catch anything fishing but the Torpedo made the time pass pleasantly, under a clear blue sky unwrinkled and still.

Currently as of writing this, the S&amp;P 500 has corrected down approximately ~18% from ATH. This is quite the correction, enough so that many think we may experience a rough market downturn into recession.\n\nI hear many sentiments within these posts about future projections of how this recession will take place. *”Just wait until the layoffs happen”*, *”Puts on anything are free money”*, *”CPI keeps going up it’s clearly runaway inflation”*, etc. However, all of these sentiments are based on previous recession indicators in from that had different economic situations.\n\nThe Great Depression in 1929 is still highly debated among economists of why it happened. Obviously the great stock market crash occurred at the beginning, and many different schools of economic thought describe this event as prescriptive of the depression or a consequence of the the depression. However what we do know is that stock market crash greatly reduced consumer savings, caused a lack of confidence in the financial services industry, run on banks, and eventual job losses. Ultimately what pulled out the US from depression was the start of World War II and the extreme surplus of GDP caused by wartime production.\n\n2008 was largely caused by the packaging of junk bonds and mortgage backed securities into their own basket which was rated by investment agencies as better than they actually were. Along with the abuse of derivatives by financial companies such as Lehman brothers, etc - a housing bubble was created and ultimately popped leaving the pain onto consumers while the government bailed out banks.\n\n2020 (mini COVID recession) a flight to safety occurred where money was pulled radically out of financial products due to an extreme lack of confidence in global supply chains and globalized companies due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Subsequent lockdowns caused layoffs, a decrease in consumer income, and shortages from supply chains (bull whip effect). The overall pandemic was considered bad enough that the government allowed for trillion dollars in Covid related aid as well as stimulus packages for common Americans.\n\nMany say we’re heading into another recession because of the current market sell off and a multitude of factors such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, runaway inflation, and Shanghai lockdowns for Covid. Overall, things look pretty bad.\n\nBut, and many will roll their eyes at this statement, the stock market is the most forward looking indicator in our entire economy. Many believe that the market is the culmination of all information related to the US economy synthesized into industries and indexes with dollar values. There is one caveat to the stock market though, it caters to the top 1%. The wealthiest 10% of Americans hold 89% of all stock holdings. \n\n#Let me repeat, the wealthiest 10% of Americans hold 89% of all stock holdings.\n\nThe covid stimulus presented an interesting thought experiment that I will walk through based on the covid recession and why the stock market behaved as it did. After the crash, many of us believed it would take years for the sp500 to return to its previous levels, however looking at the chart, in a span of roughly 6 months we were back at ATH. I truly believe much of this upward price movement was due to the stimulus checks given during COVID and the large amount of quantitative easing by the federal reserve. Additionally, inflation was rising back then, and don’t forget equities and financial assets are affected by inflation just as much, if not more by the increase in prices.\n\nNow we’re in a period where the federal reserve is reducing treasury holdings, and high inflation is reducing consumer savings so they have less to invest. However, high inflation does not affect the top 10% of incomes in America. They simply reduce the amount of luxuries they spend on. We’re also in a period called the “great resignation”, where the opportunity for remote work has caused a labor shortage since high skilled workers are able to work at companies at a national scale without having to move locations. I believe this is more reasoning that we are *not* heading towards recession.\n\nWill there be job losses? Yes. But not for the people that it matters. See, everyone knows that America has been trending towards the middle class shrinking and causing a split where you are either a high income earner, or you are below the poverty level. This has increased over time due to student loans causing even middle income earners stuck living pay check to pay check from debt repayments. I believe much of the sell off is due to retail investors being pressured from high inflation to sell their savings for liquid cash to purchase gas and groceries. Don’t forget, an extra 2400 in your pocket from Covid, and more if you claimed unemployment, caused a rapid increase in retail holdings in the stock market - especially during the rise of “meme stocks”. Side bar, like bro I was in a fuckin Uber and he’s asking me about what I think about AMC or GME, like wtf. The market experienced mania after the Covid crash, with retail buying anything and everything from shitcoins, AMC, to egg future contracts with no plans to actually own the commodity. And now, retail is selling out from the need of short term liquidity to fulfill basic needs like food and gas.\n\nHowever, the top 10% of Americans aren’t as fearful as during Covid and pulling out of their 401ks or retirement funds. Financial services companies like Goldman or vanguard are actually hiring at a more rapid pace right now due to the large amount of high skilled workers looking for new jobs. The only people, as always in American, that are going to be hurt are the lowest 25% of incomes. There’s a common adage in the finance industry that says, “sell in May and go away”. After this mania occurred, market cycles still continue as normal, except normal market cycle sell offs are magnified by first time inexperienced retail investors cashing out their investments bought during the mania, in fear of losing it all and missing out on the opportunity cost of buying the goods they need to survive. I truly believe, this downswing will not last as long as we believed. Don’t forget the news will always be bearish during market downturns, but these media companies typically skew the opposite of what smart money or big money is doing in the market. I’m not saying next week SPY will go racing to ATHs again. I’m saying the combined unique scenario of pumping the average Americans wallets with Covid relief money during a time when our orange man was saying V-shaped recovery and inflation pumping equity prices may result in a normal correction - but not a recession. Despite what everyone says, the job market is actually very strong for skilled workers right now. Many of these workers are seeing 10 to 20% salary increases from switching companies. While layoffs occur, most of the higher income Americans right now are doing excellent in this economy. Which means, eventually people will buy this dip, and retail will feel left out again because they panic sold while big money and smart money laughed at them. This all goes back to my sentiment that the market has a lot of psychology involved, and the mania experienced during Covid with meme stocks and free money caused a rapid increase which obviously needed to correct down again, but don’t expect recession right away.\n\nI will say, anyone who bought leap calls during the falling knife of Covid would’ve been extremely profitable, or even just dollar cost averaging shares. My honest opinion is probably by October we’ll see a strong bull market again, but I wouldn’t be surprised to just see some large swings in both directions with an overall sideways movement in the stock market from now own. The market is going to bleed out retail and then big money is going to move in like it’s always been. My advice would be don’t be too bearish, because there will be a time when big money cycles back into equities. \n\nTLDR: high inflation hurts the lowest 25% of Americans the most. The highest 10% of incomes own 89% of stock market holdings. Labor market is strong for high skilled workers. Recession may not be imminent, but retail getting caught holding the bag definitely is.'), ('A Bear Market Manifesto', 'A Bear Market Manifesto&amp;#x200B;\n\n[the end is near](https://preview.redd.it/z1nda8m19b591.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cab48e802bd900c63e4412f9ac6c15c399b5ac9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me start off by saying, I like to write – *a lot*.

We are seeing a confluence of events that we’ve never seen before: 1970s macroeconomics meets 2001 Dot-com valuations – a lethal cocktail for stocks. No idea where the bottom will be, but if I had to guess, I would say SPX somewhere between 2,500 at worst and 3,500 at best, with the more likely outcome being somewhere in the middle around 3,000. Sub 2,500 is a possibility though. No idea when the bottom will be, but my gut says this will be a 12-24 month bear market, and we’re only in about month 6. I feel fairly confident saying it will last anywhere from 10-36 months. Long-term bear markets can get extremely choppy and can destroy new or undisciplined traders. Use appropriate instruments for appropriate time periods, i.e. buying options during increasing volatility and either selling them during decreasing or using an alternative you’re familiar with like futures or ETFs/ETNs.

But it’s questionable if Volker would have the stomach for what JPow is facing, which is nothing short of shit your pants till you die kind of scary: 1970s-style inflation meets 2001 Dot-com-like valuations. And the reason that’s so fucking scary is because in isolation, each one is problematic, but not dire. But when combined, they become a death knell for stocks – an environment that as far as I can tell, has never happened before. Let’s compare and contrast time periods to explain why. \n\n**1970s Style Price Shocks**\n\nA lot of the talk has been about how inflation is hitting levels that we haven’t seen since the 70s, and it’s true this is alarming. But what’s particularly concerning is how similar the Rate of Changes are, which are arguably more important than the absolute level when you’re talking about price shocks. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnbq7c4aab591.png?width=1933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d176568548e3d42a968416084b47ce6db5d682c5\n\nFrom trough in 2020 to the first 8 handle print in March 2022, it took just 21 months for the CPI to break out of a nearly 20-year downtrend. Look at the last time it printed an 8 handle before that, it was Oct. 1973. Pretty much same story – it took just 14 months from trough in 1972 to the first 8 handle print in Oct. 1973, breaking out to levels not seen for 20+ years since the 1950s. No, 2022 is not identical to 1973 (unemployment and labor force participation rates are different, technology, etc.), but I believe it’s similar enough that we can expect similar types of elevated and prolonged inflation. But you know what I can guarantee you isn’t similar between now and then?\n\n**The Valuations – 1973 vs 2022**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19kqmy4eab591.png?width=849&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f6a7ccf0d4d7764277e4916a1df34046580471\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3myehylgab591.png?width=1245&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e4c151d19cfa12bf32f16adf00b274b168dae87\n\nHuge difference between 1973 and today, huh? We may be facing 1970s style inflation, but at least back then the valuations were much lower. Now, regarding the Dot-com comparison; no, we are not in another *full-blown*Dot-com bubble – but we are at nosebleed valuations not relatively far off. By some valuation metrics, we aren’t at or surpassing those levels. But by others, we are indeed above Dot-com levels. But whether we are or are not isn’t the point. The point is, we’re still pretty much in the top 3 right now no matter how you spin it. We’re seeing lower lows and lower highs on the 9-month chart, coming out of the longest ever recorded economic expansion and bull market in history, at some of the highest levels in history. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to be long into that picture. It gets much worse though, because you know what else isn’t the same today as it was in 1973? \n\n**The Fed Funds Rates – 1973 vs 2022**  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84llicglab591.png?width=1164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c65cb83fe3e341baf37fc874727ca25882812767\n\nIf you didn’t just poo-barf looking at that chart, you’re a sigma chad. Scroll back up and look at those other charts again, then look at this one. That’s right, you’re understanding this correctly. The last time CPI broke out and printed an 8 handle, the Fed Funds rate was ***already at 10% - we are currently at 0.77% as of May.*** In addition**,** a good chunk of the heavy lifting had already been done *nearly 4 years before Paul Volcker* would take command of the Fed and go on to create his legend. And if what Paul Volcker did was legendary, what JPow will need to do is nothing short of Godly if he is to have similar success. By this point, you should know what my next line is going to be. That’s right, it gets worse.\n\n**CPI Rate of Change (ROC) – Dot-com vs 2022**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i65vecpqab591.png?width=1165&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1db8f3c42a8aaad56bd47283cacf33c45ca6d38\n\nSo, as I mentioned earlier, nosebleed valuations in and of itself aren’t necessarily a problem. As we all saw over the last bull market, valuations can stay stretched super high for a super long time; and they usually stay high and go higher until some event, usually an exogenous catalyst, pops the bubble. In our case in 2022, I think at this point it’s pretty much undisputable that aggressively rising rates in a market like ours that’s been saturated for nearly a decade with garbage companies going public, all on valuations using ZIRP assumptions; that a catalyst like that soundly fits the bill for something that could pop the bubble. But unlike 2022, the Dot-com environment didn’t have to contend with aggressively rising interest rates. True, inflation was ramping by the late 90s and into the pop in 2000, but it never broke out of the previous decades range, let alone multiple decades like we just have in 2022. But more importantly, by Q2 of 2000 when it was becoming evident the party was over in stocks, inflation had subsided for a full quarter. And by the onset of the economic recession in mid 2001, inflation was tanking and the Fed had the flexibility to cut rates, which they did (scroll back up and look at Fed Funds Rate chart). The Dot-com bubble was already savage, but can you imagine how much worse it would have been if the Fed was aggressively hiking? Well, we’re basically about to find out.\n\n**It Could Get Worse Than The Dot-com Bubble**\n\nThis is as scary of a FUBAR situation as it gets. Look at all the charts above and take it all in as a composite. Just look at that Fed funds chart – they are so far behind the curve it’s dizzying. Look at the valuations charts and compare them to the Fed Funds chart, look at how the last decades meteoric rise in stocks has correlated tightly with aggressive ZIRP and QE. This should help you understand how much of the stock market today has been built on ZIRP models and forecasts. This shit is going to get really, really hairy – we’ve never seen a cross-current of events like this before.\n\nDoes JPow want to tank the markets? No, of course not. But he’s facing a situation where he HAS to raise rates fast and aggressive. He doesn’t want to, but that doesn’t change the facts and it can’t change reality. It doesn’t change the fact that stock valuations are in the top 3 highest ever by most metrics, which ironically, got that high because of the Fed money printer in the first place. He can want something badly, even desperately enough, but that won’t change the fact that the only available cure for high inflation is also poison for stocks, point-blank pure plain and simple – zero getting around it. Yes, there is a ton of air underneath stocks and Powell risks causing a historic bear market, but that’s not the greatest danger in the room to him. His battle is putting down inflation, not lifting up stocks – even if the two happen to be mutually exclusive this time around. And it just so happens, they are. His best and really only tool he has to wage his battle against inflation are raising interest rates, which just so happens, will smash stocks.\n\nRead those two paragraphs again, and let that sink in. You should understand now, that this essentially means Powell *has* to tank the stock market to save the economy. The only way Powell can reign in inflation is if he hikes fast and aggressive, and hiking fast and aggressive is almost guaranteed to ravage the stock market. But if he doesn’t hike fast and aggressive, he risks inflation expectations becoming unanchored, and now you’re talking full-blown runaway inflation. Off the leash, out the yard – that dog is gone. And with Debt/GNP &amp; Deficit/GNP at historic levels…well, that’s a movie nobody’s ever really seen before. If that were to happen, *anything* imaginable and unimaginable would be on the table, so I won’t even speculate. But suffice to say, it would be spectacularly apocalyptic, and JPow and the Fed know it. That is a scenario that is, unequivocally, 100% unacceptable to them – no matter what. Cannot let it happen, will not let it happen. They will let the stock market crash 1929 style before they let that happen. \n\n**Earnings Indeed Look Like the Next Shoe to Drop**\n\n**Corporate Profits**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zrso2dczab591.png?width=1162&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37c7d7d04415551ad3e2abdb32771ca9658eb200\n\nThis chart actually looks pretty good, right? Corporate profits have gone to the moon in the last year, and this lends credence to the bull argument that balance sheets are strong. But stocks aren’t priced based on their balance sheets. They’re priced based on their growth and earnings expectations. And earnings on the whole [haven’t really been revised down much](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-earnings-expectations-51654129213) from this stratospherically out-of-the norm moonshot that is quickly looking like a blow-off top.  \n\n**Change in Corporate Profits**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkmqs0z6bb591.png?width=1165&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ec523754b0cba178ad14ba36276f117efd4053\n\nYeah, not looking so good when we peek at the change in profits instead of the absolute level, huh? What this chart is showing is that there’s already major cracks emerging in corporate margins, and it seems likely they will come under substantial duress with all of the sticky inflation inputs like China Covid, Ukr/Rus, getting Zoomers and Millennials to take shitty jobs and/or retired Boomer jobs at substantially less pay than the Boomers got, etc. Each one of which in their own right is questionable about which way it will swing. But the point is that, this is not setting up well because it boils down to a simple equation: \n\nUnchanged Margin Expectations + Margins Declining in Reality = Stocks Go Down\n\nThis equation is as true as gravity, and it’s hard to argue the inputs are looking anything but bearish. \n\n**Counters to Bullish Narratives**\n\n“The Economy is Strong”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q1w00jacbb591.png?width=1158&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b590b03bb0fba9095a87ad1f7b8d899de62d7d7d\n\nNo, it’s not – GDP just printed negative. And while that in and of itself isn’t necessarily a harbinger of recession (as we see it dipped negative a few times in the last decade during the bull market), it could be if environmental factors are not conducive to growth. Regardless, this certainly doesn’t feel like a time where you can feel confident it’s just a blip.\n\n“The Consumer is Healthy”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2dvi8pebb591.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aba299a3df03ff44499d9f354207497c158730ef\n\nNo, they’re not. Personal savings levels are falling to levels we haven’t seen *since 2014*, and it makes sense why. Look at that epic sugar rush of Covid stimulus on that chart. People had more money than they were accustomed to for a while. And has it ever been easy for anyone to go back to having less cash and enjoying life like when you had more cash? No, never. Yet, look around at previews for the summer. Fuel prices and inflation in everything be damned – the consumer feels like they’ve been caged for too long from Covid and are going to splurge the fuck out of their dumb little minds this summer. Going into what looks to be a new multi-generational cycle of inflation, this is NOT the time to be splurging savings. The consumer, like they have in most cycles (roaring 1920s stocks, tech stocks 2000, real estate 2007, etc.) is showing early signs that in classic fashion, they’re about to fuck themselves.\n\n“Household Balance Sheets are Healthy”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n384vcskbb591.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a6e32ff6fbb10d06d818f836feff9c6246df701\n\nWell, kind of. Yes, this chart does look great for the bulls. We see household financial assets towering over household debt. But when we start to inspect under the hood, it again doesn’t look good. Look at the household debt chart by itself:\n\n**Household Debt**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d29fchgobb591.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1600647a3a0dd1f48d73470853519ed2f5aee72\n\nHousehold debt is still at a record high, and has particularly accelerated since the start of 2020. But we just saw a few charts ago that personal savings are at their lowest levels since March 2014. So, if debt is at a record high, financial asset values are at a record high, but the personal savings are at a near-decade low, what’s happening? Where’s that difference coming from? The answers can be found in a few more charts, of course.\n\n**Households Have Highest Exposure to Stocks To Recorded Date**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hg0w904tbb591.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7325ec24fc283f631b41694e45e7ee754c45eefe\n\nAh, starting to make a bit more sense now, right? It gets better:\n\n**Household Equity Levels in Real Estate are Stratospheric**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1qfdfycybb591.png?width=1167&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cfc6e264f51e3ce544ced08771e082c7aa81d02\n\nYes, that chart is real. Bear or bull, you can’t argue that it’s a moonshot move we’ve seen throughout the ZIRP era. The bulls will say this is great because it gives the consumer more cushion, but that doesn’t make much sense when you think about it. We’re starting to see the picture come together here. On the one hand households have garbage cash levels, and on the other hand historically high net worth’s. But as we’ve just seen, those net worth’s are massively tied to stocks and real estate. Do you honestly believe that either of those asset classes will be able to hide from aggressively rising interest rates? Highly unlikely. It seems then, that on the surface level, this bull narrative is true, but when you inspect closer, it becomes apparent it’s really not.\n\n“Muh Stocks Are Down 50% - 70%, BTFD”\n\nThis is a classic, focusing on the left side of the chart *at the wrong time* mistake. Yes, your favorite stock is down 60% from a year ago – but a year ago, cash &amp; bonds paid nothing, and today they pay something, and almost certainly will pay more going forward. The price of your stock today can’t be compared to then, because the environment and expectations at that time, which determined the price of your stock, were different. \n\nRead that over and over until you truly understand it. Okay, now wrap your mind around this: Right now, no one has any real solid idea how much/how high those cash &amp; bonds will pay going forward – and until there’s acute clarity around that, *it’s a total fucking mystery how low your garbage SPAC stock can go, because it’s now entered a new valuation environment.*\n\n# Part 2: How It Ends\n\nSo, after all that – where does this all end? How low does the SPX go? Sorry, this is going to be a groaner, but I truly don’t know. And anyone that tells you they do is full of shit. I’ll give it my best shot though for the price. As for the length, truly no idea. I feel comfortable saying anywhere between 10-36 months, with a gut call of 12-24 months with us currently being in month 6.  \n\nFor starters, instead of looking for a price level bottom, try looking for an environment bottom. What does that look like? When in doubt, paying attention to the [metrics](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-tweets-stock-market-bubble-crash-rallies-2022-5) the Godfather himself Dr. Michael Burrleone has laid out for us is a great start. I won’t list them out here – read the article, it’s a must. \n\nBut if you absolutely must have a ballpark price level, let’s break out the crayon drawings.\n\n**Monthly SPX With 2 and 3 Standard Deviations (sigma)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ueb5d2l6cb591.png?width=1322&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cfbfff9ae2b6c48a618e01654eeb09f4cfe9f42\n\nAlright, so some of you may or may not be familiar with sigma (Bollinger Bands), but it’s basically just a statistical calculation that tells you what the theoretical bounds of something should be. For 2 sigma, the blue line, statistics tells us that the SPX should trade within that range 95% of the time. 3 sigma, the orange line, should be within 99.7% of the time. So obviously, that 3 sigma should almost never be touched, right? Certainly not 6 times in the last 20 years. How can that happen? The answer is fat tails. What you’re seeing there is the reality of fat tails meeting statistical model limitations. Markets are psychologically driven, and we as humans overshoot to the upside and downside all the time. This is all a long way of me saying I think there’s a decent chance we hit that current lower 3rd sigma orange line of 3,200ish at some point in time. Now, these are moving targets of course, and if the bear market takes a long time to grind out, these sigmas will obviously change and likely contract. It’s something I’ll be keeping an eye on. A 3,200 SPX bottom would be about a 33% decline peak to trough, which actually doesn’t seem that bad when you read the Burrleone article or look at a valuations-derived guess, which I’ll do next. However, that being said, I think it’s very unlikely that we plummet to 3,200ish right away. And if we do plummet, I think it’s almost impossible the floor will give out. The sigmas are at historically wide levels, and it seems like it would take a major black swan event to push it below that current 3rd sigma for an extended period. If it does waterfall from here to that 3,200ish area, I would be a buyer around that level (not with all my cash, obviously) to play a rip. And of course, just for kicks, here’s the 1970s – although to be fair, I don’t think it’s a good comparison. The equity markets were very different then, and at a very different place technically speaking. \n\n**1970s Monthly SPX With 2 and 3 Standard Deviations (sigma)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0v07cmu9cb591.png?width=1319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0b30f6d079c1bb23162ab4d1ca0fe4686b414f5\n\n**Very Long-Term SPX Moving Averages**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g31cz7ddcb591.png?width=1810&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7230d0d39a1226b11a14e8c43effa743f0cf6e8\n\nOkay, so I’m not normally a huge fan of moving averages. I don’t dislike them, I just think they *look* much better as support levels/zones than they actually are sometimes, especially as you go shorter in timeframe. They’re also used too much in hindsight. But on the super long timeframes like this, going back to 1990, I think they become a lot more reliable. I think this chart sets up a very interesting question as to whether or not the SPX will fall to those levels. What you’re looking at are the 100(blue), 150(white) and 200(orange) monthly moving averages for the SPX. On the one hand, we see from previous recessions and bear markets that it’s very much within the norm for it to come back down into that zone. But on the other hand, those are staggeringly low levels at 2,800 on the blue, 2,300 on the white, and 2,000 on the orange. If those were hit, that would represent a peak to trough decline of 41%, 51% and 57%, respectively. Those are hard to envision numbers, and my current thought is we don’t touch orange, just like we didn’t in the Dot-com. It’s quite possible we could get close to blue or white though. That would put us near the Covid lows, which really wasn’t that long ago.\n\n**Valuation Contraction Comparisons: 1970s, Dot-com &amp; GFC**\n\nOkay, if you read Part 1, remember those valuation charts all the way at the top? Well, here’s where it gets scarier, because they all had roughly -50% declines across all three metrics: Willshire 5000/GDP, the Shiller P/E and actual price decline. Yes, you read that right, and if you didn’t, here’s a table to visualize it (+/- 3%, using rough numbers). From peak to trough during all three bear markets: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ny4u7wthcb591.png?width=298&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e79a1e226ecc6471b9de94c092e95c59ad11ee9\n\n# Part 3: How I’m Trading It\n\n**My General Philosophy**\n\nThe bear market is here to stay in my mind, and I will be trading that trend accordingly. Selling the rips and *sparingly* buying extreme dips in my trading account. From an investment standpoint, the majority of my holdings are cash. Nothing looks good to me right now, and I’m willing to eat the inflation on my savings account rather than put it into anything, even gold. Volatility makes markets whacky, and sometimes correlations between asset classes that should be low become high. So, no, I’m not investing my life savings into anything but cash right now. I will use it to buy stocks after it becomes apparent the bottom is in, and only after that. I’m willing to miss the bottom and give up those monster rips off the lows, wherever they may end up being. For now, if I can more times than not execute correctly and grow my trading account, that’ll be good enough for me. \n\nThat being said, even though it’s a relatively small percentage of my worth, I still want to practice proper risk management. This means position sizing discipline so I don’t blow it up. This means having a strategy that I’m comfortable enough with to stick through thick and thin (because there will be epic dead cat bounces and chop). Which in my case, very generally speaking, is I’m willing to accept death by a thousand cuts, to a certain point, to try and hit a homerun and catch a massive move. That’s just me, you do you. But at the very least, whatever it may be, figure it out before you start fingering your Robinhood App like a frantic ape, watching your Wendy’s paycheck get torched.\n\nTake this next part with a grain of salt, because everyone has their own trading styles. What do I mean by trading styles? Swing, PDT, options buyer and/or seller, futures, stocks &amp; ETFs/ETNs, etc. Everyone has their own unique blend of the things I just listed, and my style may not pertain to yours in some regards. For example, I don’t really trade individual stock names much, just not my preference. For the most part, I trade S&amp;P &amp; NDX futures and buy calls/puts on SPY/QQQ. That’s too boring for some people, but it does it for me. Do what works for you, with the instruments you’re most comfortable with. \n\n**SPY Implied Volatility (IV)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3qpcj0ocb591.png?width=1790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e64435c15d21af7580e5dc97723e353425bf051\n\nIn general, I want to have more long exposure to /ES and less to long SPY calls on the rips, because sometimes rallies stall, and meanwhile that SPY IV is declining and my calls are burning. No thanks. But as I’m trying to short the dips, I want to have more exposure to long SPY puts and less to short /ES, because the SPY IV will likely be cheap if I’m early and the puts will offer a lot more upside while having to risk less. \n\nI have no idea if rips will be shallow, or dips big, etc. The market is at a pivotal point, and I’m keeping very flexible about how high or low it can go, and how fast or slow. This is where it pays to be a trader.\n\n**Positions**\n\nOkay so last Thursday (6/9) I bought SPY 6/13 401P in the morning. I held that into Friday afternoon and booked a 9 bagger. I then took half the profits and piled into QQQ 6/15 275P. I’m honestly 100% okay if I give that back to the market, but as of this writing, it doesn’t look like that will happen with /NQ down more than 1.5% tonight (6/12). That could easily change by morning though, so who knows. If it opens down big, I’ll probably sell a good chunk. But I’d like to hold at least some into the NY Fed 1-year and 3-year inflation readings Monday (6/13) morning.\n\n# Part 4: Bullish Invalidation Scenarios\n\nAlright guys, I’ll keep this one short. I’m sure your eyes are glazing over by now, and I wrote this in about 36 hours, so I’m definitely slowing down at this point. If any one of these events were to occur, I would seriously revisit my bear thesis. If multiple of them occur, I would seriously consider abandoning it altogether. They are, in no particular order:\n\n* Volatility in the CPI meaningfully declines and inflation meaningfully comes down for several months in a row.\n* Ukraine Russia war somehow ends, or Putin eats it. Although, if the later happens, don’t be surprised if there’s a lot of volatility before the moon music starts playing.\n* Earnings somehow surge enough to pacify investors about the environment. \n* Higher highs and lower lows on at least the 6-month timeframe with improving macro sentiment.\n* Trend reversal in corporate margin declines for a meaningful period.\n* Bullish Black Swan Event. Have to be prepared for anything, even things I can’t imagine, like an out-of-left field mega-bullish event, as improbable as it may be. Need to be ready if it happens, which is why position sizing and stops are so important to me.\n\nHope you apes enjoyed.

Serious drop on SPY with inflation highlights continuing to rock the boat. I personally see a bounce back coming in at the next market open considering how far we've fallen without any new news.

Demand destruction is also still quite far away as we see more and more consumption in gasoline.\n\nInterestingly enough, we're also seeing Russia ramping up oil exports from their east coast by around 20% to meet surging demand from Asian buyers and to offset the economic cost by Western sanctions. If this continues, we might see more supply inflows into the general oil markets bringing in some slight relief.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nMarkets will continue to maintain their downtrend. However, for the next day, we should see a relative jump in the markets before continuing the downtrend after FOMC. I do think the channel we are in is currently pretty solid though, so I do think if we see a massive downside break, we should see a decent bounce back up.\n\n**Feedback**:\n\nIf you guys have any feedback on how I could improve posts like these (because I do want to do more of these in the future), please let me know what you would like to see and what I could do to spice things up."), ('How will SPY close on Thursday 6/16 ?', 'How will SPY close on Thursday 6/16 ?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/vcbmfi)'), ('Hope you all have spy calls', 'Hope you all have spy calls'), ('Drunk-discussion', "Drunk-discussionHey.

Overall we saw SPY make 14 total reversals intraday today. The biggest of them was the opening hour. We saw an immediate sell off followed by a near 10mil volume 15min candle that was arguably trying to breakout only for a ¼ volume candle to come in and take us back to drill down. After that first 45minutes of movement we just saw sideways burn and failed breakout after breakout. 373 support looked extremely strong all day until PH when we broke through it only to see a fairly impressive rally EOD. Bulls really tried their EOD but failed to close SPY green. A very frustrating and untradeable day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/27s7mb0utn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d95986965d5ba89e1794343d602a3a3bbbdfbff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwbez7qutn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d52d72c284340eb039671655d25b2d3038a18e\n\nThe daily does show that we are attempting to hold 373.5 as support now. It was encouraging not seeing a massively red day today also. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzoz8shvtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2242c634c6473212631bae0df9e0b48ab979fdb\n\nThe weekly bounced right at support today. IF we get a bad FOMC tomorrow and we drill we are going to be looking at not only a massive weekly gap but we are going to break fairly large support and be looking to bounce off the weekly 200ema at 363. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5lqvw56wtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea9213e2509ea1a1665489ab13b02071bc48ff4a\n\nThe VIX was a big part of the frustration today in that it just didn’t wanna find a trend. Overall until EOD it was unwinding but once she hit that 32.1 level it rejected fairly hard and bounced causing that EOD sell off. The VIX really needs to get under 32 and look for the 20s again for the bulls to have any hope.\n\nWith FOMC tomorrow there is bound to be a lot of fuckery. Most likely we will see the morning chose a trend from 930am till about 1030am and trade sideways till about 1230pm or so when we will see it inverse itself and trend closer to opening price. \n\n2pm is when the FOMC rate hike is released. We should see a fairly significant move with that. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f175tlywtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e544028dd690f3bd3b3dbf409b59b06c1e61217\n\n  \n This was last FOMC as you can see at 2pm with the rate hike we were fairly indecisive forming a 15minute doji… JPOW started talking at 230pm. Markets found their bottom and from their rallied until close. (this way May 4th FOMC).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y06ylenxtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63dedce4c59778d289322a41c9f0801be1e7b87b\n\nMarch 16th same thing… we saw markets at 2pm react to the FOMC rate hike and by 230 when JPOW started talking we were finding bottom and at 245pm we were in the trend we were going to continue in and rallied till close. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rz9affmytn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b895ce71a9e491d3dbf1757ec89cdba9a91aa6e2\n\n  \n Now for January we didn’t have a rate hike but I believe ole JPOW finally got scared about inflation here and scared the markets… so at 2pm when FOMC was released we saw the doji (like may 4th) and then when he started his presser at 230pm we started our downward trend by 245 we were confirmed. However this trend peaked at 3pm and then slightly recovered. I don’t really equate this January one to much since there is no expected rate hike so we really mainly should focus on May and March. \n\n2pm- March 16th( -1.01%)  May 4th ( +/- 0.5% both ways… up first then down)\n\n215pm- March 16th (+0.5%) May 4th (down 0.3% then up +0.8%)\n\n230pm- March 16th (dropped 0.3% and then rallied 1.2%) May 4th (down 1.1% then up +1.5%)\n\n245pm- March 16th (+0.5%) May 4th (+1.2%)\n\n3pm to 4pm- March 16th (+1.32%) May 4th (1.4%)\n\nMarch 16th- from 2pm open price dropped a total of 1.5% in 30 minutes then rallied 2.5% from 230pm low till 4pm close.\n\nMay 4th- from 2pm open price dropped a total of 1% in 30 minutes then rallied 3.61% from the 230pm low till 4pm close.\n\nSo how do we play tomorrow? Well I would be looking for about a 1% drop from the 2pm candles opening price so say we open the 2pm candle tomorrow at 375 look for 371.25 as a 230pm bottom. From there you can expect about a 2.5% to 3.6% green rally. \n\nSo you could either open a straddle with 0dte and about 3-5OTM strikes (do this at like 155pm) set the take profits on both to 30-50% and i would be shocked not to see both of them fill. Or you could open both and set 100% take profits on both and play it that way. One of them is almost guaranteed to hit 100% and then the other will be free. Most FOMC meetings you can easily turn 50-100% profits a few different times. \n\nAnother way to play it and probably the better way to play it is to wait till about 230pm for a bottom (or top I guess) and buy an option then. Most likely after 230pm we will see a great move one way or another. I would look for the VIX as a guide for this too if VIX is rocketing and you are thinking calls you are wrong… but if VIX is unwinding and you are thinking calls then you are right. By 245pm we should have a fairly clear direction and you should be safer to enter a play. \n\nFor me I will be waying my options of a 30% take profit straddle placed at 159pm and then I will look for a play at the bottom near 230 to grab a fairly OTM option on to ride till at least 3pm. \n\n10% challenge- \n\nOverall a fairly frustrating day. I took some calls at 10am when we looked to breaking out and everything look fairly bullish. But of course those got wrecked pretty quickly. I had planned to hold those till tomorrow thinking we would see the big green rally but once we lose 373 EOD I knew my hopes of seeing a green close for those were low and I took the L. I played a few scalps last 45minutes that all pretty much washed eachother out. Looking forward to tomorrow and FOMC being over and hopefully we get some clearer trend and momentum days. Overall there was just zero follow through today and by time momentum was confirming a trade it was reversing already. These sideways VIX days are brutal. \n\nToday was a good day of patience and recognizing when the setups aren’t working in your favor. Sitting cash sometimes is the hardest thing we do and not FOMOing into every play. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2axheei1un591.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97b47ce2055cd19205a8061baf8bc389e3ef4c4e\n\nSitting cash gang overnight.

But I can honestly say I highly doubt ill miss much in the morning as I suspect it to be very sideways.'), ('What are SWAPS, and how does it move the market?', 'What are SWAPS, and how does it move the market?I want to preface this post with an observation I have made recently regarding swaps and perfect hedging between certain \'meme\' stocks. In these posts, the author attempts to show why two stocks are perfect hedges against each other by showing charts that illustrate positive correlation between market cap, delta change, and suspect runs by one or the other.\n\nThe FUD that has been going around is regarding GME and AMC, so I will address that example in this post.\n\nOn initial read, these posts are quite convincing, but when combined with a bit of logic, they fall apart. It is a great logical fallacy to have a predetermined conclusion and search to find data correlations to support the expected outcome. There will always be data to support any predetermined outcome if you can illustrate it in the correct manner. (This is very present in cults, or extremist groups)\n\n\u200b\n\nNow for SWAPS... By definition "A swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange sequences of cash flows for a set period of time."\n\nSee below for reference.  I will quote this page multiple times:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/07/swaps.asp\n\nNow what makes a swap beneficial to be a participant in? "Consider a bank, which pays a floating rate of interest on deposits (e.g., liabilities) and earns a fixed rate of interest on loans (e.g., assets). This mismatch between assets and liabilities can cause tremendous difficulties. The bank could use a fixed-pay swap (pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate) to convert its fixed-rate assets into floating-rate assets, which would match up well with its floating-rate liabilities."\n\nWell that is for banks, but what about stocks? If one party has risky assets but needs to take a low risk position, they swap their risky assets with a lower risk security or bond with another participant that willing to accept the higher risk.\n\nOne critical piece of swaps is that the party accepting the risk of a security does not "own" that security. Short reporting requirements require a shorts to be reported if they are &gt;5% of the float of the stock. If a SHF wants to short a company  into the ground, they can go short 4.9% and then swap with 19 other counter parties, each at 4.9% short to be near 100% short on the stock. None of this has to ever be reported. The only reporting required is that a swap between the securities took place, which conveniently has been held from the public.\n\nAccording to https://www.sec.gov/swaps-chart/swaps-chart.pdf\n\n\'Security based swaps\' are reported to the SEC, while the CFTC regulates \'swaps\'. One key difference between the reporting is that the SEC does not require valuation reporting.\n\nhttps://www.kaizenreporting.com/sbsr-sec-swap-reporting-the-long-journey/\n\nNow back to the GME/AMC perfect hedge theory.\n\n"A perfect hedge is a position by an investor that eliminates the risk of an existing position, or a position that eliminates all market risk from a portfolio. Rarely achieved, a perfect hedge position needs to have a 100% inverse correlation to the initial position."\n\nFor a perfect hedge, the losses in one would need to be perfectly paired with the gains in the other.  A simple glance at the chart and this is obviously not the case. In fact, it is the INVERSE of a perfect hedge. The two stocks are most likely involved in something called \'bucket swaps\', where a group of securities are lumped together by risk index and swapped with another bucket with a different risk index. Both stocks were likely over shorted (along with several others) by using these bucket swaps for a long time. The benefit of lumping multiple stocks together in a bucket also goes back to reporting requirements. Lumping multiple stocks into a bucket obfuscates the value of each stock in the bucket and reporting for bucket swaps is good as useless. The participants can swap buckets back and forth with nobody besides the participants ever knowing what is contained in the buckets.\n\n\nI cannot find any stocks with near perfect inverse correlations to our favorite bucket stocks, so they are likely swapped with an alternate form of currency, or are hidden in the much larger and more stable blue chip stocks...\n\nThe swaps market is so large that in 2019, the notional amount was over 341 TRILLION.  In comparison the global GDP currently is 84.71 Trillion.  Leverage much????\n\nI will conclude this with my theory that GME and the other \'meme\' stocks are mostly lumped in a swap agreement called Equity swaps, and are lumped into multiple different baskets as well to include popular indices (could this be a large contributing factor to why everything follows the SPY???  Probably above my pay grade...).\n\nHere\'s what equity swaps are:\n\n"An equity swap is similar to an interest rate swap, but rather than one leg being the "fixed" side, it is based on the return of an equity index. For example, one party will pay the floating leg (typically linked to LIBOR) and receive the returns on a pre-agreed-upon index of stocks relative to the notional amount of the contract.\n\nIf the index traded at a value of 500 at inception on a notional amount of $1,000,000, and after three months the index is now valued at 550, the value of the swap to the index receiving party has increased by 10% (assuming LIBOR has not changed). Equity swaps can be based upon popular global indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 or Russell 2000 or can be made up of a customized basket of securities decided upon by the counterparties."\n\n\nSwap reporting requirements can be found at the link below... but it is written using legal jargon that makes it near impossible for the average person to make any sense out of.\n\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2020-11-25/pdf/2020-21569.pdf\n\n\nI am completely open to anybody disputing my theory or adding to anything I missed. If you want to argue any points, I would love to go at it. Please give supporting documentation if you disagree with any of my statements.\n\nTL;DR - that sucks, I guess you will never know what swaps are.'), ('I told you. We all told you. We all knew.', 'I told you. We all told you. We all knew.I fucking told you. We all told you. We all knew.\n\nMan a little while ago I got flamed in a comment section by saying I can see SPY going as low as between $275.00 to $375.00, with $275.00 being the extreme and $375.00 being easily achievable, and $350.00 being smack in middle.\n\nI’m not here to pretend like I know what the fucking market is going to do or that I called something out etc. because obviously no that makes no sense.\n\nBut all I wanted to say is to whoever read that comment and said to themselves, “This guys an idiot, he doesn’t know what the fuck he’s talking about”, well you would be correct.\n\nBut, SPY did close at $375.00 today, Jesus Christ 😂'), ('Daily Commentary (June 13/14, 2022)', 'Daily Commentary (June 13/14, 2022)Hey tards, I\'m going to try to create my own diary/commentary with you guys to hold me accountable with my thoughts and beliefs. \n\nAnyways, without further ado...\n\n**General Markets:**\n\nThat was a rough day in the markets. Serious drop on SPY with inflation highlights continuing to rock the boat. I personally see a bounce back coming in at the next market open considering how far we\'ve fallen without any new news.

Absolute resistance does exist around the 17k line on XXX, because if they lose that, you\'ll see a massive liquidation with funds. \n\n**Commodities:**\n\nToday\'s focus for me is oil - because despite the relative decline in tickers such as $CVX, $XOM, and others, we still have extremely tight markets with more and more SPR gasoline drawdowns. Demand destruction is also still quite far away as we see more and more consumption in gasoline. \n\nInterestingly enough, we\'re also seeing Russia ramping up oil exports from their east coast by around 20% to meet surging demand from Asian buyers and to offset the economic cost by Western sanctions. If this continues, we might see more supply inflows into the general oil markets bringing in some slight relief. \n\n**TLDR:**\n\nMarkets will continue to maintain their downtrend. However, for the next day, we should see a relative jump in the markets before continuing the downtrend after FOMC. I do think the channel we are in is currently pretty solid though, so I do think if we see a massive downside break, we should see a decent bounce back up. \n\n**Feedback**:\n\nIf you guys have any feedback on how I could improve posts like these (because I do want to do more of these in the future), please let me know what you would like to see and what I could do to spice things up.')], '2022-06-15': [('Will I make money?

YAY us! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcza2mzn2v591.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c9e930a6af81d607e6476bdebf453c0294cd0f\n\nOkay I posted this trade breakdown last night as my anticipation of how to play FOMC today and then I posted this breakdown of where SPY should move intraday. Lets see how we did…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jbuw9lo2v591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1d4e85d577314d58f6ae025ba4921f841473eb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1iuygw2p2v591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53124fd369f1851f244bc6ccc4c7fb8f61a665d3\n\nWe fake ripped to 379.98 (0.48%) and then dropped by 230pm 372.12( 1.6% from 2pm candle open) and then we rallied to 383.9 (3.1%) from 230pm till EOD. This thing played out almost exactly as anticipated. \n\nFor me I was able to capitalize on call bought on the 230pm run up when JPOW started talking. I got nervous and didn’t buy in at 372 like I told myself I would buy at the low made at 235pm and watched my qued call go up 50% before my eyes in about 5 seconds. I bought in around 375 and rode some 378C up. I had initially set a 100% take profit order but got nervous of a massive recoil on that nearly 2% candle (which did end up happening the next candle) and went ahead and set a 10% trailing stop loss when I was up 80% unfortunately due to volatility it triggered and hit me with a 56.5% gainer. While still amazing… I left a lot on the table. BUT I protected myself from downside loss which is most important being that this was a full port (hehe oops), however, had I waited about 15 seconds longer my 100% take profit would have triggered. \n\nAlso I mentioned in my night TA I was going to PAPER TRADE a strangle to see how that behaved. Both positions were opened at 130pm and by 2pm I would have been able to close both for 25% gains. I also saw both positions hit 50-60% profits but that was it. \n\nNext FOMC I will be playing a strangle with 5 OTM strikes with 30% TP set at open. I will then wait until 230pm when JPOW starts talking for the bottom/ top to be in and enter calls or puts. \n\nyou know whats really wild... the fact that the feds actually leaked exactly what they were going to do before the meeting... i mean thats nuts they are that scared of the market crashing that they went ahead and leaked the plans during a fed quiet time so that the markets could price it in...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6oh6lwp2v591.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37cfc97a22e7136a3829764a5795d315b1c91c7a\n\nThe one funny thing about todays HOD… is that it was 8 cents away from getting SPY out of a bear market, however, we hard rejected there and never made a new high or even retested it. So where does this all leave us?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2v3a1vdq2v591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2df949354b26c8bdb60debc7e417730e4bf29cf\n\nWe now actually have a symmetrical triangle which is known as a breakout/ breakdown pattern forming on the daily. With back to back DOJIs and today technically being considered a dragonfly doji (bullish) then we might actually be in store for some further upside here. Today we did chip away at $2.09 of the $7.89 gap that was left on the daily. \n\nWe now have a $5.66 and a $5.80 gap left on the daily to be filled. The $5.8 is the closest gap at 389.75. There is a pretty good case here that SPY could fill that gap tomorrow which would require a 2.78% green day tomorrow which is definitely gonna be hard to do and would require the VIX to unwind from 30 to 25 minimum to do it. \n\nThe one thing I am watching on the daily is that the Monday candles body stopped at 380 which makes it a resistance line to watch. Yesterdays candle failed to close above that resistance and today we also failed to close above it. This is a tough spot to be in as there is an equal case to be made that we break through 380 to gap fill tomorrow and there is an equal case that we partial gap filled today and will retest support down near 370 on the daily. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5j91uvwq2v591.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d4a983d66ef2f1bc58f85d305bdc467ead5afd7\n\nNow if we factor in previous CPI data it is about a 66% chance we open red and see a red day tomorrow.

If you\'re like me, you are getting paid nothing at a job that you are gonna lose by the end of July, yet you still dump all of your measly pay stubs directly into the market like the degenerate gambler you are.  Some may call it irresponsible, I call it making lemonade out of the most bitter of lemons. \n\n**The lemons:**\n\nWe all know a recession is coming. We all know inflation will not stop with these pathetic 75 bp hikes. We all know that the housing market will crash. We all know that the stock market will crash. The fun and games from 2021 are over. Historically, retail traders get absolutely fucked under these conditions, and at the end of the boom bust cycle, the rich get richer as they extract wealth from the retail bagholders. This will happen no more. While yes, food and gas are beginning to become unaffordable and it seems like the end is near, I like to stay glass half full. **I aim to turn this "once in a lifetime" market turmoil into an event of massive wealth creation, and you should too.**  My plan has 4 main phases which I will list below.\n\n***THE LEMONADE:***\n\n**Phase 1: Accumulation (UVIX)--** Currently, I am in phase one of my plan: **buying as many shares of leveraged volatility products as possible.** Since Jan 2022 we have seen much market volatility. Although the market has sold off 20%, there has not been a large move on the VIX. This is not concerning to me. It seems to be indictive of organized selling and exiting from institutions. This has given me time to buy UVIX and UVIXY on the dips as they oscillate during the sell off. Looking at 2008 this same set up can be seen. VIX did not move much at all as the S&amp;P sold off 20%. It was not until the capitulation when VIX spiked. When will capitulation occur? I\'m not sure, but I am damn sure that I will have all the capital I can spare in volatility products when the day comes. I will begin to sell when VIX cracks 50, but my price target is 60+ or possibly 70s.\n\n**Phase 2: Bridging the Gap (SVXY)--** So VIX pops off, now what? Well if you look at the graph below, VIX spikes 4 whole months before the S&amp;P bottoms. So the question is, what do I do with all my gains from the volatility squeeze? I can\'t just have them sitting around uninvested. Answer: SVXY. SVXY is a leveraged inverse VIX etf. As VIX drops from the 60s to the 30s I can make an over 50% return by buying and holding SVXY until the market finally bottoms. This will allow me to make money while I wait to buy the REAL dip \n\n[Capitulation in 2008, VIX did not spike until well after an S&amp;P bear market.](https://preview.redd.it/7ivzxihz6f791.png?width=3781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39d19e97ca69310bc92cc801fded758cea87f247)\n\n**Phase 3: Buying the REAL Dip (SPY)--**  S&amp;P Price target? See burry tweet below. Once I buy SPY, I will finally be able to rest, as the previous steps will require extreme stress and paying more attention to the market than any autist should.\n\n[Barring a miracle, I will not consider buying the S&amp;P until it nears 2000.](https://preview.redd.it/iolvthqj7f791.png?width=1625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b763c3f2c10fb782ccc3c5b514f0353c946c9ac3)\n\n**Phase 4: Own Real Assets (Buy a House)--** Honestly getting tired of typing at this point. We all know that for each % increase in the federal funds rate, housing prices drop by like 10-20% or some bullshit. On top of this, the housing market moves much more slowly than the equities market, so I will have ample time to shop around after the slow inevitable decline of the housing market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never thought owning a house would be in the cards for me (especially after I lost all my GME gains betting against Tesla).

Well we closed at 378 which is bullish as we finally got away from those 375 closes and closed over resistance. However, thanks to that mid day dump we didn’t get the 380 run and close over that I was hoping for to feel confident in a bull run tomorrow. \n\nAs you can see I have highlighted the May 12th to May 17th daily candles which look oddly similar to the current June 17th to June 23rd candles. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f3tkie2wwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbf2313ea9a297c10dbbf548ef7831138c6b03f9\n\nI am watching this closing as a hanging man daily candle which could signal the top/ a reversal. Last time we had it was on May 17th and it led to a massive -4% day with a -1.2% red open. I have my suspicions that is what we could see tomorrow. We failed once again to break through the daily 8ema today. \n\nThe blue line support from June 17th and June 22nd was broken today (I readjusted it here to see if this will be new support going forward). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38q6d9nwwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c38d838515e4c1953a152dfa664fe5f1bc3a2f07\n\nHere is the setup I am watching on the weekly and then ill lay out the bull/ bear scenario. \n\nWeekly still has the gap from 389.75 to 383.90 and as you can see major resistance is 380 and then 390. I actually was fairly bullish going into today suspecting we would break through 380 resistance and see 390 EOD tomorrow for a nice rejection and weekly gap fill to lead to downside. However that is quite the stretch now. \n\nBull case- After a bullish finish EOD today bulls look for a nice continuation tomorrow breaking through 380 resistance and close the week out somewhere in that 380 to 390 range (384 will be resistance after 380 using the June 15th candle). With a close near 384 bulls look next week to see a green week and fill the 390 gap on the weekly. If that gap fills and they can keep the momentum we MIGHT see a run as high as 400-405 next week. \n\nBear case- with this hanging man candle on the daily and struggle after struggle for bulls to keep any steam going this week. We either see a confirmed rejection in the morning at 380 or we could potentially like in May see a pretty significant gap DOWN over night and see a bleed back near 370 support to end the week. Ending the week on a bearish tone bears would look to retest the weekly 200ema and 2020 support line at 363 and attempt to break through to start the next leg down. \n\nAt this point it really is bears and bulls neck and neck. I would favor a big red day tomorrow personally. We opened the week at 371.89 so if we do see a bigger -3.4% red day tomorrow we could actually see a support test near 370 to finish the week out red. Most likely scenario is a green week finish to the week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4x94b8xwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca8200b15bd206658db12d3cacdae7d56817811b\n\nI have been trying to get a read on the VIX all week long but really cant. We have obviously unwound all week long from 34+ on June 17th to now making allow of 28.7 today but we just aren’t seeing the true unwinding of SPY like we used to on these big bull runs. We are seeing pretty much small movements followed by sideways trending all day. Overall we are pretty much dead smack in the middle of 25 and 35 for the channel with a small favor to the downside. Overall my thoughts are still that VIX wants to revisit 25 support level which would favor the 390 theory but there easily could be a pop back near 33 to 35 VIX which would favor that 370 test. Overall this market is full of mixed signals and multiple scenarios. \n\nI have said it before but even though we often are missing 1 to 1.5% moves overnight for the most part we are better off not playing swings right now. The market is just far too unpredictable and far too easily swayed to predict a true move right now. Looking back over the last three weeks that I have been tracking my swings my win rate is about 55.5%, however, the last two weeks I have spent 2-3 days recovering the losses from my swings. The first week though that swing gave me a nice reward. It’s a tough market to be in right now. On one hand we have these wild swings overnight that we can clearly capatlize on for some impressive gains IF we get the right direction and position sizing but on the other hand with the unpredictability of it and the intensity of these swings if you are wrong you are -90% wrong at open.  \n\nNow that we are on the topic of swings lets look at the last 4 weekends and see if there is a play to be made… its kinda interesting to be honest. \n\nMay 31st- -0.4%\n\nJune 6th- 1.1%+\n\nJune 13th- -2.6%\n\nJune 21st- 1.7%+\n\nAs of right now we are seeing every other week a big red then big green open… so there is a chance we open big red on Monday. Is it worth the play? Perhaps…. Gonna see where tomorrow closes us. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nI got caught in some SPY calls and UVXY puts this morning before that hard dump. I shoulda mitigated my losses but took a chance it was an over-reaction to JPOW. Waited till the bottom and averaged down the SPY calls and then the UVXY puts once I got out of the SPY calls. I missed an opportunity to take 3% green on the SPY calls but protected myself with a -10% stop loss and triggered that. Unfortunately of course it ran hard af power hour so I missed on the big gains. Overall though I salvaged a really bad day to a really great day today. But I got lucky. I should have better mitigated my losses and taken an L when I saw it go against me and saw that 11am reversal doji. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wd1cnuuxwg791.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8a14e7f9e0cd7eea2390a709621961fe7de0e7a\n\nI have had a great week after overcoming my weekend swing big loss. I am at my weekly profit goal currently and I will look to tread lightly tomorrow. Fridays are always tough days and I have seen too many Fridays erase a weeks worth of gains on a bad play.

Now we FINALLY filled the June 13th gap EOD there. Which would make me believe we are about to fill the June 10th 401.44 gap next week. \n\nIf you look at the daily I have drawn with blue dotted lines a rising wedge that is forming. This is a reversal/ bearish pattern. It gives us room to see 392 on Monday if we are obeying that resistance line. It also give us room to see 380 support test Monday to fill some of the gap we left on the daily chart today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1v8t0lium791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdce5cc1151ab394d5f29d00af09e3d4ef8f488b\n\nThe weekly gap was filled today too when we hit 390 EOD. \n\nBull scenario- What I am seeing develop is a few things here that could be bullish. In general SPY doesn’t leave gaps for too long on the daily and now that one has been filled we might fill the next which gives us the though of 402 next week. This rising wedge could actually become a smaller bull channel. If it turns into a bull channel (we would need to break through 392.5 to confirm) then we might see a run to 402-404 next week. 401.44 is the exact gap fill and the tan bear channel gives resistance of 403.5 for Monday and 402.5 for Tuesday. Also looking at the weekly now that the gaps been filled and arguably the weekly 200ema is support we should see that black bear channel broken and see the red bear channel tested near 403.5 during the week. \n\nBear case scenario- despite a pretty big 3.18% green day today there was a severe lack of momentum for 80% of the day. However, we had some very bullish volume. We can use that rising wedge as a possible rejection zone for Monday which gives us potential to see 392 before we reject. There is also a history that once a gap is filled the price action will hard reverse. The biggest bear case I am watching currently is that we died right at 390 EOD. IT filled the gap on the daily but that 390 is also a major resistance zone on the weekly. It is possible that the previous major support zone will now become a major resistance and we will see a gap down Monday to stay within that black channel (383 is the top) and then we will head back down to retest the weekly 200ema near 363. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4tgsx2ajum791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95753666dad49c8c32cd398701f47f21e5f0c0d0\n\nNow the VIX is something im trying to get a good grasp on. We have clearly been unwinding since last week but its been very choppy. We also saw a pretty aggressive EOD pop on the VIX that was out of the normal. There is a case that since UVXY spiked first (based off VIX futures) we actually might have some people going long on puts next week and we could see a bigger red week next week. Based off that black support line we shouldn’t see VIX break below 25.5 next week before we start our ascent back upwards. \n\nIf VIX sees 25 Monday and we gap fill 402 that could cause the VIX reversal and SPY reversal I was mentioning above. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nThis was actually a really great week for me. I made a REALLY bad trade on UVXY today though. I had entered at a perfect time and almost immediately saw 25% profits. However, I believe so much in the fact that the VIX was going to break 27 and SPY was going to see 380 that I held and didn’t lock profits. This was a big mistake. I did not see UVXY rocketing EOD like that before power hour and being so far OTM and 0dte I got wrecked hard and fast. Tough loss there. \n\nOverall this week my indicators worked really well for me and I was very patient in my entries. I was discussing this in my server EOD but I have been considering whether or not I want to remove VIX from my entry requirements. Currently I have a momentum indicator for SPY, VOLSPD, VOLD and VIX all on the 1 minute that I use to enter a trade. When they are all 4 bullish or bearish (aligned) I enter. However, I am seeing lately that VIX is not aligning much with SPY anymore and I am wondering if I am limiting myself. Today I kind of put that to the test EOD. I entered a 0dte during power hour based off volatility switch showing a trending state, spy breaking resistance on the 15min chart and the SPY, VOLSP and VOLD 1 min charts all being bullish. The play hit 100% for me and would have been 200% had I not sold. If I listened to VIX I would never have entered that trade. I wonder if in this market if volume is the true king and if I should listen to SPY and volumes only. I may do some experimenting next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cek84zwjum791.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cb32862857fa80a82371556b1bb5f532b8fc406\n\nOverall a great week.

No mate, please read the following for you to understand.\n\n\nA support level is a price level where there are more buyers than sellers. This means that the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level . \n\nA resistance level is the opposite of a support level . This means that there are more sellers than buyers. It is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises. Again, this means that the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level . \n\nA previous support level will sometimes become a resistance level when the price attempts to move back up, and conversely, a resistance level will become a support level as the price temporarily falls back. \n\n\nOnce an area or "zone" of support or resistance has been identified, those price levels can serve as potential entry or exit points because, as a price reaches a point of support or resistance, it will do one of two things—bounce back away from the support or resistance level (trading ranges), or violate the price level and continue in its direction (trading breakouts) —until it hits the next support or resistance level \n\nThe basic trading method for using support and resistance is to buy near support in uptrends or the parts of ranges or chart patterns where prices are moving up and to sell/sell short near resistance in downtrends or the parts of ranges and chart patterns where prices are moving down. Buying near support or selling near resistance can pay off, but there is no assurance that the support or resistance will hold. Therefore, consider waiting for some confirmation that the market is still respecting that area \n\nTrading breakouts, a breakout is a potential trading opportunity that occurs when an asset\'s price moves above a resistance level or moves below a support level on increasing volume . The first step in trading breakouts is to identify current price trend patterns along with support and resistance levels in order to plan possible entry and exit points. Once the asset trades beyond the price barrier, volatility tends to increase and prices usually trend in the breakout\'s direction. Breakouts are such an important trading strategy since these setups are the starting point for future volatility increases, large price swings and, in many circumstances, major price trends. When trading breakouts, it is important to consider the underlying asset\'s support and resistance levels. The more times an asset price has touched these areas, the more valid these levels are and the more important they become. At the same time, the longer these support and resistance levels have been in play, the better the outcome when the asset price finally breaks out. Asset prices will often move slightly further than we expect them to. This doesn\'t happen all the time, but when it does it is called a false breakout. Therefore it is important to consider waiting for some confirmation while trading breakouts. \n\nMarkets regularly cycle between clean trend, and choppy consolidation, spending as much as half the time in the consolidation overall. Usually after a large move in market , a consolidation phase occurs. After choppy consolidating phase where price moves between a strong resistance and a strong support a breakout occurs when either strong support fails or resistance broken. \n\nEveryone focuses on being smart. \nBut not being stupid is actually more important. Not being stupid is essential for survival. Do it buy puts as price heads down to strong support. Do not buy calls as price heads up to strong resistance.  If you do either expect heavy losses. \n\nBuy calls when strong resistance shatters. Buy puts when strong support fails. In other words for your YOLO options trade break outs.\n\n I probably will regret this but I will answer any question regarding support/resistance levels. \n\n\nNot responsible for how you use this information.

In this discussion I will be exploring the uranium sector as a whole, where things currently stand, what uranium is , what it\'s used for, why uranium has a good setup for the future and how you can get into uranium should you choose to. I\'ve been looking into this sector for over a year now and have done more hours of research than I could count. Before I get into anything I want to emphasize THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY. This is not about buying weekly calls, this is not a squeeze. This is an investment in a growing sector that should provide significant returns in the next few years. I\'m not bothering with short dated calls because right now the market is more or less whatever SPY does. SPY green, market green. SPY red, market red. If you want to do calls just play SPY for now since everything follows it. But if you want a good sector to put some cash that will pay off, then welcome to the discussion.\n\n**Uranium, what is it and why should I care?**\n\nMany of you have probably heard of uranium. It\'s that green glowing rock that kills you if you go near it and makes a Godzilla right? Nope. First, it\'s brown not green. Second, it\'s actually not very radioactive out of the ground. It needs a bunch of stuff done to it before it becomes that glowing stick thing you see on The Simpsons. But what\'s actually important about uranium is its use as a fuel source. Uranium is used to power nuclear powerplants. Plain and simple, that\'s its use. And before you go "Pfft nuclear is dead, waste of time." understand nuclear is actually more important than you think. As of today, the USA gets 20% of its baseload (24/7 consistent power generation.) power from nuclear. Yes 20%. That\'s not a small amount at all. And globally nuclear accounts for 10% of global baseload power. So the idea that nuclear is dead isn\'t correct. It\'s too important right now to be dead. Unless you think the world is going to just go into full brownout and blackouts, nuclear globally isn\'t being shut down in the next decade. It\'s just too complicated for the USA to replace 20% of its entire baseload energy generation no matter how much wind and solar is built (I actually like wind and solar mind you.).\n\nOn top of being a major energy source nuclear is carbon neutral. A nuclear powerplant with a 40 year operational life will generate as much carbon over its lifetime as a coal powerplant will produce in just 2 hours of operation. That\'s it. Not only is it carbon neutral, it\'s highly energy efficient. One uranium fuel pellet will generate as much energy as one ton of coal, 149 gallons of oil or 1700 cubic feet of natural gas. What this means, you can store a ton of energy in a small space using nuclear. For the USA that might not matter, but for nations like Japan that don\'t have as much space, being able to store years of energy in just a few warehouses is significant.\n\nPast the efficiency, nuclear is a baseload energy source unlike wind and solar. This means it generates consistent amounts of reliable electricity 24/7. Wind and solar can\'t do this. Sometimes it\'s not as windy. Sometimes it\'s not as sunny. This matters because if you\'re building an electrical grid, you need a certain amount of it to be providing a consistent predictable amount of energy. Otherwise, you risk blackouts at certain periods. Electrical grids NEED baseload energy in order to ensure the lights stay on. Right now the carbon free options are nuclear or hydroelectric. But while you can build a nuclear powerplant anywhere, hydroelectric is limited to areas with flowing water. Sure it works in the USA, but good luck providing electricity in the African desert with hydroelectric. I\'m not saying wind, solar or hydroelectric are bad. I\'m saying they can\'t be your only energy generation either due to geographic limitations or having too much fluctuation in energy production. They\'re great as PART of an energy grid, just not as 100% of it.\n\n**Downsides of nuclear.**\n\nWhile nuclear has many upsides there are of course downsides. Let\'s start with the giant radioactive elephant in the room. NUCLEAR MELTDOWNS!!! OMG so scary right? They happen and then millions of people die and stuff. Except that\'s not exactly true. People are familiar with 3 major meltdowns, Chernobyl, Fukushima and 3 mile island. Let\'s do the easy one first. 3 mile island had a grand total of 0 deaths. I\'ll say that again. 0 people died from 3 mile island. Nobody. That doesn\'t mean it didn\'t have some negative things, but there were no deaths. Not just that but they got the leak under control quickly. Now onto Chernobyl. Yes people died, and the nearby land was ruined. However, this was a very special case. See, the USSR really didn\'t give a damn about the people of Ukraine when they build Chernobyl. Like at all. They wanted energy generation and skipped pretty much ALL safety regulations. Yes it was bad, but nobody will ever be allowed to build a powerplant that unsafe and unregulated ever again because of it. This was less nuclear bad and more neglecting any form of safety measures for any powerplant bad. Finally we have Fukushima. Yes a big scary disaster. But like 3 mile island nobody died from the meltdown. Now people died from the tsunami. But there were no recorded deaths from radiation exposure. Add in it took a historically large earthquake AND the powerplant regulators ignoring a key safety measure, moving the generators off the bottom floor, which they had been told to do for years. I don\'t want to downplay these events but they\'re not the world ending disasters the news likes to pretend they were. In fact, nuclear has the lowest death per KWh of any energy source wind and solar included. Add in new nuclear powerplants being much safer and having many fail safes. (Fun fact, Fukushima was actually OLDER than Chernobyl). Take the Zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant in Ukraine. Russia recently bombed this powerplant during an assault. Everyone was freaking out. Know what happened? Nothing. Why? Because nuclear powerplant reactors are build with a protective core designed to take a DIRECT impact from a full 747. They\'re a lot safer than people realize.\n\nNext downside, the cost. Nuclear powerplants are EXPENSIVE to build and a lot of companies don\'t want to build them. It takes 10 years of operating for a powerplant to just break even. That\'s a scary investment and a lot of companies won\'t do it. But there are new powerplants being built. The US recently has 2 new powerplants finish in Georgia and is working on extending the lifetime of current powerplants including Diablo Canyon, the last powerplant in California which the governor has requested a 20 year life extension for and it looks like he\'s going to get it. That\'s right, even super green California is now changing their tune about nuclear. But it\'s not just the USA. Germany has started talking about delaying the shutdown of their remaining powerplants (They probably won\'t, but the fact Germany is even willing to discuss the idea shows a huge sentiment shift.) Japan\'s new ruling party has made restarting their nuclear fleet (shut down since Fukushima) a top priority with plans for several reactors to come back online this year. India, South Korea, Romania, France all have plans for new reactors. Even Bill Gates is working in Wyoming on creating new safer small modular reactors (SMRs). Then there\'s China. China has committed to building 150 new reactors over the next decade. Yes 150 reactors or 15 reactors a year. Simply put, nuclear isn\'t going away and even seems to be growing now. Even Gretta Thunberg has come out in favor of nuclear.\n\n**Ok so nuclear will exist, who cares.**\n\nSo we\'ve established two things, nuclear currently exists at a level too large to shut down anytime soon AND places aren\'t just not shutting it down, they\'re adding even more. Now we get to the money part. See that uranium used to power a nuclear powerplant, it has a problem. It\'s too cheap. How cheap? Today uranium sells for $49/pound. But it costs a mining company $65-$70/ pound to mine it. Yes, companies currently lose $16-$20/pound mining uranium. But why would they mine it if they\'re losing money is probably your question. Well, for most companies, they\'re not. They have shut down all mining and are waiting for prices to go higher. This has created a major deficit in supply. Currently, 180 million pounds of uranium are used per year globally while only 120 million pounds are mined. That\'s a 33% yearly supply deficit that has been going on for 3 years now. Now you might ask how is that possible. Well in 2011, when Fukushima happened, Japan shut down all their nuclear reactors. But, they had a bunch of nuclear fuel already in warehouses. Powerplants will have between 2-3 years of supply on hand at any given time. So what did these Japanese powerplants do? They sold all that uranium and flooded the market. Look below at the graph of the price of uranium starting in 2011.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjy82kf6m1891.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c78a3ef97d1f49e6a575907faea73923e5b0646\n\nSee that giant price drop from $50 down to a low of under $20? That\'s all that Japanese supply flooding the market. Well that supply is running out. Not only is it starting to run out, Japan is restarting their reactors as stated above, meaning they\'re going from a net seller to a buyer of uranium. All that cheap supply utilities could buy up is disappearing, and when supply goes away prices go up. Let\'s see another graph. from 2007. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/89ny4xtlm1891.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1514f8cfc1aa37153ec2cd574cf08ea6c43185e\n\nSee that giant price spike? That\'s from supply going away. Specifically, from the USA ending their program of decommissioning nuclear weapons which gave a cheap supply of uranium for powerplants to buy. That same thing is about to happen in the uranium sector. All the cheap Japanese uranium has been bought and they\'re done selling. This is going to cause another price spike and the mining companies are going to thrive. See, as stated earlier, most of these companies are not mining. What this means is they\'re sitting waiting for the price to get to a level worth mining and then they\'ll start selling. Now, in the uranium sector selling is done through a contract with utilities. Usually these contracts are signed for 10 years with a price range. A bottom price so the mines don\'t get screwed and a top price so utilities don\'t get screwed. As of today, most companies don\'t have any contracts, but as the supply runs out utilities are going to be forced to talk to the miners and sign these long term contracts. And this isn\'t just theoretical. Cameco (CCJ) the 2nd largest uranium mining company in the world announced in January they had signed 40 million USD in new contracting that month which was more than they did for the entire year of 2021. Other mines are also announcing the beginning of some early contracts as utilities are finally showing signs of realizing their nice cheap supply of Japanese uranium is going to run out. And when these contracts come it won\'t be one or two at a time. It\'s going to be a rush of utilities scrambling to get  contract signed with whoever they can. Because the uranium sector has one other key thing. It\'s small. Tiny. How small? The entire uranium sector has a market cap less than that of Tesla. That\'s it. Not only is the sector tiny, you can count on two hands ALL the companies currently able to mine uranium. And as for the ones trying to build a mine? The fastest ones expect to be running in 2024 AT BEST. Here\'s another chart for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mplfck24o1891.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3cb58c6e2b1ceed55eb1cfcd7175d2534633685\n\nThis chart shows the total projected uranium mining compared to the demand out to 2040. See that red space above? That\'s a deficit where demand beats out supply. Here\'s the thing about this chart. It assumes a full restart of ALL existing mines AND ALL planned uranium mines. Yes. Even if every single mine and planned mine came online on time with full production there would still be a huge deficit. And uranium mines do not have near a 100% start rate. More like a 10% chance for a company to go from discovering uranium to actually getting a functioning mine. And understand something about uranium, it is an inelastic fuel. You can\'t substitute anything for uranium. Either you have it OR you can\'t run your power plant. And not running isn\'t an option. Utilities can and will pay huge amounts to get their fuel supply. This is because uranium is a fraction of the cost of a powerplant. It accounts for just 5% of their operational costs. That\'s it, so a powerplant can have the price of uranium shoot up and see minimal impact. The analogy I like to use, think of a steak dinner. The steak is what\'s expensive. Now do you put salt on the steak? Sure. But do you care what the salt costs? If tomorrow salt did a 10X on price would you stop eating steak? No, because salt is dirt cheap so who cares what it costs. The same holds for uranium. And even if the price goes through the roof, governments will subsidize before they allow blackouts. Because that\'s what the entire uranium sector really boils down to. Uranium sells for too little to the point where one of two things must happen. Either the price of uranium will go up to at least $65-$70/pound OR when you flick a light switch in the USA in 5 years, the lights will not work. That\'s the bet you\'re making, which one do you think is more likely to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sprott and uranium.**\n\nI\'m going to take a quick second to talk about one other factor in the uranium sector. Sprott. For those of you unfamiliar, Sprott is a resource investment fund run by a man named Eric Sprott. He runs large physical funds that let investors buy shares which he then uses to buy physical gold or silver. Very simple system. You buy some shares, he buys some gold. You can sell your shares or ask for payment of gold in an amount equal to your shares. Well, he\'s doing this exact same thing for uranium (minus the delivery part, sorry guys you can\'t get uranium sent to your home.) The system is the same, you buy shares his company uses that money to buy physical uranium which they store in a warehouse. But here\'s the thing, this is not a resell system. Sprott gets paid per transaction, they buy an amount and keep 1% of the purchasing fee for themselves. That\'s how they make money. They DO NOT resell this uranium, in fact, there currently is no system to resell the uranium in place. What this means, there is a system in place currently taking in millions of pounds of uranium off the market that will not resell. This takes a deficit and adds even MORE pressure since now Sprott is buying up supply from utilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So what do I do?**\n\nAh the big question, what do you do with this information. Well, you find uranium miners you like and buy shares or LEAPs (at least 1 year out though ideally 2). Why? Because this is a very simple play, the price of uranium will go up. That\'s not the question. The question is WHEN will the price go up. So you play the miners and wait because at some point we will see utilities rushing to secure supply and when that happens these miners are going to rocket with it. Now a couple of things to understand. Because this sector is so small it can rocket but those rockets go both ways. When money is flowing in stocks can jump quick. But, when money flows out when, oh I don\'t know, the entire stock market is selling off, money flows out quickly too. And that\'s exactly what happened to uranium over the last 7 weeks. It\'s been selling off hard. Add in the summer being a historically bad time for uranium and more selling won\'t be a shock at all. So you\'re probably saying why should you buy something that\'s selling off and could sell off more? Well here\'s why, because that\'s when it\'s cheap. Money is made in bear markets and realized in bull markets. You buy companies with a good long term outlook when they\'re down because that gives you the best chance to make money.  And right now uranium miners are down at a very cheap level. Now this doesn\'t mean throw every penny you have into it. Add over time, maybe do some cash secured puts, down cost average on dips. You\'ve got all summer since uranium usually does poor until September or so. But now is a great time to position yourself in a sector looking good in the long run. Especially in a market where everything is being beat up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Quick notes.**\n\nJust a quick addressing of some things I tend to hear asked. Throium reactors are a thing being worked on, but they aren\'t ready yet and won\'t be for years. Even when done they can\'t do a 100% uranium replacement overnight it\'ll take years. I like them but it\'s future tech. Fission is also being worked on but that\'s even further out future tech. It\'s been "20 years away" for 50 years now. Yes, storage of spent nuclear material is an issue but they have some storage methods, even if not ideal and more importantly when given the choice of where do I store this fuel after 500 years or blackouts, governments will choose to deal with the storage later and avoid the blackouts. Yes wind and solar exist. I like them. I think they\'re great. But as of today, they are energy that needs to exist with nuclear not replace it. The tech again just isn\'t there yet. Yes new companies can build a uranium mine and uranium isn\'t that rare. However, building a mine is a long and difficult process, especially to get permits. Most nations are very strict about allowing a company to mine uranium because of what it is. As such, you need to show not just you know how to mine it, you can do it safely and without impacting the environment. That can take near 10 years and often takes that long if not longer. So year, when prices spike new companies will pop up, but they\'ll be a decade or more out from actually mining anything and this assumes they can even find staff who know how to run a uranium mine, which is not easy to find and get permits.\n\nSo that\'s the gist of the uranium sector and why I feel it\'s a good place to park some money for the next few years. It\'s got a good future to it, it\'s not going anywhere and in fact, shows strong signs of growing and it\'s needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Uranium is a needed irreplaceable fuel source that currently sells for too little. Either the price is going to go up over the next few years or the lights will go out. If you think the lights will work when you walk into a room you think uranium will go up. That simple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** Note, for any company listed as "under market cap" just message me and I\'ll tell you what it is. Sadly, like I said small sector so most companies I own I can\'t list within WSB rules. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCCJ: 283 shares.\n\nBelow Market Cap Stock 1: 1,200 shares\n\nBelow Market Cap Stock 2: 1,800 shares, 10 2024 $1C\'s, 17 2024 $1.50C\'s\n\nBelow Market Cap Stock 3: 2,000 shares'), ('2 Week Forecast for Major Indices 26 June 2022', '2 Week Forecast for Major Indices 26 June 2022 \n\n2 week forecast by our AI analyst with key levels for\n\n\\-SPY\n\n\\-QQQ\n\n\\-IWM\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hh82kzwjlz791.png?width=877&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f67708fcdacbb1b143cf7d9907643d9667128f96'), ('🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA - Monday June 27, 2022 - 0DTE Scalpers Delight', '🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA - Monday June 27, 2022 - 0DTE Scalpers Delight# Economic Calendar - June 27, 2022\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7pojn70zy791.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dcb0364ba4c6f909df3a192ed86b3541f0b422e\n\n# SPY - Technical Analysis\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/43w6re82zy791.png?width=1374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a309eeb05e5ec7c5d3a3da950a2984706f9749d0\n\n* Break 389.87 - 392.01 and look for 393.73\n* Break 393.73 and look for 395.91 - 398.04\n* Break 398.04 and look for 401.45\n* Break 401.45 and look for 404.17 - 405.58\n* Lose 386.79 - 385.65 and look for 383.92 - 381.36\n* Lose 381.36 and look for 378.93 - 377.96\n* Lose 377.96 and look for 375.83\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k308wox3zy791.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=574f6a7aeb6d524f078ee31e19f63f0f097899c8\n\n* Gap-fill: 395.44 - 401.52\n* Resistance: 409.73 - 415.81 - 422.64\n* Suport: 386.52 - 381.27 - 378.74\n* Downside targets: 371.82 - 368.21 - 363.41 - 362.16 - 358.37 - 353.94\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iw60c036zy791.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9b011ef518e68ad5e2118b0004361c4693aaac9\n\n## Notes\n\n* TL/DR:\n   * 5 min.

And I did it while you morons are out here drawing straight lines on pictures of crooked lines. The last DD you’ll ever need.I won’t waste time presenting you regards with too many facts that you’re small minds can’t handle, so here’s the brief background. While y’all were busy figuring out how to zoom in and out of graphs online I was busy mastering the blade and honing my knowledge of astrophysics. Then in the middle of perfecting the final kata of the Hiten Mitsurugi-ryū style to slay my master my minds eye opened and I saw it all. (That’s the end of the background).\n\nSo we all know inflation is hitting hard by now, but so few truly see the big picture. The why. What if I told you to go back to 2008? You’d immediately think Obama and the recession, but you’d only be half right. You’re thinking of the wrong Obama. It all starts and ends with Michelle. \n\n“That’s truly retarded” you say, but I’m way past retarded. I’m wearing a bright yellow helmet to bed at this point. You see it starts with her and her one goal. She never hid it. In fact she always left it right there in the open because she counted on y’all being too stupid to see it. War on the fattys.\n\nShe saw in 2006 the recession was coming and knew it was her time to strike. She’d been planning it for decades. She’d positioned herself perfectly and was ready to strike with her good friend Jerome Powell. You morons never wondered why a democrat would nominate a republican to the federal reserve? You blind silly stupid fools. \n\n“How could they possibly be connected?” you ask. Well now we’re getting somewhere. It’s obvious, they both graduated from Princeton. That’s it. There doesn’t need to be more. Occam’s razor.\n\nSo back to 2008 and the war on the fattys. The housing market had collapsed and we were at the bottom with the first black president. No one would have any more room in there primitive minds to think about fighting for the true tendies. The fried and edible kind. She started slow, removing soda from schools and slowing progressed to the most draconian measures possible to destroy your precious BMIs. She believed by attacking our children we’d all be living in her hellscape of pelatons and unsalted asparagus by the end of the presidency. \n\nBut then something she didn’t count on. The rising stock market gave people more money to buy more tendies. And without homes they had nowhere to cook so they fled in droves to holy places of McDonald’s and Chick Fil A, the last bastions of true American freedom.\n\nShe was distraught with such a stupid miscalculation. How could she not have seen this? Then she realized an evil truth. She had unwittingly defeated herself by coming out of the recession. The key to destroying the fried life blood of American goodness was the recession itself.\n\nThat’s when she had to go back to her secret confidant Powell and they decided no more half measures. They needed someone in the place of power. She used her husband’s marionette presidency to get Jerome to the Fed. Then it truly began.\n\nThey sent the stock market to the moon and created this internet fad of calling money “tendies” because of what it could buy. They were removing the gold standard right in front of your regarded little eyes as you slowly forgot why you even wanted money in the first place. Of course it would be too obvious if they wholly replaced the true tendies with the fake green vegetable colored ones, so the created the Trump diversion. She had learned from the 08 recession and subsequent rise that sometimes you had to do the exact opposite of what logic would dictate to get the results you want.\n\nThey would give us what we need to the most extreme extent. Money flowing like water and tendies of every form rose out of nowhere. A holy land where there was a Canes’s, Layne’s, Golden Chick, Popeye’s, KFC, Wendy’s, and every other form of fried chicken on every street corner in America. We were fatter and happier than ever before, but we went too far.\n\nShe used a rare walrus virus to kill all the old people and intelligent citizens who knew not to get vaccinated or where masks. With the smart ones out of the way she and Powell were free to print trillions and inflate the market as high as they wanted.She then used Elon’s space lasers to hack the voting booths and get Biden in and that was that.\n\nNow the plan cannot be stopped. We’re all too fat and there is no one smart or strong enough left to roll us to streets to fight back. It started with gas. When no one can afford to drive we’ll be forced to walk and ride bikes and all other forms of torturous exercise. Of course it doesn’t matter for most of us because the trump years have all but guaranteed enough artery cloggage to ensure widow maker heart attacks. But our children will grow up thinking this tyranny is how it’s always been.\n\nThen it was the corn and wheat. With cost rising and food replenishing they have started making smaller portions. You’ve all seen the “double stuffed” Oreo and “thick cut” bacon posts. She’s in control of the manufacturers so of course the packaging won’t change as she feeds you less and less. \n\nSlowly she took our true tendies as we were distracted worrying about the fake tendies. Soon our kids will only know Kale chips and Sevia poisoned Flint water. We are a victim to our own arrogance.\n\nI could on, but it’s pointless. Michelle has won. Thanks Obama.\n\nTLDR: Michell Obama is behind the recession to continue her unholy war on the fattys. \n\nPositions: \nSPY 350P 9/16\nPTO 300C 9/16'), ('Every time SPY gets the D we rally, big bullish', 'Every time SPY gets the D we rally, big bullish'), ('Just to fuck up mood to all the bulls zooming out SPY, This is NIKKEI so bag hold till your children grow old😂 Just kidding but imagine buying in 1989 and still being 20% down 33 yrs later🤪', 'Just to fuck up mood to all the bulls zooming out SPY, This is NIKKEI so bag hold till your children grow old😂 Just kidding but imagine buying in 1989 and still being 20% down 33 yrs later🤪'), ('The VIX spike that leaked out on Friday has foretold of a major volatility increase being imminent in each of the previous occurrences (4/4).', 'The VIX spike that leaked out on Friday has foretold of a major volatility increase being imminent in each of the previous occurrences (4/4).&amp;#x200B;\n\n[VIX  climbed from 28.3 to 29.72 in 1 minute.

The Federal Reserve recognized this importance as well and set in motion a plan to prevent it from continuing to repeat itself.   By June of 2020 it was apparent that the monthly volatility cycles were upending investors and was going to spiral into a larger full blown crash.   As part of the Fed\'s recovery outline, a market recovery team was to be created, affectionately known to us as the plunge protection team.   Their algos began to routinely show themselves during trading to prop up the major indexes and provided price support to entire sectors worth of companies stock so our then feeble markets didn\'t appear outwardly sick in what became known to many as fed pump mornings (fed pumps, money printer go brr etc.).    This set in motion a dangerous policy of the Reserve algorithmically suppressing VIX to clamp it down and in the process engineer false market confidence to prevent skittish investors from fleeing the markets at the first sign of trouble.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All of these efforts were unprecedented, it gave them a level of access and control to our financial markets that had never been seen and the unbridled ability to dictate much of the narrative driving the perception of our recovering economy. From that point on an all out market protection war to save us from ourselves was put underway.  And it worked, a little too well.  It led to one of the strongest continuous bull markets in modern history and set the stage for that V-Shaped recovery that we were so promised.. but at what cost?   The cost of lying to the markets, falsely propping it up with strings and cheating volatility as a means to suppress the truth of how bad the situation really was to everyone.  And in the process enticing confident investors to pile into positions with margin debt at levels never before seen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***"The suppression of volatility creates a debt to the market that must be paid."***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was in these efforts of market control and suppression that myself, and others, began to notice cracks leaking out that could not be explained.

In addition there was always an [immediate and successful attempt to crash the spike back](https://i.imgur.com/kmF5cne.jpg) down to regain market stability for the day to calm peoples nerves before giving the market the full VIX dose over the trading days immediately afterwards.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Why it matters?**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the past when we have observed this behavior under healthy green markets, it has signaled the point at which the markets are about to incur the volatility debt that the Fed has been sparing us from through their market control measures.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Where it goes from here or how long this market uncertainty lasts is unclear.   What is clear is that VIX has a long overdue climb to fulfill and a debt with the markets to reckon with.  It will be slowed down and even dialed back for periodic intervals to maintain stability and produce green markets, but its\' climb will likely persist as the pressure it creates is released in a controlled manner.  Which I do not believe has fully happened, in spite of the pain this past week has wrought.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Position: UVXY calls will be rewarded but should be treated with respect(--take profits),  and entered at appropriate times.

In this discussion I will be exploring the uranium sector as a whole, where things currently stand, what uranium is and what it\'s used for, why uranium has a good setup for the future and how you can get into uranium should you choose to. I\'ve been looking into this sector for over a year now and have done more hours of research than I could count. Before I get into anything I want to emphasize THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY. This is not about buying weekly calls, this is not a squeeze. This is an investment in a growing sector that should provide significant returns in the next few years. I\'m not bothering with short dated calls because right now the market is more or less whatever SPY does.  SPY green, market green. SPY red market red. If you want to do calls just play SPY for now. But if you want a good sector to put some cash that will pay off, then welcome to the discussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Uranium, what is it and why should I care?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of you have probably heard of uranium. It\'s that green glowing rock that kills you if you go near it and make a Godzilla right? Nope. First, it\'s brown not green. Second, it\'s actually not very radioactive out the ground. It needs a bunch of stuff done to it before it becomes that glowing stick thing you see on The Simpsons. But what\'s actually important about uranium is its use as a fuel source. Uranium is used to power nuclear powerplants. Plain and simple, that\'s its use. And before you go "Pfft nuclear is dead, waste of time." understand nuclear is actually more important than you think. As of today, the USA gets 20% of its baseload (24/7 consistent power generation.) power from nuclear. Yes 20%. That\'s not a small amount at all. And globally nuclear accounts for 10% of global baseload power. So the idea that nuclear is dead isn\'t correct. It\'s too important right now to be dead. Unless you think the world is going to just go into full brownout and blackouts, nuclear globally isn\'t being shut down in the next decade. It\'s just too complicated for the USA to replace 20% of its entire baseload energy generation no matter how much wind and solar is build (I actually like wind and solar mind you.).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn top of being a major energy source nuclear is carbon neutral. A nuclear powerplant with a 40 year operational life will generate as much carbon over its lifetime as a coal powerplant will produce in just 2 hours of operation. That\'s it. Not only is it carbon neutral, it\'s highly energy efficient. One uranium fuel pellet will generate as much energy as one ton of coal, 149 gallons of oil or 1700 cubic feet of natural gas. What this means, you can store a ton of energy in a small space using nuclear. For the USA that might not matter, but for nations like Japan that don\'t have as much space, being able to store years of energy in just a few warehouses is significant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPast the efficiency, nuclear is a baseload energy source unlike wind and solar. This means it generates consistent amounts of reliable electricity 24/7. Wind and solar can\'t do this. Sometimes it\'s not as windy. Sometimes it\'s not as sunny. This matters because if you\'re building an electrical grid, you need a certain amount of it to be providing a consistent predictable amount of energy. Otherwise, you risk blackouts at certain periods. Electrical grids NEED baseload energy in order to ensure the lights stay on. Right now the carbon free options are nuclear or hydroelectric. But while you can build a nuclear powerplant anywhere, hydroelectric is limited to areas with flowing water. Sure it works in the USA, but good luck providing electricity in the African desert with hydroelectric. I\'m not saying wind, solar or hydroelectric are bad. I\'m saying they can\'t be your only energy generation either due to geographic limitations or having too much fluctuation in energy production. They\'re great as PART of an energy grid, just not as 100% of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Downsides of nuclear.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile nuclear has many upsides there are of course downsides. Let\'s start with the giant radioactive elephant in the room. NUCLEAR MELTDOWNS!!! OMG so scary right? They happen and then millions of people die and stuff. Except that\'s not exactly true. People are familiar with 3 major meltdowns, Chernobyl, Fukushima and 3 mile island. Let\'s do the easy one first. 3 mile island had a grand total of 0 deaths.  I\'ll say that again.  0 people died from 3 mile island. Nobody.  That doesn\'t mean it didn\'t have some negative things, but there were no deaths.  Not just that but they got the leak under control quickly.  Now onto Chernobyl. Yes people died, and the nearby land was ruined. However, this was a very special case. See, the USSR really didn\'t give a damn about the people of Ukraine when they build Chernobyl. Like at all. They wanted energy generation and skipped pretty much ALL safety regulations.  Yes it was bad, but nobody will ever be allowed to build a powerplant that unsafe and unregulated ever again because of it.  This was less nuclear bad and more neglecting any form of safety measures for any powerplant bad.  Finally we have Fukushima.  Yes a big scary disaster. But like 3 mile island nobody died from the meltdown. Now people died from the tsunami. But there were no recorded deaths from radiation exposure.  Add in it took a historically large earthquake AND the powerplant regulators ignoring a key safety measure, moving the generators off the bottom floor, which they had been told to do for years.  I don\'t want to downplay these events but they\'re not the world ending disasters the news likes to pretend they were. In fact, nuclear has the lowest death per KWh of any energy source wind and solar included.  Add in new nuclear powerplants being much safer and having many fail safes. (Fun fact, Fukushima was actually OLDER than Chernobyl).  Take the Zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant in Ukraine.  Russia recently bombed this powerplant during an assault. Everyone was freaking out.  Know what happened?  Nothing.  Why? Because nuclear powerplant reactors are build with a protective core designed to take a DIRECT impact from a full 747. They\'re a lot safer than people realize. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext downside, the cost. Nuclear powerplants are EXPENSIVE to build and a lot of companies don\'t want to build them. It takes 10 years of operating for a powerplant to just break even. That\'s a scary investment and a lot of companies won\'t do it. But there are new powerplants being built. The US recently has 2 new powerplants finish in Georgia and is working on extending the lifetime of current powerplants including Diablo Canyon, the last powerplant in California which the governor has requested a 20 year life extension for and it looks like he\'s going to get it. That\'s right, even super green California is now changing their tune about nuclear. But it\'s not just the USA. Germany has started talking about delaying the shutdown of their remaining powerplants (They probably won\'t, but the fact Germany is even willing to discuss the idea shows a huge sentiment shift.) Japan\'s new ruling party has made restarting their nuclear fleet (shut down since Fukushima) a top priority with plans for several reactors to come back online this year. India, South Korea, Romania, France all have plans for new reactors. Even Bill Gates is working in Wyoming on creating new safer small modular reactors (SMRs). Then there\'s China. China has committed to building 150 new reactors over the next decade. Yes 150 reactors or 15 reactors a year. Simply put, nuclear isn\'t going away and even seems to be growing now. Even Gretta Thunberg has come out in favor of nuclear. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ok so nuclear will exist, who cares.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we\'ve established two things, nuclear currently exists at a level too large to shut down anytime soon AND places aren\'t just not shutting it down, they\'re adding even more. Now we get to the money part. See that uranium used to power a nuclear powerplant, it has a problem. It\'s too cheap. How cheap? Today uranium sells for $49/pound. But it costs a mining company $65-$70/ pound to mine it. Yes, companies currently lose $16-$20/pound mining uranium. But why would they mine it if they\'re losing money is probably your question. Well, for most companies, they\'re not. They have shut down all mining and are waiting for prices to go higher. This has created a major deficit in supply. Currently, 180 million pounds of uranium are used per year globally while only 120 million pounds are mined. That\'s a 33% yearly supply deficit that has been going on for 3 years now. Now you might ask how is that possible. Well in 2011, when Fukushima happened, Japan shut down all their nuclear reactors. But, they had a bunch of nuclear fuel already in warehouses. Powerplants will have between 2-3 years of supply on hand at any given time. So what did these Japanese powerplants do? They sold all that uranium and flooded the market.

You are working at Wendy’s, you are not a trader you are a gambler. Okay so his levels useless to me? No mate, please read the following for you to understand.\n\n\nA support level is a price level where there are more buyers than sellers. This means that the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level . \n\nA resistance level is the opposite of a support level . This means that there are more sellers than buyers. It is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises. Again, this means that the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level . \n\nA previous support level will sometimes become a resistance level when the price attempts to move back up, and conversely, a resistance level will become a support level as the price temporarily falls back. \n\n\nOnce an area or "zone" of support or resistance has been identified, those price levels can serve as potential entry or exit points because, as a price reaches a point of support or resistance, it will do one of two things—bounce back away from the support or resistance level (trading ranges), or violate the price level and continue in its direction (trading breakouts) —until it hits the next support or resistance level \n\nThe basic trading method for using support and resistance is to buy near support in uptrends or the parts of ranges or chart patterns where prices are moving up and to sell/sell short near resistance in downtrends or the parts of ranges and chart patterns where prices are moving down. Buying near support or selling near resistance can pay off, but there is no assurance that the support or resistance will hold. Therefore, consider waiting for some confirmation that the market is still respecting that area \n\nTrading breakouts, a breakout is a potential trading opportunity that occurs when an asset\'s price moves above a resistance level or moves below a support level on increasing volume . The first step in trading breakouts is to identify current price trend patterns along with support and resistance levels in order to plan possible entry and exit points. Once the asset trades beyond the price barrier, volatility tends to increase and prices usually trend in the breakout\'s direction. Breakouts are such an important trading strategy since these setups are the starting point for future volatility increases, large price swings and, in many circumstances, major price trends. When trading breakouts, it is important to consider the underlying asset\'s support and resistance levels. The more times an asset price has touched these areas, the more valid these levels are and the more important they become. At the same time, the longer these support and resistance levels have been in play, the better the outcome when the asset price finally breaks out. Asset prices will often move slightly further than we expect them to. This doesn\'t happen all the time, but when it does it is called a false breakout. Therefore it is important to consider waiting for some confirmation while trading breakouts. \n\nMarkets regularly cycle between clean trend, and choppy consolidation, spending as much as half the time in the consolidation overall. Usually after a large move in market , a consolidation phase occurs. After choppy consolidating phase where price moves between a strong resistance and a strong support a breakout occurs when either strong support fails or resistance broken. \n\nEveryone focuses on being smart. \nBut not being stupid is actually more important. Not being stupid is essential for survival. Do not buy puts as price heads down to strong support. Do not buy calls as price heads up to strong resistance.  Do not buy options when market consolidating.\n\nBuy calls when strong resistance shatters. Buy puts when strong support fails. Buy options during breakouts when market is trending.\n\n I probably will regret this but I will answer any question regarding support/resistance levels. \n\n\nNot responsible for how you use this information.

Bulls and bears could both have a fairly large argument that they were right. But the more I study this chart and thing about today and the VIX I feel the bulls are the winners today and this week (or at least tomorrow).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h00q2xp0v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67734994c25a0cc825918783c6895255dd901ba6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eeenyia1v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac08aa42f99e12d23dd58668cdf3cf7ea9382d82\n\nLooking at the daily we got a lot going on. \n\nBlue arrows- one could say today is a hanging man candle, however, a TRUE hanging man (reversal) is supposed to be 2x longer wick then body (thanks to Trav11s for pointing this out). If you look at the first arrow from May 17th you see the true hanging man causes a massive drop the next day… however, if you look at the one from June 23rd (granted this candle was fighting between a hanging man and dragonfly (bullish) doji candle) we actually saw a massive gap up the next day. \n\nGaps- we currently have TWO gaps below us now… 381.37 to 378.83 and 370.18 to 369.38 and we have one gap left above 401.44 to 395.78. The gap above is the biggest and longest over due. \n\nDotted blue bull channel- we now have a potential blue dotted bull channel forming that uses June 17th and June 23rd to form support and a “projected” resistance using the June 13th candle. This channel actually gives us a ton of upside and gives us plenty of room to see that 402 gap fill. \n\nBlack dotted bear channel- we have a projected bear channel using June 13th, June 15th, June 24th and June 27th (today) as resistance. We then projected support off June 17th. This channel would prevent a upward gap fill and would favor both lower gaps filling by EOD. \n\nRising wedge (bearish)- using the black dotted RESISTANCE line and the blue dotted SUPPORT line we actually are seeing a rising wedge. This can be considered an exhaustion trend and could signal a top is in. However, the one issue with rising wedges (and falling wedges for that matter) is with enough volume you can break through this and turn then into a channel instead of a wedge. Or the wedge can be extended. \n\nToday we broke below the daily 20ema of 388.6 numerous times and I believe that’s why that support held so well plus it was a bigger support from earlier in May. We closed essentially on the 20ema daily EMA today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fn2ontx1v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c44622dc75da0a7305a5a65c98b9f875791f32\n\nNow the VIX is still continuing to fall and we have yet to reach key support range of 25. But we are getting close. The one thing im seeing and its highlighted by these big blue arrows is that we are getting some fairly large spikes on the VIX that are all falling right around this resistance line and once those spikes hit we seem to be unwinding the vix the rest of the day. Today again EOD we saw volume and SPY in a bearish momentum trend while we actually saw VIX dropping. They were all pretty disconnected again last week. \n\nLooking at the big red lines on the vix we actually are seeing a similar falling wedge that appears to perfectly inverse the rising wedge on SPY. Now again if VIX falls hard enough it will go right through this support line and this support line is not nearly as strong as the resistance line. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rywq74i2v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=038b20c59452de2f017207545993b6235d6bc46e\n\nBy tomorrow and maybe even by open tomorrow we will see whether the VIX is going to break the falling wedge or not. \n\nWhere am I at? Whats my bias? \n\nWell I actually was fairly bearish last week and we didn’t drop and by EOW I was then bullish. I this morning was feeling bearish for the week but with the 388.6 support holding so strong and today being hella low volume and VIX still unwinding I am actually feeling bullish. I think that SPY Wednesday we will see SPY fill the 401.55 gap on the daily (it could do it tomorrow with a 3.3% green day though…). \n\nBut I al looking for a 401.55 gap fill and potentially see bigger bear channel (the one dating back to January) resistance test. If we were to gap fill on Wednesday we actually would see a perfect gap fill and channel resistance rejection at 402. That is my anticipation for this week. I think once the gap fills though we will most likely be bearish though but best case bulls could break this out to 410 range. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kf2d9o33v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50832e89bc83b90f3809bc4b860f34037749359f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4cumltp3v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=490940f0e8822ae5affb5b74640e86a7e6f85faa\n\nThis is something I used to do a long time ago but I honestly stopped finding predictive value in it cause it was so close to SPY… someone suggested with the inconsistency of SPY right now that it could be a good time to revisit on ES (SPY Futures) TA… well lets take a look at the daily on ES and see what we got. \n\nOverall the rising wedge I had mentioned on SPY actually is invalidated by the ES chart. So if you look at the Black dotted line using June 15th and June 24th and resistance points today we actually wicked through that line which means its invalidated. So we shouldn’t see that SPY rising wedge play out (however, we could re draw the black line using todays top and see it play out later this week). \n\nThere is a light blue bull channel using the support line from June 21, 22, 23 and 24th that seems pretty strong. We did not touch that line today but there is a case to be made that if todays (June 28th) candle was to drop we might see it touch that point which shows support at 3870. \n\nNow the daily candle for yesterday on ES actually is a gravestone doji which usually when seen at the top of a bullish run can signal a reversal. \n\nBull case for ES- we will look to ride the daily 20ema support at 3896.5 overnight and look to test the new rising wedge resistance line at 3965. Bulls want to see a clean break through 3965 and eventually will look to retake that 4020 level. This 4020 level is an approximation of the 401.55 gap fill that I spoke of earlier. \n\nBear case for ES- tonight bears will look to break under the daily 20ema of 3896 and tomorrow break through the daily 8ema of 3854. Once 3854 is broken the blue dotted support line from this rally will be broken. Once that is broken bears will look to break down 3761 support next. \n\nOverall looking at the ES chart I don’t feel that my bias for tomorrow has really changed at all. I am slightly concerned by the gravestone doji candle from yesterday but its not always a given. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday not a great day I entered a 0dte put this morning when we broke through 388.6 the first time with a 15min candle. We had tons of momentum and VIX was in our favor. However we then saw two full candles with ridiculous wicks to the upside on them. I was looking for a fakeout recovery then further drill that never came. Tough loss there. \n\nEnd of day I entered another 0dte put that eventually saw 50% green only to go to -80% green and then was able to thankfully close it back out for 0% on a quick wick. I fully misplayed that and shoulda taken profits. I had a 100% take profit order set and once again we had all the signs aligning we were going to see a breakdown closer to 386 EOD but it never came. Hindsight I shoulda taken the 50% gains to recover 50% of that morning put loss. Live and learn and die but greed. \n\nI was not going to play any positions over night and honestly I probably shouldn’t have played anything overnight but here I am in a 394C 2dte. When I started to dig into my TA and that 388 support more I felt that was bullish and not bearish. \n\nI entered these UVXY 14.5C this morning when it looked like we were breaking out. They never really saw green as it almost immediately dropped. I am using these as a hedge for the week as I do think by time Friday comes we will have filled the Gap and seen a VIX bounce at 25-26 which will cause a spike in the VIX like usual. I could be wrong but I felt compelled to hold this since its 4dte and I know UVXY loves to move in mysterious ways sometimes. \n\nOverall not a great day for me and further case that if I stopped trading Mondays I would be way more profitable. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcvagcf6v8891.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=627dcda0929c1dd67c288fd6b6e91eb0abd94e42'), ('$AMD on a Times Square billboard last night', "$AMD on a Times Square billboard last nightIt truly is beauty &amp; the beast &amp; a rather handsome beast I might add &amp; since the WSB panel is\xa0unanimously bullish on the semiconductor space, wanna say something.

Although many stocks closed down for the day this was still a constructive and much needed rest after last Friday's large gains. With that being said, don't get overly bullish just yet. We still have a long ways to go before the market shakes off the past few months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jhdv7bhaa891.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e186bb7dfab3c11d679e8e4f2ef1efc8bf6816e6\n\nSPY ran into the 21 day exponential moving average (orange line) right at the opened and quickly reversed. This was not an extremely strong reversal however, with volume lower than Fridays run up and the average daily trading volume. What would be most constructive is if SPY ranged here for a few days to a week and then looked to advance even farther. SPY could also setup for a high-low by trending downwards slightly and then taking out todays highs. Conversely, if we see strong selling in the next few days this may indicate more downwards action. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12taphijaa891.png?width=2256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b0c41e451af189e8656ed8ee9645964af575fd1\n\nQQQ behaved similarly to SPY, however, QQQ actually gapped up above its 21 day exponential moving average (orange line) but still closed slightly below. A week of range trading or even a slight downward trend would be constructive for QQQ as it would give some time before attempting a new advance. \n\n**Recap on recent positions:**\n\nBefore the close on last Thursday I opened two small positions in AMZN &amp; QLD. Both performed very well and Friday and today I was stopped out of both positions. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7l0rfzdlaa891.png?width=2248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ed024dc7d4b36b0f54dcbcb110cf04df6f7908d\n\nMy first shares of AMZN where bought at the pivot point shown by the yellow line. This was at the close of Thursday and as prices began to advance on Friday I bought a small amount of additional shares. Today I sold out of this position for a moderate gain of 1.80%. This is not an eye popping gain but in a choppy/whipsaw market I find it best to take smaller profits.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nezj0aqmaa891.png?width=2254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04d52ecc2ec9c9780f66e7ec933de830349736d6\n\nQLD also turned out to be a nice buy into the close on Thursday. There was a slightly better base/enter here so my initial position was slightly larger. Again, with Fridays price advance I bought additional shares throughout the day. Today I also sold all of my shares for an average gain of 4.30%. Could I have held to a few shares? Yes. Will I regret not? No. If QLD continues to advance there are several additional entry points possible.\n\n**Potential Setups:** \n\nLooking forward there are not many stocks that currently have high probability setups.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n7bqwp5oaa891.png?width=2271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5729199b89cdf2922019bf857601ae98260f3a36\n\nGOOGL was discussed previously and has approached a month long base.

The stock is a generic pharmaceutical oriented business, and I’m writing this post to make a few points and educate you on why this will be one of the best businesses ever to hold, over the long term, even through the recession on the horizon.\n\n(Figure one)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/7zWIhFM](https://imgur.com/a/7zWIhFM)\n\nFrom this you can see they became profitable this year for reasons I shall explore. They are undervalued relative to the overall biopharma sector on a discounted future free cash flow basis, despite their own ventures in the branded pharma business as well. I’m also going to expound on why their risk analysis is a load of bullshit.\n\nFirst off, you should know all pharmaceutical patents expire after 20 years. So Viatris' business is, they take these drugs that have had their patents expire and sell them wholesale. You should notice in the all time chart there is STRONG support at $10.\n\n(Figure two. Green arrow indicates recent capitulation. Dark green arrow represents line of support. Blue line represents where I can see this stock going, through 2024.)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/2AUjycY](https://imgur.com/a/2AUjycY)\n\nIt's $11 after hours. They have 50 billion in assets, 30 billion in total liabilities, market cap of 13.42 billion, and over a billion per year free cash flow (net income after capital expenditure and operating expenditures). 4.34% dividend yield. You should note they cut the dividend a bit to be more aggressive paying off debt earlier this year (From $0.24 per share per quarter, to $0.12 per share per quarter.) Ultimately the right move in my view, anticipating higher interest rates but the market didn't like it, at the time, and it has yet to recover from the drop following the dividend cut. It was up around 5% since its previous Q1 earnings call, May 9th, as of June 27th, 2022, EOD.\n\nOne of the facets of the generic pharmaceutical business is usually a high level of debt and high leverage ratios. Viatris took steps immediately after it’s merger to reduce leverage ratios and pay off debt as fast as possible. Ultimately the right move, they anticipated higher interest rates but the market didn't like it. Recently one of it’s lawsuits on some bullshit about epipen, where they attempted to snuff out competition from other generic competitors, caused a negative EBITDA Q4 but I expect that that will be the last one ever. Viatris was formed via merger with Pfizer’s generics business Upjohn in November 2020, and the only other recent negative EBITDA quarter was the one following that merger, costs factored in include bankers fees, administration transfers, layoffs and hiring changes, so that doesn’t really count. I expect it’s not so much that Pfizer wanted to sell the Upjohn business as much as get some quick cash to fund the COVID-19 vaccine, and avoid the hassle. Whatever the case may be, I expect sailing is smooth by now.  And by cutting the dividend a bit, they can stick with their plan of starting stock buybacks by 2023. (Remember, markets look forwards and not backwards.) They delivered last year to aggressively pay off debt and their focus is mostly on China and Asian markets currently, as they laid out in their May 9th earnings call. I think this is a great move and an attempt to destigmatize medication in the single largest middle class market on earth. Overall I think the leadership is exceptional, they're already a global leader in generics supply and general health (they also run clinics all over the world for general health) and I love the business of generics. I think there's too much R&amp;D that can go into making an ultra niche drug but in the grand scheme, that shit expires in no time, and then it's up for grabs. Hence, the long-run powerhouse cash flow generator status.\n\nUltimately, they're either gonna get bought out by the biggest generics supplier (Novartis) at a huge premium, which probably won't happen because of antitrust and monopoly law. Additionally, Novartis is European and Viatris is American (as well as the largest public or private generics manufacturer on the continent) and they just wouldn’t want all that hassle. Or, and this is the more likely outcome, they're just going to be an outperforming powerhouse undervalued dividend stock with rapidly decreasing debt, a dollar away from the technical floor, and projected to be growing in size for the next few consecutive quarters and beyond (As in, generics are one of the most inflation proof businesses during a recession, because people still need medications and life-saving medication. It has also been shown that people tend to use MORE prescription drugs during recession, which will allow the Company to return dividends and share buybacks to the stockholder. \n\nSo how do you play it? Personally, I think following the expansion in the Chinese markets and the stress and sentiment over there, they will provide yet another earnings beat, beyond what analysts expect or anticipate. Admittedly, the Yuan has weakened since the last earnings call, but not in a very big way, and China is just one aspect of their global business. They also have business in every continent on the world, excluding Antarctica of course, but the strong US dollar is to be considered when trying to anticipate earnings. Keep in mind, this week marks the end of Q2 2022 for all major institutions, and Vanguard is by far the biggest holder of the company, holding 13% of shares in VTI, The Vanguard Healthcare Fund, Midcap fund, and Vanguard Index Fund with a relatively high weighting. If you’ve ever traded a SPY FD, you’ve owned this stock, it has a 1.31% weighting of the overall SPY index fund. With the end of Q2 means the rebalancing of books to overweight outperformers, and the reduction of books of underperformers. One last note, analysts expect the USD index has peaked, and is now declining relative to other currencies, which will provide a huge benefit to US based export companies in the coming years.\n\nSo how do you make money off of it? Well, if you caught this post, you might have a chance of getting a 4-10x bagger. The $12 call for August 19th is 35 cents currently and assuming we have hit a temporary bottom and are currently in a bear market rally, I can see the stock being at between $14 and 16 by then, with earnings August 8th, and maybe a bit of extra time for the late ones to buy in before it reaches a nice price level. (I come to this conclusion using previous support levels, intuition, experience, quantitative experience, and good old fashioned technical analysis support levels.)\n\nAnyways, credit to this guy on twitter I follow, posted some insights on the biopharma sector today, and he mentioned VTRS was his #1 pick which sparked my curiosity and ultimate interest in making this DD. https://twitter.com/dylmags/status/1541441653101191172?s=20&amp;t=CtR\\_WrWQNDhrmQ2mbZw9jA\n\nIf you’re not into FD’s and just want financial security for your future, there are things you can do too. Mainly, designate some index funds with low dividends to this stock with a high one (and they are planning on restoring the dividend of $0.24 per quarter in 2023-2024 along with starting a share buyback program. In the billions of USD. It’s worth considering overweighting this stock in your retirement/college education portfolios yourself, as it will almost certainly not drop below $10 USD in the future and will provide a 4.3% dividend now, along with a doubling of that dividend by at the absolute latest 2024, and continued reinvestment of those dividends will make you quite wealthy in the long run. \n\nTL;DR: No TLDR, I put a lot of work into this, read the whole thing.

Finding support at the 8 day EMA was constructive towards the market rally. However, this is slightly overshadowed by yesterdays price action which was rejected at the 21 day EMA. That combined with the low volume today shows there is little confidence in this rally, at least for now. Breaking below the 8 EMA could signal the start of a new leg down. For now there is little more to do than to watch and wait.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o1k2a6g5nm891.png?width=2261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a7e345a8da13d220c7904a03b710467c6d2f7a\n\nThe story is not much different for QQQ, with the exception that there was slightly more buying volume that in turn led to QQQ closing in positive territory. Both indices could still be setting up for a higher low setup. This would mean that both would base for several more days before breaking out on a large increase in buying volume. This is the bullish scenario. The indices could still base but break out to the downside if negative news comes to light. Setting new lows for the move would mean that we are still in a very weak market that will need significant buying support to turn around.\n\n**Recap on recent positions:**\n\nCurrently I am not holding any positions and unless market action is overwhelming bullish/bearish likely will not add any positions tomorrow.\n\n**Potential Setups:**\n\nThere are also not a lot of high probability setups forming in individual stock or the market indices. Yesterdays selloff caused most stocks that were close to setting up to pullback. If the market is extremely bullish tomorrow, I may open a position as SPY takes out Tuesdays highs. Other than that I see very few high probability money-making setups.\n\n**Bringing everything together:**\n\nFor now it is best to have low exposure in the markets until a clear direction is confirmed. The safest plays will likely be the indices since there are very few individual stocks near buy points. Todays quiet day is still constructive because it allowed some selling to be absorbed without losing to much ground.

You are working at Wendy’s, you are not a trader you are a gambler. Okay so his levels useless to me? No mate, please read the following for you to understand.\n\n\nA support level is a price level where there are more buyers than sellers. This means that the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level . \n\nA resistance level is the opposite of a support level . This means that there are more sellers than buyers. It is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises. Again, this means that the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level . \n\nA previous support level will sometimes become a resistance level when the price attempts to move back up, and conversely, a resistance level will become a support level as the price temporarily falls back. \n\n\nOnce an area or "zone" of support or resistance has been identified, those price levels can serve as potential entry or exit points because, as a price reaches a point of support or resistance, it will do one of two things—bounce back away from the support or resistance level (trading ranges), or violate the price level and continue in its direction (trading breakouts) —until it hits the next support or resistance level \n\nThe basic trading method for using support and resistance is to buy near support in uptrends or the parts of ranges or chart patterns where prices are moving up and to sell/sell short near resistance in downtrends or the parts of ranges and chart patterns where prices are moving down. Buying near support or selling near resistance can pay off, but there is no assurance that the support or resistance will hold. Therefore, consider waiting for some confirmation that the market is still respecting that area \n\nTrading breakouts, a breakout is a potential trading opportunity that occurs when an asset\'s price moves above a resistance level or moves below a support level on increasing volume . The first step in trading breakouts is to identify current price trend patterns along with support and resistance levels in order to plan possible entry and exit points. Once the asset trades beyond the price barrier, volatility tends to increase and prices usually trend in the breakout\'s direction. Breakouts are such an important trading strategy since these setups are the starting point for future volatility increases, large price swings and, in many circumstances, major price trends. When trading breakouts, it is important to consider the underlying asset\'s support and resistance levels. The more times an asset price has touched these areas, the more valid these levels are and the more important they become. At the same time, the longer these support and resistance levels have been in play, the better the outcome when the asset price finally breaks out. Asset prices will often move slightly further than we expect them to. This doesn\'t happen all the time, but when it does it is called a false breakout. Therefore it is important to consider waiting for some confirmation while trading breakouts. \n\nMarkets regularly cycle between clean trend, and choppy consolidation, spending as much as half the time in the consolidation overall. Usually after a large move in market , a consolidation phase occurs. After choppy consolidating phase where price moves between a strong resistance and a strong support a breakout occurs when either strong support fails or resistance broken. \n\nEveryone focuses on being smart. \nBut not being stupid is actually more important. Not being stupid is essential for survival. Do not buy puts as price heads down to strong support. Do not buy calls as price heads up to strong resistance.  Do not buy options when market consolidating. Do not bet it all in one move . You might get lucky and win big but eventually you will lose big. Is better to trade level to level with proper size position using risk management.\n\nBuy calls when strong resistance shatters. Buy puts when strong support fails. Buy options during breakouts when market is trending. Remember after large move expect market to consolidate to be in range for a day or two.\n\n I probably will regret this but I will answer any question regarding support/resistance levels. \n\n\nNot responsible for how you use this information.

This fund has averaged a return of a little under 4% per quarter for the past few years and has more room to grow (especially with inflation running rampant in other countries leading companies to invest in cheaper alternatives).\n\nNext, we have an Egyptian fund (which is one of the largest economies in Africa). This ETF is the Market Vectors Egypt Index and basically is Egypt's $SPY. It has a little over 10% of the fund diversified to a couple other countries including Canada. This fund is quickly growing in net assets each quarter with 2.5% growth, so it is a bit slower than the VanEck but could experience more in the next few years.\n\nThe final ticker I will share is a South African mutual fund. This fund is really weighted with banks and different funds that are operating in Africa which will experience major growth once Africa stabilizes with further investments into the continent from outside countries. Leading up to 2021, this fund was growing at a rate of almost 10% each quarter, which shows the growth that has already occurred in Africa (which is only the beginning).\n\nTo wrap things up, Africa is one of the most untapped regions in the world economically. They are loaded with natural resources and a lot of their countries are starting to get their shit together. With the rest of the world on the downfall (due to shitty governing and supply chain issues), Africa is primed to explode because they have been on a steady rise and are doing nothing but gaining better governing policies.\n\nAnother weird thing I want to point out is that through all of my research, there is a country in Africa starting with every single letter except for K, which is strange. Maybe when we all print our 10 baggers we can start our own country together. Godspeed retards.\n\nTLDR; Africa has a fuck ton of untapped natural resources and is one of the cheapest countries to operate in. They are definitely primed to explode and have already had major growth in the last decade alone."), ('FCC Commissioner Calls For TikTok ban.

I thought that was odd. I checked the daily candle and sure enough… it looked like we touched 380.53. I thought well that’s odd so I checked TOS and webull and they said the same thing! We had only see $4.44 of movement but they were telling us we had seen nearly $8 of movement… And my initial thoughts were a glitch or I miss a 1minute candle blip. Nope all clean and PM never even broke 380. \n\nSo of course I first thoughts are we are going to see then run it to 380.53 range before they dump it… and what did they do? They ran it to 380.66 and IMMEDIATELY reversed it. I don’t know what kind of market fuckery that is right there but I have NEVER EVER seen anything like that before. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3b8zyfxvt891.png?width=289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f0130b45f3d56dca49c56e953be9d2436a6c869\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tg8da76yvt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1674ee23e2705241cd17dd27d401fd1bc45e416\n\nAre we having fun yet?

I suspect us to break through that black dotted support line of 373 tomorrow. \n\nWe now have a red dotted bear channel forming.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lpy24o30wt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c3dbc549c97d2344064c4c9740351b28d4f0e84\n\nIf you note on the daily using the black solid line and the red dotted support line we are actually seeing a huge falling wedge which means we just might see that 300 price target by end of July if things don’t improve. But we are on a clear path to 358 SPY right now. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf4p55r0wt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5453ff594b8e0b9e6163ded15551a6ee3f7c416\n\nThe weekly chart is what interests me the most… we are actually seeing a huge falling wedge forming there with the floor near that 350-358 price range for next week. I have a feeling now that we 1. Rejected breaking through weekly 8ema and 2. Broke down out of blue bull channel we are going to start our next sell off. \n\nWe have been seeing for about the last 6 months now that the last week or first week of a month we get a change of trend… we are now due for a sell off. \n\nAs much as I would love to say this is the time to go long 60-90dte puts I just don’t think it is…\n\nWhat I think we are going to see is that SPY is going to trade between 360-380 until end of July. End of July bring a shit storm of things for us. \n\nWe have Junes FOMC minutes releasing July 6th,  CPI on July 13th, FOMC on July 27th, GDP on July 29th (which most likely will be negative and confirm a recession), and then we also start earnings around the 2nd to 3rd week of July. \n\nI have a feeling earnings are gonna be dog water and with this last two weeks of July shit storm brewing we MIGHT have one more bull week or at least sideways week left in us before we finally see capitulation and get the next move down with a  price target of 300 SPY by September. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nAfter having a killer week in theory that I turned into a shit week by failing to take profits all week out of pure greed I refused to do that today. Had a great day for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v8at4f2wt891.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b3b215780207a2910d530a4714c18fc354fc8a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fvgtxy2wt891.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03252e8319ed9c452339e038bc418ae77f79045a\n\nMy ONLY saltiness about today is I KNEW we were going to sell off EOD when we kept rejecting off of 380 but I was too scared to enter after yesterdays fuckery. I finally entered and had a position up about 40%... I decided to lock in a 25% stop limit sell order on the 0dte JUST IN CASE she turned against me. But I had VERY VERY strong intuition she was gonna see 100%+ profits… Well she triggered at 32% as you can see above in my log. I then only had $26 in BP left so I bought a 0dte 373 to let ride and of course as you can see within 4 minutes it was up well over 100%... It hit 150% at its peak. Had I just held on and believed I would have had 100%+ profits. \n\nBut that’s how this market goes. The days we don’t secure profits like I did today or at least protect us from the downside is the days we get absolutely rocked like I did yesterday. And the days we do take profits are the days it perfectly hits our PT. The 11.4% and 10.7% I played earlier were the same thing a 10% stop limit just in case that triggered and both those went to see 100-200% gains also. This market is such a mind fuck on being able to trust the chart and indicators but also protecting yourself from tom-foolery. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Friendly reminder to anyone NOT in my server\\*\\*\\*   \n I am going to be out of town starting tomorrow as I am flying to vegas/ grand canyon to get married this weekend and then the following weekend will be vacationing to see my family.

The stock's bounce comes after it had lost 8.6% amid a four-day losing streak through Thursday, to end the month of June with a 11.2% decline. NIO Inc. NIO, -0.64%, Li Auto Inc. LI, +0.60% and XPeng Inc. XPEV, -1.12% all reported big increases in June deliveries, both from a month ago and from a year ago, to continue a recovery after a relatively rough April.\n\nSource: [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-bounces-into-positive-territory-after-china-based-rivals-report-upbeat-june-deliveries-2022-07-01?siteid=rss](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-bounces-into-positive-territory-after-china-based-rivals-report-upbeat-june-deliveries-2022-07-01?siteid=rss)\n\n**Tesla (TSLA) is up +0.46% pre-market today.

This makes up about 20% of my portfolio. Plan to keep averaging in until it is 30% of my portfolio. Cost basis per share is \\~$40. Will reevaluate my position once Unity hits 40B market cap or 5 years have passed.\n\n**The narrative:**\n\nSo why be bullish on (U) which has not been profitable so far?\n\nIs it because they are going to be the heart and soul of metaverse software? No! I don’t see that happening for a *long time.*\n\nIs it because their software is in practically every mobile game every made? No! I hate mobile games and think they are stupid (pc master race ftw).\n\nIt is for one simple reason that is more important than any other. **I hate auto desk**. I use auto desk products every day, and this has to be the stupidest least innovative company I have ever seen. Now if you only know about Unity only at a surface level you may be asking yourself, wtf does Autodesk have to do with Unity? Unity is screwing Autodesk in 2 ways (This situation reminds me a lot of AMD vs Intel several years ago)\n\n1). The Weta Digital buyout. Weta makes/innovates/designs special effects. Unity now owns the software and a significant amount of the lead staff. Best known for their special effects in movies such as... Avatar, Lord of the Rings, ***Planet of the Apes.*** This buyout is undervalued imo. It not only gave Unity a major tech boost, but also severally undercut their competitor Autodesk by basically canceling WetaM which Autodesk was expected to benefit from with their “Maya” platform. Ha screw you Autodesk.\n\n2.)  Unity is expanding their presence in manufacturing and architecture. This is a big deal in manufacturing right now and as VR becomes more common Unity is much better positioned to take advantage of virtual tours and allow companies to benefit from prototyping. Nothing sells products like taking your customer on a virtual tour and showing them how it will be made. This a very big deal for industries and the ones embracing it are winning customer contracts. \n\n**Financials:** \n\nUnity is expected to become profitable in Q4 this year as they shift from research/development to profitability. I expect this will involve some moderate layoff numbers this year. I think the decisions they made with their IPO money were great and the Weta Digital purchase last year is really what made me start following this company. \n\nUnity \\~11B market cap Autodesk is 37B as a comparison (lots of room for growth)\n\nUnity is expected to grow Revenue by \\~40% year over year vs Autodesk’s \\~13%.\n\nDebt to Equity Unity 0.72 vs Autodesk’s 3.35 (going to be hard for Autodesk to continue investing in itself)\n\n**Why now?** \n\nUnity has been extremely volatile like many high growth tech companies but has found solid resistance at the $35 dollar level in the last 2months. I think now is the time to start averaging in.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nUnity has been investing in itself for years building up to this moment.

Hear me out why do you think so many buy high and sell low? They see price going up and they buy calls and as soon as they buy the price goes down. They blindly purchase just before a resistance level. Or they see price going down and as soon as they buy puts,  the price starts going up . Again they purchase those puts right into a support level. \n\nI know you are probably not the brightest tool in shed, you are probably on your break from flipping burgers and don’t have much time but listen to me technical analysis works it’s just you are getting your information from morons probably from WSB. The crayon lines you are looking probably are drawn by idiotic barely intelligible functioning members of society. People that you probably run away in real life or at least ignore. \n\nYou have a little of money to gamble. You work hard at Wendy’s. This is your hard earn money. You are tired of been poor.  You decided to buy options. Give yourself a chance with those options.\n\n\nPlease read the following if your tired of losing money.\n\n\nA support level is a price level where there are more buyers than sellers. This means that the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level . \n\nA resistance level is the opposite of a support level . This means that there are more sellers than buyers. It is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises. Again, this means that the price is more likely to "bounce" off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level . \n\nA previous support level will sometimes become a resistance level when the price attempts to move back up, and conversely, a resistance level will become a support level as the price temporarily falls back. \n\n\nOnce an area or "zone" of support or resistance has been identified, those price levels can serve as potential entry or exit points because, as a price reaches a point of support or resistance, it will do one of two things—bounce back away from the support or resistance level (trading ranges), or violate the price level and continue in its direction (trading breakouts) —until it hits the next support or resistance level \n\nThe basic trading method for using support and resistance is to buy near support in uptrends or the parts of ranges or chart patterns where prices are moving up and to sell/sell short near resistance in downtrends or the parts of ranges and chart patterns where prices are moving down. Buying near support or selling near resistance can pay off, but there is no assurance that the support or resistance will hold. Therefore, consider waiting for some confirmation that the market is still respecting that area . \n\nTrading breakouts, a breakout is a potential trading opportunity that occurs when an asset\'s price moves above a resistance level or moves below a support level on increasing volume . The first step in trading breakouts is to identify current price trend patterns along with support and resistance levels in order to plan possible entry and exit points. Once the asset trades beyond the price barrier, volatility tends to increase and prices usually trend in the breakout\'s direction. Breakouts are such an important trading strategy since these setups are the starting point for future volatility increases, large price swings and, in many circumstances, major price trends. When trading breakouts, it is important to consider the underlying asset\'s support and resistance levels. The more times an asset price has touched these areas, the more valid these levels are and the more important they become. At the same time, the longer these support and resistance levels have been in play, the better the outcome when the asset price finally breaks out. \n\nOne small point remaining, false breakouts. A failed break is when the price of a security moves beyond a support or resistance level (breakout) but then reverses course moving back below resistance or above support.\n\nThis is the reason why you need risk management, no strategy will work all the time. Around 25% of time break outs will turn to be false breakouts. Instead of seeing this as a problem , need to see this as an opportunity as a false breakout leads to a potent move opposite of prior price movement. How do you identify false breakouts? Parabolic movements with no pullbacks , if prices moves straight down or straight up have high probability of ending as false breakouts.\n\nA useful indicator Relative Strength Indicator(RSI) . The RSI measures both the speed and rate of change in price movements within the market. The values of the RSI oscillator fluctuate between zero and 100. The Relative Strength Index indicates oversold market conditions when below 30 and overbought market conditions when above 70. During a bull market, RSI values normally sit in the 40 to 90 range, with the 40-50 range seen as support. In a bear market, the reading typically stays within the 10 to 60 range, with the 50-60 zone signaling resistance. You shouldn’t make a decision base solely on RSI but you should be aware of overbrought and oversold conditions specially around strong support/resistance levels. \n\nMarkets regularly cycle between clean trend, and choppy consolidation, spending as much as half the time in the consolidation overall. Usually after a large move in market , a consolidation phase occurs. After choppy consolidating phase where price moves between a strong resistance and a strong support a breakout occurs when either strong support fails or resistance broken. \n\nEveryone focuses on being smart. \nBut not being stupid is actually more important. Not being stupid is essential for survival. Do not buy puts as price heads down to strong support. Do not buy calls as price heads up to strong resistance.  Do not buy options when market consolidating. Do not bet it all in one move . You might get lucky and win big but eventually you will lose big. Is better to trade level to level with proper size position using risk management.\n\nBuy calls when strong resistance shatters. Buy puts when strong support fails. Buy options during breakouts when market is trending. Remember after large move expect market to consolidate, to be in range for a day.\n\nBear markets follow the same formula: Bidless drop, sentiment max bearish, 5-15% rallies, repeat, generating max confusion.\n\n\nRemember if resistance clears than becomes support. If support fails than it becomes resistance. \n\nBest longs are after resistance[prior support ] clears. Best shorts are after support [ prior resistance] fails. Any support/ resistance can reject price’s direction. \n\nHelpful Information \n\nAdam Mancini Twitter - provides ES support/resistance levels and market commentary.

With all these earnings (and a few notable ones like Tesla the week before), FOMC meeting and rate hike (many suspect we see 100bps depending on this weeks CPI) and the q2 GDP reading (which is expected to be negative) we are most likely going to see full on capitulation this week if we haven’t already seen it. I think one way or another the bottom is going to be put in the last week of July. \n\nWhat if im wrong?

I mean like 8.5% or less then MAYBE we don’t see the VIX rocket. That is about the only case I can see for the VIX to stay under 25 and not see the 30s or 40s by the end of the month. However, keep in mind.. the same people who told you that we were going to see peak inflation back in May is now EXPECTING the highest inflation yet at 8.8% consensus/ forecast. \n\nAll I am saying is that the VIX has been behaving very fucky the last month and we got a very short spike before we all of a sudden dumped after the June CPI/ FOMC… Its almost like they wanted to get the VIX back under control and back to the low 20s before July.

I got way too caught up in work, holiday shenanigans, and lots of other BS. However, I am finally back on my horse and I am ready to bring some more smooth-brained DD to you all. I have been on a bit of a cold streak lately with my positions but I’ve got a feeling this is the Aaron Judge 450 foot homer I have been seeking. What I will be doing with this post is simply a general DD on the current state of the market. I am going to present topics and attempt to give as objective a take as one man can. Full disclosure however in that before even diving into any research, I myself am very bearish on the markets in the short term. What I will be taking a position in come market open tomorrow is the SPY ETF. For those of you who have consumed more crayons than myself, the SPY ETF refers to the S&amp;P 500 index and is weighted accordingly to the index fund itself. It is heaviest in technology stocks (24.66%) however it is very diverse also holding healthcare (15.08%), financial services (12.86%), consumer cyclical (10.66%), communication services (9.1%), industrials (8.14%), consumer defensive (7.28%), energy (4.18%), utilities (2.99%), real estate (2.86%), and basic materials (2.19%). Additionally, the top 10 individual holdings within SPY are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Class A), Alphabet (Class C), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, UnitedHealth, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Nvidia. In total they make up 27.72% of SPY’s total assets. All that being said, let’s dive into this irrational cesspool that we currently call a market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y2xib5knh1b91.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6645aa1cbf239abdc0b177dc67743bdbaed53d3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsumer Price Index (June YoY &amp; MoM) \\- Wednesday\n\nThe consumer price index is expected to come in at an annual rate of 8.8% year over year with month over month expected to come in at 0.6%. As everyone knows, inflation has been running rampant and crushing economists' expectations lately leading to the current falls in general markets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBull Take\n\nWell, if the CPI comes in at or under economists expectations I believe a massive market rally will ensue on the news that will unfortunately cause some damage to the puts that I plan on partaking in. The reason the market will rally is simply because that would show inflation has possibly peaked and therefore Jerome Powell and our central bank may consider not being as hawkish and utilizing a less aggressive rate hike at their next meeting in a few weeks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBear Take\n\nIf the CPI comes in above already lofty expectations, I expect the market to take another dive back to previous lows set in June, quite possibly surpassing them in the coming weeks. This would be because in addition to the surprise in total nonfarm payrolls smashing expectations, this would show that the U.S. economy is still running hot currently and the 75 basis point rate hike discussed at the most recent FOMC Minutes would be more than justified. In an unbelievably red hot inflation scenario, word could spread of a possible full percent (100 bps) hike which would undoubtedly obliterate the SPY and cause puts to more than print. My evidence for this statement is to look at what the market did in June after ONE 75 basis point hike and high CPI data. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRetail Sales (MoM) - Friday \n\nRetail sales are expected to come in at 0.9% for the month of June. Previously, Retail sales came in at -0.3% which should in theory signal a possible coming recession due to the slower consumption of retail goods by Americans. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBull Take\n\nIf Retail Sales come in below expectations or especially if they come in negative this time yet again, this also will signal an incoming recession and again could trigger the Fed to lighten up on the rate hikes which could cause a bullish bounce of sorts or even a market rebound as investors come to expect the easy money to return to the markets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBear Take\n\nIf retail sales come in above expectations this will signal consumers still have money in which they are willing to spend on retail goods which will incline the Fed to be more hawkish, which again would cause the markets to dump. Should we get a high CPI in conjunction with high retail sales, a 75 basis point rate hike at the next Fed meeting has a much higher probability of occurring. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMichigan Consumer Sentiment\n\nFirst, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment is a monthly survey of how consumers feel about the economy, personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions. The University of Michigan conducts at least 500 phone calls and covers personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions over 50 questions with US consumers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBull Take\n\nIronically, if US consumer sentiment drops to new all time lows this will be bullish for the market as again it will try to lean the Fed into a more dovish position and perhaps only hike rates 50 bps instead of the discussed 75 bps. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBear Take\n\nConsumer sentiment rallies, defying expectations and shows optimism among American consumers. Again, if this and the CPI both follow the bearish take or all 3 I personally believe that this will be too much for markets and puts on the SPY will be in for some tendies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy Personal Opinion\n\nMuch of this is crystal ball guesswork my friends. I cannot tell you what will occur and if I could I wouldn’t still be giving dandy handies behind the Wendy’s dumpster. However, I do believe that CPI will come in higher than expected. This is due to past CPI coming in hotter than expected and most importantly this data is for the month of June. Energy prices, especially oil went berserk for the entirety of June which should carry CPI above expectations alone. Not only that but literally anything I have bought has continued to go up in price on a literal monthly basis. While my Hoosier ass is by no means a proxy for the entirety of inflation and the economy it is still telling. \n\nAdditionally, I believe that one of the two following economic indicators (retail sales or consumer sentiment) will also follow a path that makes the Fed have to raise interest rates by at least 75 bps at their meeting in a few weeks. It is this interest rate raise that I believe will crush markets at least in the very near future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExit Plan:\n\nBy all means get greedy if you guys would like but I figured I would post my own thoughts for how I plan to proceed. I am going to buy 3 SPY $380 8/19 Puts at market open tomorrow morning. This is to get ahead of the economic indicators occurring this week and quite possibly make a nice 25% on my investment before the market even closes Friday. Personally I believe these contracts could do so by then and I would be happy with a \\~$750 gain in a few days on a \\~$3,000 investment. \n\nIf I am wrong though and these contracts lose value as the market decides to rally, I will be doubling down on my position, putting all of my capital in and scooping up as many contracts as I can. I will more than likely do so on Friday after Retail Sales and Consumer Sentiment data to hopefully get the best price per contract. \n\nIn a worst case scenario, I will sell at a loss, selling all of my contracts on August 1st before Theta begins to obliterate my sweet cheeks more than it already will have by that point. This would be done to save some capital and have a chance at recouping my losses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR \n\nHigher than forecasted inflation + Higher than forecasted Consumer sentiment + Higher than forecasted Retail Sales = JPow hiking rates and sending us full speed ahead into a recession, crushing equities and therefore making lots of money for bears.

We then will for the next 2 weeks while we wait for FOMC, earnings and GDP continue to dump (I made a post last night about going long on VIX/ UVXY calls I definitely recommend you read it as it adds to all of this too). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9jfishi47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1ce646bbdfe5b81247539cc0abdb93511072043\n\nI will be SHOCKED if CPI is anything but 9% but I took profits on almost everything but my UVXY calls cause I don’t trust this market or the fed lol. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/drqk190j47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9b811ecb36df38de701e9ef660dc0f803812893\n\nOverall the daily looks clear as to where we are going… I mentioned last week we looked to be in a 370 to 390 channel and that is exactly what this week has played out as. I would be shocked if we don’t see 370 tomorrow (-2.7% day). If we break through 370 and close under it this week I think we are going to be setting up for 340-350 by EOM. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aaih33lj47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e429b5ba985120726ee44900f825a15aa780105\n\nMonday I called out the 3810 level for ES futures that I expected us to see. Here we are hitting it intraday today. PT for futures is 3675 by EOW (-4% from 3820). Overall we finally see a close below the daily 8ema on ES futures which we were waiting for to have confirmation of down trend. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvzov25k47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb6fc1e00bc53da78f0f83ac0b9dff88277ab6ea\n\nThe one weird outlier today was the VIX. Even with that massive 1.3% sell off EOD today from 1pm to 345pm we never saw the vix break 28. Which tells me that the VIX (fear) did not lead this sell off but rather sheer volume. We had some pretty low sell pressure for how strong of a sell off we had though. We only saw -1.5 at the peak when most big dumps see -5 to -10. \n\nI am highly expecting the VIX to finally spike tomorrow when the market get rocked by a 9% CPI. A 25% vix day is likely and would put VIX near 35. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1x4agyk47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12bd0b8710ab0331cc1f04d977c82cea0168bdca\n\nOverall the server had a great day today.

Great day overall for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ht4w0ol47b91.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b47abe9addc123b95552ba8c4f433de0c3376af3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvcmcv2m47b91.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=733818a597f13c3debc2f3fef92a2ead5ef812a1\n\nMy plan WAS to carry some 5 otm puts overnight. However, I decided to take proifits on everything instead. I also wanted to hold those 3dte puts till Friday but I just couldn’t say no to the gains. While I have high conviction we see a bad CPI and a big dump tomorrow im not chancing gains if I don’t have to.   \n \n\nI decided to hold my UVXY calls as I still have not see the VIX spike that we are waiting for. The fear hasn’t hit the market yet and tomorrow it will. And if im wrong then im wrong but with these UVXY calls in the off chance that CPI isn’t too bad I should be able to get out still with a small loss. It was the smartest play.

Twitter argues that it has every right to do so under a specific performance provision in the deal contract.\n\nThe company, with the help of lawyers at Wachtell (which has also worked for Musk), set fire to Musk’s efforts to drop the bid, which it argued were more about the drop in Tesla’s shares and its effect on Musk’s wealth than anything else.\n\n“Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,” the company said in the suit, adding: “Musk apparently believes that he — unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law — is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.” (Musk has not responded to a request for comment.)\n\nHere is what else Twitter said:\n\nThe company gave Musk everything and more on spam accounts, contrary to Musk’s claims that Twitter stonewalled his efforts to get the information he needed to close the deal. But even then, Twitter claims, Musk’s demands became progressively more irrational.\n\n“From the outset, defendants’ information requests were designed to try to tank the deal,” the lawsuit reads. “Musk’s increasingly outlandish requests reflect not a genuine examination of Twitter’s processes but a litigation-driven campaign to try to create a record of noncooperation on Twitter’s part.”\n\nBots do not count as a “material adverse effect” that would justify canceling the deal, despite Musk’s claims that Twitter’s regulatory disclosures, which state that about 5 percent of its accounts are bots, were intentionally misleading. Twitter explicitly said in its regulatory filings that the figures were estimates. And Musk cited fixing the problem of spammers and bots as a primary reason he wanted to buy Twitter, according to the suit.\n\nOn April 9, the day Musk said he wanted to acquire Twitter rather than join its board, he texted Twitter’s chairman, Bret Taylor, to say “‘purging fake users’ from the platform had to be done in the context of a private company because he believed it would ‘make the numbers look terrible,’” the suit reads.\n\nTwitter ran its business in “ordinary course,” meaning consistent with how it previously ran things. Breaking an “ordinary course” provision has gotten a buyer out of a deal before, notably AB Stable’s acquisition of MAPS Hotels and Resorts during the height of the pandemic. Musk accused Twitter of breaking its ordinary course when it, among other things, slowed hiring and fired two executives without telling him.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/business/dealbook/elon-musk-twitter-lawsuit.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/13/business/dealbook/elon-musk-twitter-lawsuit.html)\n\nTwitter filed a lawsuit yesterday in an effort to pressure Elon Musk to finalize his $44 billion acquisition of the company.

In an effort to lure more subscribers, Netflix has increased its content spend, particularly on originals. To pay for it, the company hiked prices of its service. Netflix said those price changes are helping to bolster revenue but were partially responsible for a loss of 600,000 subscribers in the U.S. and Canada during the most recent quarter.\n\nNetflix has been interviewing potential partners for the past several months, including Google and Comcast, as it prepares to launch the tier before the end of 2022. \n\nUnlike Google, which owns YouTube, and Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal’s Peacock, Microsoft doesn’t operate a competing streaming service to Netflix.\n\nPeters said the ad-efforts are still in the “very early days,” with “much to work through.”\n\nNetflix is slated to release quarterly earnings Tuesday.

With the halt, many provincial governments are financially crippled with **hidden debts suspected to be up to 50% of Nationwide GDP** ( [LINK](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3160566/chinas-hidden-corruption-problem-behind-local-debts-goes-hand?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article&amp;campaign=3160566)) .

Many banks offered retarded investment packages instead of actual bank accounts to citizens. These investment packages either included the suspicious provincial government’s land rights as debt or were outright scams. Consequently many citizen’s money were not picked up by China's main bank. With zero liquidity, banks closed online access and became really hostile to anyone who was asking for their money. The subsequent bank runs are creating unprecedented demonstrations to force the regulatory commission to release frozen funds ([link](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/banking-waves-china-release-frozen-bank-funds-after-rural-protests-203568)). These bank runs are deeply systematic and need government intervention and will no doubt cause further strain on Chinese incomes. \n\nSpeaking about their infrastructure projects, their water dams are partially to blame for the massive floods throughout China. China currently has thousands of Dams, both active and abandoned. Some active Dams are in deep disrepair due to lack of provincial resources([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07136-0)). With increased rainfall reported throughout the region, the integrity of these Dams are threaten. These officials will suddenly open the flood gates to claim no fault. These floods are specifically pushed towards the rural towns and destroying food production in the South. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese food shortages are recognized by the Government. China implemented a Great Leap Forward in food production by forcing local governments to make more food([link](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/china-seed-industry-seeks-better-laws-support-innovation-318341)). China is also encouraging citizens to limit food waste through either subtle messaging or ordering restaurants to limit the amount of food given. \n\nFood Shortages have been compensated by the increased import of food. China currently projects to import **100 Million Metric Tons of SOYBEANS** from the Global Market ([link](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/blogs/agriculture/060722-china-climate-change-food-security)).

Their “election” is in November with numerous concerns of fighting off his political Rivals. The humiliation he has been experiencing with his COVID Zero Policy and his Trade War with Australia and USA has been damaging to China economically. \n\nXi is unlikely to lose however he does need to show strength within his party soon. He needs a solution that can give him absolute control over the country when you cannot simply print expensive infrastructure bills and ignore rural workers. \n\n# Their Solution? Taiwan. (But not what you think)\n\nNothing brings people together like a time of war.\n\n**(Insert American Patriotic Theme)**\n\nWe all know the memes and shit posting. We also know China has significantly increased military spending for the past two decades ([Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China)). However people believe that China will simply attempt to blitz over the 180km strait to invade without a plan. I suspect China will want a quick victory that the West will hopefully ignore and give the Party including Xi a propaganda win at home. \n\nI do not believe Taiwan itself is in immediate trouble, its islands it controls nearby China are in trouble. Taiwan’s Kinmen islands are less than 10km (6 miles) from China’s shore. Recently China has been increasingly harassing Taiwan by invading their airspace([link](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-chinese-military-is-flying-more-combat-aircraft-near-taiwan-2022-7)).  This required Taiwan to respond with their air force in a fight of maintenance attrition from Taiwan repairing their planes.

However they would increase pressure for a peaceful resolution via Sanctions and weapons deliveries to Taiwan similar to the Russian-Ukraine War. Eventually leading down towards artillery bombardment and sea blockades to starve each island out similar to the first two Taiwan Strait Crisis-es. However I suspect they could leverage their dealings with Russia and their Belt and Road “Pals” to compensate for the sanctions. Regardless this will lead to a globalization breakdown filled with panic and massive sell offs.\n\nThe real question comes as China begins to eat up islands belonging to Taiwan. I suspect a positive feedback loop of further investment away from China and China slowly eating up the Islands closest to them and using conquered islands as launching bases. This can increase Nationalistic Fervor within China regardless of how poor the citizens will become. \n\n# Miscellaneous Notes I cannot find a spot for them\n\n* Citizens discontent in passive aggression.

The biggest advocate for TSLA was Cathie Wood, the most reputable Ponzi scheme creator from near history. The company TSLA hired Elon Musk (social media artist) with contracts that promise options if the stock market reaches some sort of price. No one was interested in EVs in that days. (he made a good job with the driving assistant)\n\nThe climate news media exuberance started. The world begins to die in 2060 if nobody does something. If we do not start now, the world will suffer severe, irreversible damage. These sorts of stories get the attention, because they are reasonable to the reader. The real attention happened in times of Corona. At this point the human experienced a "spiritual relationship" with the nature because he could not go outside.\n\nThe next part was the historic stimulus that reminded the central bankers of what they actually learned in school and how inflation works. All parts come together as the TSLA makes a profit. The investment world suddenly out of nowhere realized that EVs are the future despite the fact that in the past several companies tried the H2O and EV approaches but in the past, EVs weren\'t simply the trend. Sadly for them, they followed soon, and some competitors emerged (these are the people that ride the trend, make unlimited money, because of the euphoria, and do not care in the end). New companies with the goal to compete in the EV market. \n\nAll of them and the tech sector took the money like a sponge with the simple story of the future and unlimited prosperity. The politicians and policymakers didn\'t warn, they loaded up and surfed on the money wave.\n\nThis was probably the last ride on a stimulus-Ponzi-wave in the mid-future. All the companies already made money from issuing new stocks, and all the people that exploited this period already cashed out. The future was sold, and this future is not coming.

Note how the average also made a lower high just before this decline, coinciding with turmoil and indecision we've been seeing in the equities markets lately.  What this tells me is money is starting to position itself bullish but since we had SO MUCH selling recently, it just takes time to turn the ship around.\n\n**US Dollar:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtuozxglr5c91.png?width=5708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a31f1c4295c49e1354fa5809872cc99fcec3a417\n\nOn it's face, we appear to be inside of an uptrend, but closer inspection shows that this channel is expanding (typically a bearish sign).  Pair that up with the bearish divergence in the RSI and SLIGHT divergence in the PPO, I think we see a pull back here over the next week or so.  Do I think the Dollar is going to crash?  LOL, NO...  BUT we should see some relief soon.\n\n**Bond Yields:**\n\nWe're still inverted on the 10's and 2's which is not a good sign for the financials, as we saw last week on earnings...

What the actual fuck is going on around here? But to be fair it makes sense…. It makes sense that they would do it on a random ass day instead of when we all expected it and were all positioned for it. \n\nNow the question is…. Was this a over reaction or was this the beginning of the next big leg down? My vote? I think we bounce tomorrow and maybe once tesla reports we actually go down… That’s my opinion… Ta wise it could go either way. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fok0jak40ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28e30b1eb997165164e0ebd3f9bcd3aca5ec195\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8to2o250ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=840ae7b2280e9298a3a0834da27c61ea9469adc2\n\nIf you look at SPY and ES futures weekly chart you can see we broke out upwards from the descending wedge which should be bullish, however, they both perfectly rejected their weekly 8ema. That rejection is actually more bearish than the resistance line break out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sprxl9q50ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271a9db03de763e23746f08626cf09190fcb016f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntcoltd60ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6226f5d610bd7127cbefa47c3dd81dd91296839f\n\nNow the daily charts for SPY and Es futures look pretty bearish to me. On SPY we see we nearly perfectly tapped the downward tan channels resistance line and came just short of the sideways purple resistance line too. This tells me we have more to go down. If you look at the next chart below you can see we had a similar movement on April 21st and similar sized candle red on that day. We could be seeing the next big move of the market over the next month or so if this resistance rejection holds true. \n\nLooking at the ES futures you see that we broke the blue dotted resistance line which would be bullish but we rejected the purple channel. You can see by the blue arrows that everytime we have hit these we have reversed course. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn8d7kx60ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8da2c39629dce6d99bfccd78b654229ca5cd6583\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2chkbae70ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4f188db42685b93d2a5969f55409edca7fdc81b\n\nAnd then we have the vix… it attempted to break back into that key 25.5 level today and even saw 25.91 at its peak today but overall I would still venture to say that the VIX is not onboard yet for the next leg down. The only reason im not saying its time to go heavy into some puts here or uvxy/ VIX calls is because of how the VIX reacted today… I feel like it more naturally reacted today but it still didn’t quite spike and hold like we would have expected. I would and will be bearish longer term once we break through 26.7 VIX. \n\nI still think this could have easily been a market over reaction to the Apple news. If it was a over reaction then we will see a pop tomorrow and most likely see a green day tomorrow. Unless some more news about tech come out tomorrow there really isn’t anything until Tesla earnings Wednesday night that would really move the markets. I would be careful here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjbg4z380ec91.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4b31fa3f1c4cb7ce18bde07fec966420437a23c\n\nI also would be careful until this breaks back under 20k. Hoping that a picture of it wont result in my post getting removed… but I think this being so green today is a big hint of whats to come. I wont be full bear thill this breaks back under 20k and holds. \n\nBull case for SPY/ ES-\n\nDespite the big sell off today we managed to close at that key 382 support. It is an adjusted close to just slightly under 382.23 which is the daily 8ema… Looking at Fridays candle we do see a possible double bottom forming here at 382 and the wicks at 380.6. The VIX has not fully committed to the next drop yet and until we really see that break and fly over 26.6 we most likely are going to hold what we got. We do have to keep in mind that today could have been a true market over reaction which we have seen time and time before. It could be argued that this new was used as a chance to fill the big gap up we had overnight and that now that the gap is filled we should reverse. \n\nBear case for SPY/ ES- Markets have been looking for a reason to dump and this might finally be the reason. With a resistance line rejection of two key channels this morning with a failure to break through that is bearish. This morning even before the apple new markets had SPY pinned within a &lt;$2 range for almost the whole day till the sell off started. After blowing through key 385 support and now closing under the daily 8ema and 382 support it is only natural that we could see 378.8 to fill the gap below us. We also have a fully engulfing bear candle on the daily now\n\nDaily support for SPY- 382 -&gt; 378.8 -&gt; 375.1 -&gt; 370.6\n\nDaily support for ES- 3795 -&gt; 3744 -&gt; 3671\n\nDaily resistance for SPY- 385 -&gt; 387.3 -&gt; 390.3\n\nDaily resistance for ES- 3915 -&gt; 4020\n\nI feel bearish long term still but short term im not ready to be bearish enough to hold anything. I would have like it better had we stopped at 385 and formed a doji at the top on all the dailys to help with a clear reversal. This fat massive candle is not quite the reversal candle we would expect. The case for both channel resistance rejection is quite strong but we haven’t had back to back trend days in a very long time and all last week no matter what happened buyers ate everything up and we even saw that today. \n\nOverall I see two scenarios\n\n1) We will hold support here at 382 and back test resistance at 385. A rejection at 385 would be a more compelling top/ reversal case than we have here. I also wouldn’t be surprised to see the 388.5 resistance retested tomorrow either. If we see that then we can get not only a TRUE double top on the daily but we can also get a true tan channel resistance rejection. That would be a case for me to feel and stay feeling bearish. \n\n2) If we are seeing the next leg down it will start with filling the gap at 378.8. This is going to be key with what happens next. Most times a gap fills we do see a reversal so that is something we would need to keep in mind. However, if the VIX finally gets on board or we get anymore big tech bad news we might see this sell off continue. I would need VIX &gt;26.6 to believe in it though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rih5eov90ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947ffa2808f2d51357fea2154c30e4b50847a921\n\nAMD actually looks fairly bearish here on the daily with this hanging man doji. This is the type of candle I wanted to see on ES or SPY today to really sell the top but we didn’t get it. AMD did fill their daily gap though so I would be surprised if we see a back test of support at 79.5. If that 79.5 support holds there is a pretty big case to be made for 87.2 still especially with the CHIP bill being voted on tomorrow. However, if 79.5 fails we just might see a back test of that 71.6 support. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a GREAT day that I turned into a GOOD day thanks to greed and also playing it safe. All morning I hated the trend and I recognized the range super early which was great. The news broke out and I was able to get some nice plays in. I was not expecting this level of dump today and was definitely expecting this to be an over-reaction and recovery intraday especially since VIX wasn’t on board. Made some great gains and then at 2pm I made my error but going in on another 0dte OTM 381p. They burnt me with the choppiness and I finally decided to close for -41.7% after it bounced and bounce and bounced around. Little did I know had I just held on a little longer… it woulda been a 6x position by EOD. \n\nDays like today are the hardest because its the time of day that if you just hold on long enough everything will be green. But days like today make the next day even harder. Because then we have this false safe feeling that “well if I just hold them imma get green.” And then we just keep holding and averaging down and it just keeps getting redder and redder until we realize we are too burn to even salvage anything. In this market we have to salvage our losses and mitigate our risk/ loss. \n\nTodays biggest lesson was 0dtes are still a great trade but EOD OTM 0dte are a big struggle. Had I just gone ATM like I usually do I wouldn’t have gotten burnt like that and felt the need to sell. I will not be playing these OTM again until days like FOMC when we fully expect the big move before it happens. \n\nAlso had I just sat with my $1200 profits I would have been very happy but instead I ended up with just over $600 in profits. Tough day to trade today for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1kssaara0ec91.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf024f4b26c14ec236e5216c24063d10cbe20490'), ("With that bod it's no wonder Elon gets all the ladies.

Wow what an unbelievable day to actual watch.\n\nLet me get this straight… Yesterday 389 was like some massive wall of resistance that was nearly impossible to break through and then we proceeded to have a $8+ sell off (some will argue fueled by apple news) but now all of a sudden… we are back to bull town and just have a massive $10.32 green day? Am I understanding that correctly? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x108a69bdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=175faa3511afd8efed68c3ccd2e3ed85f1147a7f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qnecirqbdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04407cf0e0b47547701c892723115baf3b4c2d6a\n\nThe daily turned out to be hella bullish and despite a VERY good chance to close under that KEY 390.2 resistance it decided to push higher EOD and hold for a bullish close. \n\nCouple big things to note here…. \n\n1. We broke through the tan downward channel resistance this resistance dates all the way back to April…. That’s a huge break \n\n2. We broke through and CLOSED a candle over the 390.2 purple sideways channel resistance for the first time since June 10th.\n\n3. We also closed a FULL candle over the daily 8 and 20ema for the first time since June 6th. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39bye3bcdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e39a8fe36ee8528735e0cb3339d8faf466adec18\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8esll45ddlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd51fd30d8dec6191b00ba9c799c69a5f2a614c7\n\nSo here is our updated Daily chart… what do you see? \n\nI see a MASSIVE symmetrical triangle breakout/ break down pattern forming… we just bounced off support when we hit 371 and now it looks like we will go test resistance which will be near 402 with this current trajectory. Why is 402 significant? Well there is a massive gap left on the daily that dates back to June from 395.78 to 401.44. \n\nLets take a look at the weekly now…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlkxscxddlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f4a83aa5cb7a62762e32adf7c58ac98b1101cf2\n\nI mentioned earlier in the week the descending triangle was broken but we do have a new one we are working on right now. The interesting thing about the weekly is that this is the first time since June 6th that we have seen SPY trend over the weekly 8ema. We have cleared a crucial resistance of 389 on the weekly chat and I will be looking for 397 this week and 410-415 next week if this momentum keeps up. \n\nKey support for bulls tomorrow is now that 388.9 and 390.2 level. If it happens to get back tested it will be crucial that they hold it. But solidifying that support would lead to more bullish upside. However, the current support line shows that we will hold above 390.5. Bulls will be targeting 397.4 minimum tomorrow and closer to 401.6 for a true gap fill. It has been Since May 26th and May 27th that we have gotten back to back 2%+ green days. I am curious to see if we get that type of pop again tomorrow. \n\nBears are going to look to break down that 390.5 support line that’s we have been trending on since the 371 support test. If they break that down they will want to see 382 support broken. \n\nLooking at this daily chart I was correct yesterday when I said I didn’t feel like that red candle was a true reversal candle… granted I didn’t feel like we would hit that sort of green today and I really didn’t think we would break 390.2. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgi1kajedlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4da02a1f210232cac49d78eecfdbfdb8c0da40c1\n\nFutures is looking fairly similar to SPY.. it broke its sideways purple channel and yesterday it broke the same resistance line that SPY broke intraday today… chart wise it does appear ES is proceeding what SPY is going to do. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0v219s5hdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ae7d4e02e1c0b87ea617d90b3d3f81352a8082b\n\nFutures with a pretty clear trend also just like SPY. Symmetrical breakout triangle with support hit just on July 14th at 3724. Es closed a candle over 3920 for the first time since June 9th which is very bullish. I am also seeing that intraday today ES tested its daily 50ema for the first time since June 3rd. I will be watching Futures closely over night to see how it interacts with 3950. \n\nBull levels to watch- 3950 à 4000 à 4090.\n\nCurrent bull channel resistance for a break out is at 4010.\n\nBear levels to watch – 3920 à 3875 (support line for this bull run) à 3827. \n\nIf bulls can keep this momentum up and they can close this over the daily 50ema tomorrow of 3850 that is going to lead to some extremely bullish momentum for the end of the week and next week. However, if bears finally step back in tomorrow and reject the 50ema we might see a larger break down and back test that 3875 support which is that fails I believe we are on the path back to 3827. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f2b771fidlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ff58fd7fb3ca932f61ff8633d083d7574194d5\n\nThe ES futures weekly I am very curious where we are going to go here… We still have a descending wedge we are watching and looking to see that broken at the 3970 level. We are also seeing us trade over the weekly 8ema for the first time since early June. Overall you can see we have 3 major levels on ES futures right now. The bottom level is 3675, the middle level is 3905 and the upper level (our current upside target) is 4160. \n\nRight now we have clearly bounced off the bottom 3675 level and after what looks like 4 weeks of consolidation bouncing off this 3905 level… we look ready to breakout to the upside. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nb6a40jdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a66c1a6725df17f520a3bd9c46f78124b17d2c9d\n\nAnd then we have the VIX… this thing I just can not figure out. SPY just put in nearly a 3% green day and it acted like we just chopped at 0% all day long. The VIX essentially reacted the exact same to a -2% drop as it did a 2%+ rip. What does that mean exactly? Well I am still unsure on this to be honest. On one hand I feel the market is pretty numb to all news and I have mentioned a few times now that the 200weekly ema bounce at 363 COULD have been bottom and the vix is going to slowly unwind down. On the otherhand I feel like we are getting such wild volumes right now (watching VOLD and VOLSPD intraday) that its just trumping anything the VIX wants to do. Bullish? Or bearish? Im still unsure as next week is still going to be a hell of a big potential shit storm with I believe its 70% of SPYs earnings reporting this or next week, FOMC, and GDP…\n\n10% Challenge-\n\nToday was a tough day for me. I had a massive struggle believing in this bull day and believing we would see this strong of a bull day. For the last pretty much month we have been living in chop land. And I have relied heavily on the improbable/ probable highs and lows of the day based on IV (this is a think or swim indicator you can add to your chart). For about the last month (really until this last week) we have seen the Probable lows/ highs act as walls and they have been great levels to scalp reversals and to scalp momentum from and to. Today we hit 388 which was the probable IV low of the day and that was also resistance from yesterday. We chopped at 389.7 resistance for almost 2 hours before we finally pushed higher and we broke the improbable high of day of 391.4 around 145pm. From there we just kept rejecting and retesting this support level. I was able to get in two nice scalps here a call and a put at this level. Power hour I decided I was going to play the reversal off of 392.7 and I was expecting us being nearly $1.5 over the improbable high that we would see a reversal and a dump EOD. Of course that is not what happened. Took a hard loss on that scalp there but I still got 3 days to turn this week around to green. \n\nMy current struggle is that for the last month… really the last 6 months now… we have experience this WILD reversal swings and WILD 1-2% dumps. As much as I would LOVE spy to return to a consistent market and trend I am very hesitant to expect such things from it. With the VIX seemingly plateaued at this 24-25 level the last few days everything has been volume driven. Watching VOLD and VOLSPD end of day today despite them running non stop bull all day today they really broke out EOD and drove SPY even higher. \n\nPerhaps we are getting back to a market where we can trust the trend and actually rely on the 8ema for support and resistance. Perhaps we… for now… are past these massive reversal and massive swings. I will be watching intraday tomorrow to see if we are getting back to levels where we can trust a play to run for the day instead of closing it with a quick scalp. But my lesson the last two or three days has been to trust the volume not the VIX. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bffoxnqjdlc91.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821bec54bd51bec763654a4b8fc87048319cd881\n\nI played a OTM Netflix (very small lotto) play today I was tempted to and should have closed it EOD but didn’t. Being that Netflix is up 7.5% right now im pretty sure she gonna be nothing at open. The guidance call on Netflix will be very interesting. But the expected move at 14%+ for Netflix today so either way unless we massively dump this was a losing trade. My one and only earnings play. \n\nAfter seeing all the bullish momentum the last two days and really the last week and the 390/ 3920 levels being broken and closed over I decided to play this call overnight. I have a feeling with Netflix beating (not that I really think they could have taken the markets down) and now with tesla tomorrow night we will get one more bull day. \n\nI honestly think a 401.5 gap fill is possible tomorrow… it would be a 2.4% green day for SPY. I would not be surprised to see a gap up tomorrow either and a 1%+ green open for SPY. \n\nWe left the 379.05 to 380.54 and 369.38 to 370.18 gaps down below. My thoughts are we are finally going to fill this 401.5 gap and then we can position ourselves bearishly for the next week. It’s the perfect storm… bull week leading into the black swan week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/giq4xv8kdlc91.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e22723f16066256d94c7eb6819de2e257234ff8'), ('What Stocks Are Politicians Buying/Selling?

Terms of his exit are still being worked out.\n\n    Afshar declined to comment. Tesla and Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\n    The internal investigation, led by Tesla Acting Head of Legal David Searle, started after a purchase order for construction material was identified as suspicious, the people said.\n\n    The order, for a special kind of glass, was flagged to Tesla’s finance and internal audit groups earlier this year, the people said. Investigators are trying to determine whether the glass was for Tesla Chief Executive Officer Musk’s personal use, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\n    Global supply chain disruptions have made the glass difficult to secure, but Tesla’s status as a global manufacturing powerhouse makes it easier for the company to acquire materials in high demand.\n\n    Afshar had requested the purchase order be created and told the workers involved it was for a secret project, the people said.\n\n    Afshar has continued to work at the Austin, Texas, plant this week, but is likely to take a leave of absence as the investigation continues, the people said.\n\n    As one of Musk’s top executives at Tesla, Afshar has been in charge of overseeing the construction and then production at the plant in Austin, Texas. A member of the office of the CEO since 2017, his most recent job title was listed on his LinkedIn page as a cowboy hat emoji.\n\n    Inside Tesla, Afshar was seen as Musk’s fixer, dispatched to smooth out kinks in the operation. In a 2019 interview at the University of California at Irvine, his alma mater, Afshar said he’d performed many roles at Tesla over the years.\n\n    “I focus on where there’s a problem, so a lot of firefighting. If there’s an issue, that’s where I am,” he said. “Usually when people see me they’re not always happy, because it means there’s a problem.”\n\n    Afshar graduated from UC Irvine in 2009 with a degree in biomedical engineering and a season’s experience as a ski instructor at California’s Mammoth Mountain, according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked for more than six years at St. Jude Medical Inc. and its acquirer, Abbott Laboratories, in product engineering and managing roles before joining Tesla, part of a cohort of young, ambitious executives handpicked by Musk to carry out orders.\n\n    He’s been a jack of all trades ever since. In early 2021, as the US was in the beginning stages of a Covid-19 vaccine rollout, Afshar wrote to California’s lead epidemiologist to convey a Tesla board member’s request to assist with distribution of the shot. By this year, Afshar was in Austin, providing tours to potential recruits from the nearby University of Texas. He briefly appeared on stage at Tesla’s Cyber Rodeo event in April, receiving a personal thank-you from Musk himself.'), ('Brace yourselves for the $TSLA crash :(', 'Brace yourselves for the $TSLA crash :('), ('Jim Cramer Kiss of DEATH on $TSLA 💣💥 📉!!!

Macro Economic indicators**:\n\nFirst, let’s start by saying that the macro picture is not looking good.\n\n**A. PMI:**\n\nFlash US PMI Composite Output Index registered 47.5 in July, down notably from 52.3 in June, to signal a solid contraction in private sector output. The rate of decline was the sharpest since the initial stages of the pandemic in May 2020, as both manufacturers and service providers reported subdued demand conditions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lixfejanbgd91.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a73b97a69767e3104933250b492ef4a1bf896120\n\n**B. Philly Fed New Orders:**\n\nPhiladelphia Fed Manufacturing Index is based on The Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers in the Third Federal Reserve District. Participants report the direction of change in overall business activity and the various measures of activity at their plants: employment, working hours, new and unfilled orders, shipments, inventories, delivery times, prices paid, and prices received.\n\nPhiladelphia Fed said Thursday [its gauge of regional business activity](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/regional-economic-analysis/manufacturing-business-outlook-survey) dropped to negative 12.3 in July from negative 3.3 in the prior month.\n\nEconomists polled by the Wall Street Journal expected a 1.6 reading.\n\nAny reading below zero indicates deteriorating conditions in the manufacturing sector. This is the second straight month in contraction territory.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bd2pp4bqbgd91.png?width=772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7409ed29e70c2ff987955877777902e535cc2aa9\n\n**C. Dr. Copper**:\n\nCopper (The commodity) predicts turning points in global economic cycles. The reason for that is because Copper is used in almost every sector. Demand for Copper is a reliable leading indicator of economic health. How do you gauge the demand? By looking at the price of Copper. Rising Copper prices indicate that demand for the commodity is strong, hence, a growing global economy. A decline in prices suggests the opposite. Copper had fallen into a bear market in the run-up to each of the last four recessions dating back to 1990, as the chart below shows.\xa0Copper fell into a bear market from its peak (-24%) in May 2021.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gslpb4itbgd91.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=332b48c7d5150d3504e0b3d21e5f813338973720\n\n **D. Inverted Yield Curve** \n\nThe yield curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with a recession following between six and 24 months, according to a 2018 report by researchers at the San Francisco Fed. And yes, the yield curve is inverted. \n\n **3. Federal Reserve Rate hikes, inflation, and expectations:**\n\nCurrently, it seems like the Fed will stick to a 75 bps rate hike in July. In June inflation print was 9.1%, hitting 40 year high. Expectations were that the Fed would become more aggressive and hike rates by 100 bps (1%). Hawkish Fed members are supporting a 75 bps hike and not 100 bps.\n\n **4. GDP Release:**\n\nGross Domestic Product will be released Thursday, July 28, 2022. Economists were expecting the U.S. economy to fall into recession somewhere in 2023. On July 1st, the Atlanta Fed GDP tracker showed that the U.S. economy might already be in a recession. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow gauge sees the second quarter at a negative 2.1%. Coupled with the first quarter’s decline of 1.6%, that would fit the technical definition of recession."), ('The only way to be rich fast is either illegal or luck', 'The only way to be rich fast is either illegal or luckIf you bought into a basket of stocks 10-15 years ago , chances are some of those companies went bust , some made decent returns and maybe 1 or 2 made you moon shots .

Long story short, the world doesn't want China controlling global lithium supplies.](https://preview.redd.it/e41lshctesd91.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7684f6c589979e73e450687deac4d71665a9d50)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that we've had some pictures for you to look at, hopefully that convinced you to buckle up and choke down that third Adderall pill so you can focus for the next five god-damn minutes and read the rest of this so you can pass out and yarf on your own carpet one day. Take that Dad.\n\nThere’s a couple last important things to note with the charts above.\n\n1.)  Producing more lithium can’t be done with the flip of a switch. Most new facilities take a minimum of 5-7 years to be planned, approved, and start producing. Back in May, some window-licker over at Goldman Sachs wrote that he thinks the lithium market has peaked until 2025 ( [https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf) ).\n\nHere’s what just a few others had to say about that report:\n\n\\- [https://www.mining.com/benchmark-heres-what-goldman-got-wrong-about-lithium-prices/](https://www.mining.com/benchmark-heres-what-goldman-got-wrong-about-lithium-prices/)\n\n\\- [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/3-Reasons-Goldman-Sachs-Is-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/3-Reasons-Goldman-Sachs-Is-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)\n\n\\- [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/goldman-lithium-price-forecast-sparks-backlash-in-the-metals-world#xj4y7vzkg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/goldman-lithium-price-forecast-sparks-backlash-in-the-metals-world#xj4y7vzkg)\n\n\\- [https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/](https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I mean Goldman’s is never wrong, right? They couldn’t possibly be releasing a report like this to sink the lithium market so they can buy more for less, right?? I mean if they thought the lithium market was going to tank for the next few years because of over-supply, they would never BUY MORE Lithium stocks right???\n\nYep, you guessed it. Straight from their most recent 13F-HR filing:\n\n[This is their Q1 filing… I wonder what their Q2 will have to say when released…](https://preview.redd.it/zwpox5ayesd91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3365cae45ac8e4ac20dab84cf2eb781d80de6c5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, while typically I try not to condone this kind of behavior, I would like to give a special shout out to Mr. Window Licker himself to thank him for giving us the buying opportunity of a lifetime on many of these lithium stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.)  Lithium producers typically sign contracts to sell their product for a set amount of time (commonly one year) for a set price throughout the contract. So, going back to that handy-dandy lithium spot pricing chart, I want you to take a gander at about when that pretty little line went parabolic (hint: I fucking marked it). For those of you who are too lazy to scroll up or if you’re just unsure and want to double check your work: August 2nd, 2021. Hmm, that's about a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do we do with this information? We buy companies that produce lithium of course and we bet an unreasonable amount of our portfolio on it to boot. Now to the part all you shit-flingers will probably skip down to: “Just tell me what to buy already!” Here’s a brief summary on my lithium plays and my positions.\n\n   \n \n\n\\- Albemarle ($ALB) – 50 Shares, two 8/19 $250C, one 8/19 $260C\n\no Earnings Call: 8/3 After Hours\n\no One of the world’s current largest lithium producers than has multiple lithium mines in production and several others projects on the way. They absolutely destroyed their Q1 earnings report and should crush it once again for the next 3-4 quarters at a minimum as profits from those beautiful new lithium contracts from last year start to roll in. They are also diversified (hard word, I know) and are involved in several other market segments, but make no mistake this is still a lithium play at the end of the day. Additionally, they are US based so they’re going to get some of that sweet sweet low-interest government money courtesy of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM).\n\n\\- Lithium Americas – 920 Shares, fifteen 8/19 $30C, nine 11/18 $30C\n\no Earnings Call: 8/4 Pre Market\n\no Massive upside on this company as probably the most intriguing junior lithium miner right now. Sure, they haven’t made any profit yet, but that’s a pretty fucking big “yet”. They are currently in the final stages of approvals for the largest lithium mine in North America at Thacker Pass in Nevada. Once this makes it through a final court case appeal this September it will be all system go on this project and I would bet my left nut that that will be the case here. I won’t get too far into this since I have written about it before, but there are several other catalysts on the horizon and revenues are coming very very soon. My PT on this one is $150/share by the end of 2025.  Massive upside here, don’t miss the boat. I’ll likely be turning some of my earnings play profits into many more 11/18 &amp; 2/17 calls.\n\n\\- Livent ($LTHM) – 300 Shares, two 8/19 $25c, thirty 8/19 $30C, five 8/19 $40C\n\no Earnings Call: 8/2 After Hours\n\no Another US based company with projects that are already producing. Major earnings beat in their last call and I fully expect them to blow it out of the water once again and for the next several quarters. They are heavily focused on being as green and sustainable as possible, which is an important factor in this field. I think we could see $40/share by early next year.\n\n\\- Sociedad Quimica y Minera ($SQM) – 50 Shares (No options…yet)\n\no Earnings Call: 8/17 After Hours\n\no More similar to Albemarle since they are well-diversified, but at the end of the day their lithium production is one of their biggest revenue drivers. I’ll probably write an article on them prior to their earnings so, I’ll just say I have option plays to come on this one as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Do you know someone who drives a car? Well odds are, At least one of their next two cars will probably be electric. Electric cars need lithium for their batteries. Buy lithium producers and own your own god-damn horse track.

Here is why I’m bullish this week.\n\n**Earnings for Multiple Large Companies**     \nI believe that most of these companies will report better than expected. There will definitely be shorts on a few of them, but I do not believe it will be enough across the board to weigh down into a sell off motion.\n\n**Rate Hike - FOMC Meeting this Wednesday at 2:00pm est**    \nMany are expecting us to be surprised by 100 basis points, instead of the expected 75. I believe the 9.1% reported from June CPI YoY was expected (perhaps the anticipated peak ‘priced in’ comment from the Feds.) This means that the Fed keeping true to 75 basis points, and not 100 would be bullish in terms of them remaining confident to the plan based on July numbers compared to June.\n\n**GDP for 2nd Quarter is set to Release this Thursday at 8:30am est**    \nThis one is interesting because 9 of the 22 industry groups led to the Q1 decline. This means we may be holding our head just above water for Q2, where 2 quarters of decline would signal a recession. However, based on the expectation of Q2, similar to the outdated June CPI, we may see that the current YTD GDP position is bullish for the next 2 quarters.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe may see some crazy volatility and reaction. My prediction remains the same. This week will be bullish.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPosition.

Of course it was pretty wild to think that this was just gonna rip. Unfortunately I think I severely underestimated the bulls today… they didn’t let the market drop on FOMC like I expected. I don’t know if its cause of the bigger run up we had intraday before FOMC or what the reason was. But I expected at least a 0.5 to 1% drop with 392 being my target. We never even dropped 0.3% below $395 before she rocketed… candles double bottomed off 395.47 and then it was gone from there. \n\nMy plan was to execute a trade at 235pm and get into it. I missed my entry and watched my premium rocket. I was not going to chase it so I sat this one out. Thankfully a lot of people in the server really profited today off this trade and this entry time. I guess I was still in vacation mode and missed my opportunity. With the capital I planned to risk… it had to be perfect for me to want to enter it and it just wasn’t 100% what I expected or wanted so I sat it out. It was not very fun watch it go by and sleeping on the entry though. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zf1pqcgfg6e91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc6d5e5520490af6bf3d487f35035c0d227fb646\n\nThis FOMC had a few interesting things about it though… \n\nFirst off it was the first FOMC that we didn’t have a red week leading up to it. As you can see below the average drop this year for FOMC (not including January) was 1.2% and we barely dropped 0.3%. The new average is 0.98% drop… we dropped about 25% of what was expected. We also only rallied 1.9% from 230pm to EOD high. This was about 67% of the expected rally and about 73% of the new average rally. The other weird thing was the volume the Average volume for the FOMCs this year (including January) is 141mil for the day we barely broke 80 mil today. \n\n*Processing img o689d80gg6e91...*\n\nSo where are we? Okay a couple things we need to keep in mind from this meeting and for tomorrow… we now have 8 weeks till the next FOMC meeting. JPOW did say we are not CURRENTLY in a recession, however, we haven’t had the 2nd gdp number for him to say we are… they for the first time ever said “we are taking this meeting to meeting” and he said that we are still expecting some aggressive rate hikes in the future. The fed for the first time that I have heard said they are downgrading the economy… they are working off high job growth and low unemployment (when this changes we should be concerned). JPOW did confirm inflation is too high still (duh). Fed is no longer going to provide clear guidance for the future and future hikes like they have in the past. JPOW said the path to a soft landing is quickly narrowing and getting further and further away. No decision or timeline to end rate hikes or slow them. \n\nThe weirdest thing he said was “the first GDP reading is usually heavily revised…” I think this is going to come back around. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0ttg6mgg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d320d5c7a0aac4928f92f9d7c16106c86cffab8b\n\nTomorrow we get an interesting amount of economic data with that very important GDP. Forecast is 0.3% and we are expecting per the Atlanta feds GDP now forecast -1.2% as of yesterday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vlbxoc6hg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea4cf8cf6ac318f74e3e2899aca0f8e9215d178a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u5q5c2phg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25e7d2b4bc7255e925df291a3b37bc24d9fb01ec\n\nSO as you can see on the SPY daily we had a pretty major break through of 3 different daily resistance lines today. We also closed over the JPM morgan collars top. The last time we were at the JPM morgan collar we rejected it. This will be interesting to watch play out. The current trajectory we are on could have us resting the orange channel resistance of 411 by August 5th. If we break through that we are actually looking at a possibility of testing the overall bear market channel resistance of 433 by August 18th. If we were to break that green channel resistance at the top this month… it would confirm bear market is 100% over. That would make a higher high for the first time since January. \n\nWe FINALLY gap filled 401.44 today after trying for the last 1.5 months to fill it. \n\nWe are at a pretty important time here on SPY… I fully expect a red open tomorrow due to GDP and due to post FOMCs almost always being red. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w8tdvq8ig6e91.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1662d7d80e07ab97a889e40905aaffcf32096d2b\n\nThe last two FOMC days we have see -3%+ red days and had red opens. With GDP tomorrow it’s the perfect storm for a nice red day to not only play puts overnight but to find a call loading opportunity. \n\nOverall I am going to be looking for a call buying opportunity around 394.5 (-1.7%) support test tomorrow. If we break through that support this breaks the upwards trajectory and we could be looking for a restest of 390.9 (-2.6%) support test. I suspect this 390.9 support to hold but if that fails then we start thinking about the 378 gap. Market is in such perma bull mode right now its hard to believe we break back down to 378 gap fill right now. \n\nBulls are going to look to break through and close over 401.5 resistance and will now be targeting close over the daily 100ema of 407 (1.5%) tomorrow. From there we just slowly start picking away and resistance line after resistance line. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7amsdqig6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de67c99e6ace034fd5ef69a9a35a6f36e7f72f93\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppuzwcdjg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ec19247eb151b27b925030e64e797e734e6607a\n\nFutures painting a fairly similar picture… broke some impressive resistance lines today and held support line nicely this morning/ overnight. Overall I will be watching futures more closely as it has been the guide to where we are going next. \n\nFutures bulls are going to target holding support of 4003 (-0.5%) and then 3960 (-1.5%) tomorrow. Holding 3960 is crucial for bulls tomorrow. Bulls will be looking to break above the daily 100ema at 4080 (1.5%). From there bulls are targeting that orange channel resistance at 4123 (2.6%)  by August 5th. The biggest fight and resistance will take place at 4180 (3.9%) if bulls make it there. \n\nBears goal tomorrow is to break through that 3960 support line. From there we start back testing supports at 3920 (-2.5%). 3920 is a major support that bulls can not give up. From there we starts looking at further supports such as 3828 (-4.8%) and 3785 (-6%).\n\nAm I bullish or am I bearish? Well this ones a tough one. FOMC is the wildcard that moves markets more then it should. I don’t believe a 2.6% green day was very warranted today personally. So my expectation is that we do see a pretty large retrace tomorrow. Also statistically/ historical data speaking we should see a red day (most likely very large) after a FOMC meeting. With GDPs potential 2nd reading coming out tomorrow I suspect that markets are going to be down pre market and at 830 when that news drops (especially with a spike in jobless claims) we will see a very red day. The risk to reward of puts overnight is very high in my opinion and well worth the position. \n\nNow if tomorrow opens green and we hold green/ close green tomorrow im going to be going full bull here until the market says otherwise. Pretty much the last two weeks now dips have been buying opportunities. GDP is pretty much bears last chance tomorrow to scare the market into a dump. It will be interesting to see what happens. It also worries me how the two trading days before today were both the lowest volume of the year and today was the lowest volume FOMC day this year (about 60% of normal average fomc volume). \n\nThere is an argument that markets are waiting for GDP tomorrow before they full send it bullishly. Depending on how tomorrow plays out I will be looking at some 30dte calls for an expectation that we reach 430 by the end of August. If I don’t position long (safer not to) I will at least intraday be bullish and trust run ups more than I have before. \n\nOverall it’s a very weird market right now when you factor in volume and realistically all the terrible news and bearish catalysts we have… despite all that we are either truly having the worlds greatest bear market rally or we are seeing the bottom truly be in. Apple is about $1 (at close) from breaking through MAJOR resistance. If apple breaks through $157.66 tomorrow ($158 for confirmation) then apple has officially broke its overall 2022 bear channel… and it will be the return of the bull run. As crazy as it is to say… there is a case to be made that Apple retests its ATH by end of August…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcf0feskg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea33905045f8cca4f316e51c9a7166883edb537a\n\n10% challenge- \n\nDespite having the plan for pretty much a month now of how I was going to tackle FOMC day… I blew it 100%. I did not like when I saw that the markets did not dump at least 0.5%. I was intently watching at 235pm for what it was going to do and before I could enter the entry was gone. \n\nThe other thing I really didn’t like about today was the IV. The IV never really crushed till after 3pm. We have in the past seen a pretty good IV crush from 215 to 230pm but today we saw IV stay in the 80s the whole time. It made premiums very high and with the smaller then usually move the usually 300-500% gains were not there at all. If you timed the entry perfectly most were seeing 150-200% gains. \n\nI did a swing SPX over night to hold but took 10% and repositioned into a 4010p for tomorrow. I suspect this will pay out nicely tomorrow. If im wrong the risk to reward was good enough to warrant this play for me. Overall with no IV pump I need a 4005 open -0.4% open for breakeven. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdjsbbclg6e91.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1be80700fd2743f64d74598c5a7a7261acf2fbd'), ('puts on $META , $GOOGL (YouTube) &amp; £TikTok', "puts on $META , $GOOGL (YouTube) &amp; £TikTokU.S. Senate panel approves update of children's online privacy bill\n\nWASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee voted Wednesday to approve a measure that would raise the age children are given special online privacy protections to 16 and bar targeted advertising to children by companies like TikTok and Snapchat without consent.\n\nThe bill, which was adopted by voice vote, will now go to the full Senate for consideration.

Today I shall present what I believe to be a possibility to not only end inflation, but also make a hefty 4x profit. This is my first DD, so please be kind, but feel free to poke any holes in my thoughts.\n\nEver since the Fed [pegged the USD to Arizona](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/utjlpz/now_hear_me_out/) about two months back, I've been thinking about what the average person could do to weather the storm as inflation surges we head further into 🌈🐻 territory. And through a fever dream involving moistcritikal, Walmart, Arizona, Mountain Dew, and scallion pancakes, it came to me.\n\nSince the U.S. dollar is the World Reserve Currency, everything is tied to it, ergo, in the event of the Dollar collapsing, every other currency in the world also decreases in value. Here's where the Arizona cans come in.\n\n# Arizona fulfills all 6 requirements of Representative Currency:\n\nHistorically, money has taken many forms: beads, shells, pebbles, or even cows. However, in order to be successful, they need to fulfill the necessary requirements to make transactions as efficient as possible. I will be referencing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw&amp;t=1s), which explains several engineering principles in support of my argument.\n\n* Durability: This is a quality that shines particularly given the can's metallic nature (excuse the pun). Even though aluminum is a fairly weak metal, it is quite strong when compared to the linen-cotton cloth blend used in paper money, and does not tear nearly as easily. In addition, the can is able to withstand an incredible amount of both internal and external forces. Nitrogen added to non-carbonized drinks is pressurized to 30 psi, which is why the can is near incompressible before opening and allows for stacking. (You can stand on a can and it won't break)\n* Portability: The cylindrical shape allows for a packing factor of 91% if packed hexagonally, leaving very little empty space (as shown in the following diagram). For day-to-day use, one can hold at least two, one in each hand. \n\n[Hexagons are the bestagons](https://preview.redd.it/upy874m6sbe91.png?width=920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b0fcc689a90896c3a41b4f727495831dda85bbf)\n\n* Divisibility: A currency must be easily divisible. For example, a $100 bill USD can be exchanged for 5 $20s, 10 $10s, etc., etc. In regards to Arizona, however, this is one of the characteristics that actually surpasses the U.S. dollar, since a liquid can be divisible by any fractional requirement. \n* Uniformity: Much like paper money, Arizona shares a degree of uniformity in its designs. Each flavor has easily distinguishable packaging colors, which can easily be told apart even from a distance. The same can't be said for U.S. bills, which are all green. \n\n[Bright colors can be distinguished easily from distance.](https://preview.redd.it/4pop811psbe91.jpg?width=700&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1edd1bf154bfd5cb0d801f5718ef5a852b025b37)\n\n* Limited Supply: Haha, nice joke. \n* Acceptability: Arizona tastes great, that's an indisputable fact. And let's face it: at only 24 grams of sugar per serving, (by American standards) it's a fairly healthy drink. For comparison, it has about half the sugar of Mountain Dew, at 46 grams per serving. But wait! There's more! A typical can of Arizona has **two** servings, compared to 12oz. cans of other sodas, which only have one. I won't break down the entirety of Arizona's marketing strategy here, but there's a good reason why people think of the drink first, and state second. Getting the public to accept Arizona as a form of currency will be an easy task. \n\n# The Arizona Thesis\n\nOk OP, I hear you say. That's great and all, but you said 4x profit. How so? Here's how. \n\nIn 1980, two brothers, Nelson and William Hunt, believed that inflation would crush their investments in the commodities market, but more broadly *any investment* tied to paper currency. Using oil money bequeathed to them by their father, they began to buy up silver, as well as futures contracts. They were also able to leverage their initial cash many times over-\n\nWait wait wait. PAUSE. PAUSE. Time out. \n\nThis is the short squeeze story! OP, I can't believe you done this. You can't sHorT SquEeZe anything you want. Wrong. Well, true, yes, but in this case yes. Despite raging inflation, Chairman Don Vultaggio has said that Arizona will never, and I repeat never, surpass 99 cents. Although I wasn't able to find the exact manufacturing cost, Arizona charges retailers around 50 cents per can. I'd guess that the manufacturing cost is half that, at 25 cents. \n\nAs inflation rises, one will be able to buy *more* Arizona for *less* value, and given supply chain shortages, the more inflation rises, the faster we will be able to lock the float of available Arizona cans to sell to the public. When the dust settles on the shattered American economy, Arizona cans will become the new form of currency, and each can will hold far greater value than they were initially purchased for, by many times. Four times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObligatory Rockets:  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n**TLDR:** Forget Blockchain, buy Arizona 12-pack, wait for inevitable collapse of USD, profit."), ('AMZN Calls Before Earnings', 'AMZN Calls Before Earnings'), ('$SPY $420', '$SPY $420'), ('7-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily TA', '7-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily TAWelcome to the officially unofficial 2022 recession!

I hope I am correct and I hope that we all make a lot of money. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mtzkll2jde91.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a829c13c3e54ebeccedb6b1b3626bf3b1c599b6c\n\nOkay first off I want you to take a look at the March FOMC meetings data and todays FOMC data… kinda interesting if you ask me. We had similar days yesterday and today was identical. Now lets take a look at the Daily chart and see some interesting correlations…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gt9ppd23jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27acf0fd4e865d23478b92dedbafa0bb7fc35cd0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xopj4hn3jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0216a7ee5afd3032b32f46697d4d34ee70b5b2cc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5urcbk74jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c2ef12809a7a07c19d2687ed75761a154692302\n\nOkay take a look back at march I have highlighted with a blue arrow and a “the day before march FOMC meeting.” If you look at it there is clearly a trend there where we bottomed the day before fomc and from there if you look at the candles they are nearly identical. So what does that mean? Well it means to me we are about to go on a even bigger bull run then we are currently on. Okay hear me out here for a second…\n\nIn March we had a meeting and then we had no more meetings until May… we are currently in July and have no meeting until September. We are looking at a nearly identical trajectory and base as then. If you remember back to march it was the simple buy calls on the morning dips and let it eat. This morning I was very tempted to get into some 30dte calls and the only reason I did not get into those calls were because I knew Apple earnings were tonight and PCE was tomorrow morning. \n\nWe are in a clear bull path towards 420-430. \n\nHere is a few other things to look at and think about. If you look at the purpleish blue trend line I highlighted the May 20th to June 2nd bear market rally. That rally was about 9.69% and lasted 8 days from low to peak. I superimposed that over to current July 14th bottom. Which shows that we are now tapped out on the bullrun is that’s the trajectory we are going off. Currently from the July 14th bottom we are up 9.6%. The argument could be made that we just made the top today and it is downward from here. \n\nNow if we are basing it off the day before FOMC meeting being the bottom like March then we look at the March 14th to March 29th 11 day rally of 11.1%. Which give us an 11 day trajectory (August 10th… the day of the next CPI meeting….) and a 11.1% rally which give us about 432.8 price target. \n\nNow this is where it gets crazy…. I calculated that trajectory strictly based off of the data not the chart. Now if you go to the chart and you look at August 10th AND look at the resistance line (the solid green line) it PERFECTLY correlated at…. 433.33… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tidgke35jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e442e5dc7c303b8f19e29dc7232fdb596c80c36\n\nSo am I bullish? Hell yeah. Apple looking great after its earnings… why does that matter? Well let me show you why…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxrfhjm5jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a5208488935ad14684486cd108fb5cb64f11458\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3d2qbg46jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7745111953aa891e93b5f13070a9115775ae881b\n\nHere is the Apple chart… what do you see? You can see we are in a CLEAR downward grey channel that we have been trading within for all of 2022. This channel uses the lows from January and May then projects that to the highest point of march. IF apple opens over 157.2 tomorrow morning (which with earnings it should) then we are about to see Apple confirm 100% that its bear market is over… This would be the first time in 2022 that Apple fails to make lower highs over and over. Yes we have not broke the actual March high but breaking this channel is essentially saying the 2022 Apple bear market is now over… With this move Apple is going to Guide SPY and the rest of the market higher and higher. \n\nApples next price target assuming it holds and breaks over 157.2 at open will be 163.9 -&gt; 174 -&gt; 180.\n\nThe one thing to be careful about with Apple is if it opens up with a massive gap tomorrow whether that fills or not. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tphgasq6jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c2954f225490cd2f28c76eb06fc50da07312c49\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhlqwnk7jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842020edb718d2e0a009ad5209de891092ccd8dd\n\nHere is the SPY and ES weekly charts that show just how bullish we are… Tomororw bulls are going to look to close the week out over 4145/ 413. Breaking those weekly downward channels opens us up to those green dotted resistance lines with a price target of 430/ 4335 by the week of CPI. \n\nIf you look at the green dotted resistance and blue dotted support lines they are actually forming a massive symmetrical triangle which should lead to a fairly significant breakout or break down. \n\nOverall with not really anything negative besides PCE tomorrow… which im only even mentioning this since JPOW was so clear in his “we look at PCE more then CPI” during his speech. But after tomorrow morning when market opens and we see it settle I will be entering some either 14dte calls. I will be looking at some 14dte 414C according to optionstrat that will be about the best risk to reward for my price target of 433 and time frame. \n\nLooking at after hours right now we are up about 0.83% which will leave another nearly $3 gap on the daily down below. This would be the third on the daily chart to the downside now… does that confirm we see more downside in the future? Yes I think it does… one small gap I can justify leaving but I cant really justify leaving three pretty decently sized gaps on the daily chart. \n\nMost likely scenario is we get somewhere near that 433 price target before we reject and see further downside. 410-415 will be a crucial resistance to watch on the way up. \n\nLately it appears at least for the last two weeks that we get a fake breakout in the morning followed by a sell off and then around 10 to 11 we finally find bottom and that is the optimal buy and hold call opportunity. I will be looking for this to play out tomorrow as I do suspect we could back fill the gap down to 406.8 in the morning at open before we push higher. \n\nIt wouldn’t be unheard of to see markets open and straight rally in a trend day now that all earnings are down, gdp is apparently old news already, no fed meetings for 8 weeks and no cpi for 3 weeks. There is literally nothing to worry about now…\n\nAll dips are now call buying opportunities…\n\n10% challenge-\n\nA pretty meh day for me today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12t0x5b8jde91.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23b4d6a992ad71fc3d6b2cfaa0e88047dcae5e93\n\nI held those SPX puts overnight expecting a pretty big dump on GDP. Thankfully was able to get out of them at the bottom this morning. Apple looked hella weak this morning and with the earnings I attempted to enter for a nice free IV pump but apparently I bought the bottom.   \n I had the perfect SPX scalp around noon when there was a big dump in volume. Was up 10% instantly. Had a stop limit order in and it didn’t fill on the way down. Never saw green again. 404 was the probable high of day and it was not quite convincing at the time we would go much higher. At least we did though and I finally took my loss. Play a SPY 1dte call on the way up. \n\nSo far since I was on vacation earlier in the week and didn’t trade FOMC im sitting on a slightly red but manageable week right now. \n\nNot riding anything overnight. I was pretty close to entering those 14 or 30dte calls at market close but decided it was best to wait for apple and PCE just in case.'), ("true retardation at it's finest - bought on instinct when I should have sold CC's the plays are in the picture. purchased when everything was in the money / pre split no stops set.

I always felt that the stock market is the easiest way to make money in the long run, being a landlord is tough and running your own business caries a lot of risk obviously. \n\nWith that said, I was conflicted on how to invest. 50% of my savings went into QQQ, the rest went into Cramer covid-recovery picks. Boeing, Wynn Resorts, PayPal. All absolute garbage. Because I use full margin on all my trades, I lost like a good $30 grand on these trades. Luckily QQQ continued to be a rock and more than made up for my losses, but I was upset with myself that I coulda made more if I had just had 100% of my money in QQQ, fully leveraged and no cramer picks. Queue November 2021. \n\n**The Peak-** \n\nMy Robinhood portfolio peaked on November 8th, 2021 at $200,159.18.

Thanks to my retardedly high use of margin (and a special shoutout to TQQQ which was 50% of my portfolio) I lost **50%** of my money, about 100k. This was some terrifying stuff obviously, and I flirted with a margin call obviously.

I was now lower than I was in January, down to my last $95,000 (queue that second wave in my portfolio photo). I was made even more desperate, as my QQQ leaps had lost some IV during that month and also obviously dropped a lot in value. People were saying that QQQ might not come back up because it has a lot of crappy companies (paypal for example) and I was convinced that the next move was to buy leaps on AMD and Amazon instead. Worked great! At first. In a final breath of fresh air for my account, it once again went from 100k to 160k in the span of the last 2 weeks of March. Everything was great!

WSB won’t let me post the link. \n\nThere aren't many people, let alone investors, who wouldn't have wanted to get into Tesla (TSLA) a decade ago or even a few years ago, while market analysts and the conventional wisdom was that they'll be close to bankrupt and not be able to sell the amount of electric vehicles they are selling today.\n\nI believe that Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) is one of those candidates for 2022. There certainly are hurdles the company will face, most notably the established presence of companies like Tesla and other automobile companies, some of which have opened their first manufacturing plant over 100 years ago.\n\nBut given the fact that the company has reached a deal with Foxconn (OTCPK:FXCOF) to help with raising capital for mass production of their flagship light pickup truck the Endurance - the prospects of the company meeting their already slimmed down delivery estimates is relatively high, and thus I believe the company's potential is vast relative to its current valuation.\n\nWhat's The Deal?\n\nThe premise here is quite simple. Market experts expect the electric pickup truck market to sell around 25,000 vehicles in 2022, dominated by the likes of the Ford (F) F-150 Lightning. But by 2030, the same market analysis calls for there being a demand for about 1 million electric pickup trucks, a 40-fold increase over the span of about 8 years.\n\nMy belief is that with the help of Foxconn, as well as them focusing solely on the pickup truck model without venturing into places unknown - they'll be able to 'pick up' quite a decent market share of that 1 million vehicle demand as they ramp up production.\n\nExpectations Are Conservative, Valuation More So\n\nRight now, the company expects to deliver about 500 vehicles in 2022, significantly down from their initial expectations when announced back in June of 2021. This is a result of supply chain issues which have plagued all automobile manufacturers as a result of ports closing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts and company projections are calling for 2,500 deliveries in 2023, followed by around 10,000 in 2024.\n\nWith a starting price of $52,500 per car, which is on the conservative side since most people who are spending that much on a pickup truck are likely going to go for upgrades, as we've seen with Tesla cars and others. This brings the following revenue projections for the next 3 years, where I assume a $2,500 reduction in price each year to account for efficiency, as stated by the company:\n\nYear\tDeliveries\tUnit Cost\tExp. Revenue\n2022\t500\t$52,500\t$26.3 million\n2023\t2500\t$50,000\t$125 million\n2024\t10000\t$47,500\t$475 million\n(Source: Company expectations / Author calculations)\n\nFor the following years, assuming an ~8% market share through 2030 means that the company will have the potential to deliver just shy of 80,000 vehicles a year in 2030, which with an average price of around $50,000 comes out to about $4.5 billion in revenue per year. This is assuming the company does not launch any other vehicles throughout that time period, an assessment which I believe is silly but for the purpose of this investment thesis I will assume.\n\nBefore heading in to discuss valuation, which is the reason we're all here today, it's worth noting that these expectations and assessments are not without risk, and significant risks at that, given how crowded the electric vehicle market is.\n\nReasons To Worry\n\nThere are several reasons to worry about the prospects of success, most notably from competitive pressures like I mentioned earlier in the article from established automobile manufacturers who are already introducing new all-electric vehicles - including Ford with their F-150 Lightning which is the closest rival to the company's purposed Endurance light pickup truck.\n\nThe second reason to worry is cash. The company started off strong with around $630 million after its IPO but then has been using that cash to ramp up hiring and manufacturing plans and now only holds $204 million in cash. This can potentially be enough for them to get started as we await money coming from potential pre-orders and other investment in the company but there is a risk that they won't be able to effectively scale up production, even if demand if high.\n\nThere's a third, albeit less significant risk associated with geopolitical pressures which has been proven in the past to be important: tax credits. From administration to administration in the United States, the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles have been in and out of style and although this credit never stopped those who went for either the expensive Tesla cars or the more economical cheap versions, they do have an impact on the transition to all-electric vehicles for those contemplating a new vehicle purchase, given the higher cost. With an elimination of a $7,500 tax credit, the pickup truck categories can be hurt quite significantly, especially with the lower-cost F-150 Lightning and what's sure to be additional makes and model on the market by that point in time in 2025, 2029 or beyond.\n\nValuation Presents Immense Opportunity\n\nThe beauty of my belief in the company is that it's, for now, solely based on the Endurance sales and not on any future vehicles they may launch with or without Foxconn, which means the likelihood of them outperforming these 2030 expectations are quite high, giving us room for error if sales of the Endurance alone fall short.\n\nMost automobile companies like Ford are currently trading at around a 0.3x multiple of price to sales. I'm using price to sales multiples since it's difficult to determine what the company's profit structure will look like moving forward given the complexities of ownership with Foxconn.\n\nAlthough currently the company's price/sales ratio is high, around 4x for 2023, the exponential growth is justifying such a high valuation, given the comparative growth relative to companies like Ford. However, the company is currently trading at around 0.1x price to sales once it reaches the $4.5 billion in sales sometime before 2030.\n\nThis means that, in a conservative estimate, the company has the potential to be fairly valued at around 3x its current valuation, or around $6.00 per share.\n\nConclusion: Risky, But Worth It\n\nThere certainly are much higher risks associated with Lordstown Motors than traditional automobile companies, as well as the overall. But given that they are only now beginning to ramp up production with the new Foxconn deal, it's evident that their current price is not justified and should be trading quite a bit higher.\n\nWith a 300% potential return over the next 8 years, I believe that Lordstown Motors will easily outperform other established automobile manufacturers as well as the overall market, which is why I am highly bullish on the company's long-term prospects."), ('Lordstown Motors: Getting In Before the Surge', "Lordstown Motors: Getting In Before the Surge\nThis was posted on Seeking Alpha. WSB won’t let me post the link. \n\nThere aren't many people, let alone investors, who wouldn't have wanted to get into Tesla (TSLA) a decade ago or even a few years ago, while market analysts and the conventional wisdom was that they'll be close to bankrupt and not be able to sell the amount of electric vehicles they are selling today.\n\nI believe that Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) is one of those candidates for 2022. There certainly are hurdles the company will face, most notably the established presence of companies like Tesla and other automobile companies, some of which have opened their first manufacturing plant over 100 years ago.\n\nBut given the fact that the company has reached a deal with Foxconn (OTCPK:FXCOF) to help with raising capital for mass production of their flagship light pickup truck the Endurance - the prospects of the company meeting their already slimmed down delivery estimates is relatively high, and thus I believe the company's potential is vast relative to its current valuation.\n\nWhat's The Deal?\n\nThe premise here is quite simple. Market experts expect the electric pickup truck market to sell around 25,000 vehicles in 2022, dominated by the likes of the Ford (F) F-150 Lightning. But by 2030, the same market analysis calls for there being a demand for about 1 million electric pickup trucks, a 40-fold increase over the span of about 8 years.\n\nMy belief is that with the help of Foxconn, as well as them focusing solely on the pickup truck model without venturing into places unknown - they'll be able to 'pick up' quite a decent market share of that 1 million vehicle demand as they ramp up production.\n\nExpectations Are Conservative, Valuation More So\n\nRight now, the company expects to deliver about 500 vehicles in 2022, significantly down from their initial expectations when announced back in June of 2021. This is a result of supply chain issues which have plagued all automobile manufacturers as a result of ports closing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts and company projections are calling for 2,500 deliveries in 2023, followed by around 10,000 in 2024.\n\nWith a starting price of $52,500 per car, which is on the conservative side since most people who are spending that much on a pickup truck are likely going to go for upgrades, as we've seen with Tesla cars and others. This brings the following revenue projections for the next 3 years, where I assume a $2,500 reduction in price each year to account for efficiency, as stated by the company:\n\nYear\tDeliveries\tUnit Cost\tExp. Revenue\n2022\t500\t$52,500\t$26.3 million\n2023\t2500\t$50,000\t$125 million\n2024\t10000\t$47,500\t$475 million\n(Source: Company expectations / Author calculations)\n\nFor the following years, assuming an ~8% market share through 2030 means that the company will have the potential to deliver just shy of 80,000 vehicles a year in 2030, which with an average price of around $50,000 comes out to about $4.5 billion in revenue per year. This is assuming the company does not launch any other vehicles throughout that time period, an assessment which I believe is silly but for the purpose of this investment thesis I will assume.\n\nBefore heading in to discuss valuation, which is the reason we're all here today, it's worth noting that these expectations and assessments are not without risk, and significant risks at that, given how crowded the electric vehicle market is.\n\nReasons To Worry\n\nThere are several reasons to worry about the prospects of success, most notably from competitive pressures like I mentioned earlier in the article from established automobile manufacturers who are already introducing new all-electric vehicles - including Ford with their F-150 Lightning which is the closest rival to the company's purposed Endurance light pickup truck.\n\nThe second reason to worry is cash. The company started off strong with around $630 million after its IPO but then has been using that cash to ramp up hiring and manufacturing plans and now only holds $204 million in cash. This can potentially be enough for them to get started as we await money coming from potential pre-orders and other investment in the company but there is a risk that they won't be able to effectively scale up production, even if demand if high.\n\nThere's a third, albeit less significant risk associated with geopolitical pressures which has been proven in the past to be important: tax credits.

Currently we are visiting that 405.3 to 417.2 levels. If you look at May 27th to June 8th it appears we could be preparing to enter a similar level of consolidation. This consolidation could lead to the next leg down or up with 405 and 417 being those key levels to watch for direction. \n\nThe 417 level is going to be protected heavily by the daily 200ema and that will be quite the resistance for bulls to break and hold over, while by time we get to it the daily 8ema will be closer to that 405 level and also will add some downside support/ protection and the daily 100ema at 407.5 should provide some heavier support also. \n\nOverall daily chart wise I will be watching for range/ consolidation and prepared to play the level to level chop like I did today. Until we see the daily 100ema or daily 200ema break I am not apt to chose an overall direction. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/twterangw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9786a3823c46ab0759908677e68f0a09ede7016\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pgdenighw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e27e2430efb5a070061104a2947db0521933145a\n\nSPY/ ES weekly you can see we did break out of the bear channel, however, historically about the time w break the channel is about the time we are seeing the top and start our week of consolidation. So that is something to bear in mind. Overall the SPY 415 and ES 4160 levels are going to be very key resistance levels to watch this week. If we see a pretty clean rejection there going into next week (much like the week of May 31st and June 6th) I will be apt to play some downside going into next week. \n\nBulls need to defend the now 8 week long bull channel support at SPY 400 and ES 4018. Overall this support is also the weekly 8emas for both. An intraweek support bounce here and pushing further up before end of the week would be bullish going into next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1x97im2iw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23aca5365443d9fac728e1f719253ec938d65206\n\nOverall Apple is the most bearish of them all and as I alerted today at the 163.59 HOD rejection that Apple is the best put play between SPY and Apple. That rejection today locked in my opinion an extremely bearish week ahead for Apple. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93yf23niw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b006f87c503fad3a288e27ffe30ead4b52d775\n\nTodays daily candle is a double top and it is also a large gravestone doji. This candle should be the reversal/ downside indication many need to go long on some puts for the gap fill. As I mentioned last week apple had one of the largest gaps in many years left of the daily. I was also mentioning the weekly and how it was looking for a weekly channel rejection… well today we got that confirmed rejection. \n\nI will be looking for apple to back test support and gap fill this week. \n\nKey supports will be the weekly bull channel support/ daily 8ema at 157. And the gap just so happens to be at 157.64… almost too perfect of a bounce area. Level and daily channel support comes in around that 157 level also. I would be surprised to not see some 8/5 or 8/12 ATM puts print nicely on this gap fill. \n\nOnce the apple gap fills I do suspect there to be a nice bounce unless it flies through 157 and see 155 level. A break of the 155 level would be a bear omen and could lead to the next market sell off.\n\nIn my opinion this whole year apple has led and predicted the direction of where SPY and the markets were going. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\nI had an extremely frustrating week last week and spent a lot of the weekend reflecting and back testing a few different strategies to improve my trading. This week I decided to make a few adjustments to my trading and indicators and here they are.\n\n\\- i am now watching the 1min/ 5min chart with heikin ashi candles with a 20/ 50 ema following it. Intraday today the 1min HA candles with the 20/50ema was the best and most responsive. The 5min with the 20/50ema was great but a very lagging indicator. \n\n\\- i am no longer tracking the VIX live for entries. I used to heavily track the VIX and momentum there to confirm the direction of SPY. With the low VIX and overall detachedness of VIX/ SPY I no longer feel the need to do so. \n\n\\-I have no added my daily and weekly levels to my 15min chart I watch all day (level highlighted with purple and red thick lines). I think often times I was getting too lost in the noise of the the 15min candles, especially on days like today, and mixing the bigger picture level to level moves. Overall this was highly successful. \n\n\\-focusing on limiting entries for better profits on less entries. Less is more. \n\n\\-cutting all losers hard stop at 20%. No more letting losers become massive losers. \n\n\\-Relying on the probable and improbable IV levels as a better guide of when to and note to enter. The higher and closer to the improbable HOD the less likely hood I am to enter unless we have hella strong momentum and volume. \n\nOverall today was a great day… had one L on a bad fake out reversal that had I held woulda been very profitable but I was happy to cut the L and still turn in a profit for the day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8v2j6pujw5f91.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7042a625f4e04a5353558bfe7d06c3984dd855\n\nBiggest lesson of the day? Sometimes its better to just stop after 1 or 2 trades… had I just stopped after my first two trades and I even had talked about it in my server I would have finished with about 3x the profits I finished with today. \n\nEvery position we should be weighing risk to reward but we can not be scared to enter just to protect or win rate either. Day trading is a massive struggle of risk and reward. Some days the risk outweighs the reward but today it did not.'), ('Bear market has been canceled?', 'Bear market has been canceled?Individual Investors Ramp Up Bets on [\\#TechStocks](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TechStocks?src=hashtag_click) Shares of [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$GOOG](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GOOG&amp;src=cashtag_click), [$META](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24META&amp;src=cashtag_click) and others have suffered double-digit declines, but believers say they expect a rebound.\n\nOr this is the largest bull trap ever?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8mpizrx1y5f91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1b4f7aa7f5e45986f006a34f7125341e6ca8591'), ('TSLA Investor, new to wallstreet', "TSLA Investor, new to wallstreetI worked for Tesla since the beginning. \n\nI don't work there now but have a considerable amount of stock in the company.

These are my thoughts only, and not extensive DD...not much science, lots of intuition and anecdotal perspectives. I wanted to post here for you to challenge and see what others might think.\n\nMeta's main business is advertisement - and these ads are not selling nearly as well as they used to. With Apple's significant changes to iOS and Safari, this cripples advertisers ability to target users as well as before. This is resulting in fewer ads being sold as advertisers are moving to other channels and overall putting less value into FB/IG ads.Some anecdotal evidence that might be the tip of the iceberg for Meta ads business continuing to decline. Amex just put up an offer for advertisers to spend $350 and get $150 back. That's over 40% off! Almost always, these offers are funded by the actual company, not Amex - and Amex in fact sometimes charge the company to show these offers to their members. So we're likely looking at a \\~10% fee that brings up the total cost to \\~50% to Meta.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1vyc4v7cakf91.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3054a67a2c9f9f69e113a940b17904a781a9f49f\n\nSo if Meta is trying to buy revenue at 50% margin, that's pretty bad.Meta doesn't have that great margin already, and has been on a serious decline, down below 25% in the latest quarter. A year ago, it was 35% - that's a 28% drop in one year.

IG is still holding strong but I can see this declining as more and more influencers (and users) use TikTok instead of IG.

This is one of the most imbalanced and “unexpected” moves I have ever seen on apple. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vy6xbs3k8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9992b6c6a9028c8553f9205388de4e07d540a8b7\n\nThis was the greenest close apple has had since May 27th. As you can see looking very interesting on the daily… \n\nWe have officially broke out of the red rising wedge. We are now working on another black dotted rising wedge. This one uses early June dates for the resistance line. Today Apple perfectly hit that. It uses the last 7 trading days support for the support line. \n\nThis pattern gives a high of 167.6 and a low of 162.9. We still have that gap down below also on Apple but we are obviously getting further and further away form that gap. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tus6p2pk8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=200c1bda0bb87c211cf2e9ecec02b9dc8d81e5e5\n\nApple weekly chart broke its resistance line today too for the overall down trend and now all that is left is the resistance of the overall market which uses January 3rd and March 28th weekly highs as resistance. That gives us a possible upside of 174.5 next week. \n\nOverall if this extreme bullish momentum keeps up there is a case to be made for apple 175 next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/euqavk8l8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a06be3d1bd7d4916f02809ca8329af7ad4a5d18\n\nOverall SPY and Futures are putting in some crazy looking rising wedges… some of the tallest and most extreme rising wedges I have seen in a while on the daily. \n\nCurrently you can see on SPY we have the purple dotted resistance line which we rejected perfectly today. It uses the July 29th and June 28th daily candles for resistance. Resistance for tomorrow will be at 416.7\n\nThe black dotted resistance line uses July 29th, July 8th, July 7th and June 29th for resistance. This give sus a resistance of 418.8 tomorrow. \n\nAnd then we have the red dotted resistance line from June 28th, June 15th and June 13th which gives us resistance of 423.5 for tomorrow. \n\nWe have three potential rising wedges on the daily right now which is the most I have ever seen and they all give us potential to reject a resistance tomorrow. \n\nThe black dotted support line using August 3rd, Aug 2nd, July 27th and July 26th we have 413.8 as support tomorrow. \n\nWe broke the possible down trend resistance today too. \n\nWe are also about to hit the 417.4 level support which is also the daily 200ema. \n\nOverall despite pretty much every sign pointing to a sell off today AND that morning dump looking hella convincing the bears continue to be in control. There is no reason to short this until we break the 100ema. But I still hesitate to go long until we see the daily 200ema confirmed broken.\n\nIf we break that 200ema there is a decent chance we reach out for 430 next week. A good CPI could fuel an even higher bull run too. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv324lxl8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863757c0e7963f322dc6c7a70d5bb2ceb9001593\n\nFutures major resistances are the blacked dotted rising wedge at 4178, red dotted resistance at 4202 and the blue bull channel at 4241.\n\nThe 4178 level is both the daily 200ema and it is the resistance from June highs. \n\nThe biggest supports to watch for ES is 4117 and 4079 tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z44f7ggm8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2020a20b334ba1b0e2d880768f85da8ff568465a\n\nSpy on the weekly timeframe did attempt to break into the next weekly level at 415 today, however, end of day it lost that level. This has been a level that has been struggled to be breached and closed over since April. This will be a key level to watch the bulls and bears fight over. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rl0qkm1n8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9034aa07d93719cc3fcf8925c7ae0e20c227d37\n\nFutures also rejecting this level of 4160 too. This level for futures too has been pretty major resistance since April. \n\nThe bears will need to defend these 415/ 4160 level aggressively tomorrow if they have any hopes for the EOW and next week. Overall this is setting up for a break out to that 430/ 4360 levels unless we see a major sell off tomorrow and Friday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8a504xon8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54e7bd56d1dd6b2d9ca4aa2b693920e9e8ca191e\n\nThe VIX had the biggest red close since June 15th… the day of FOMC. I still struggle to short this until we see the VIX do something other than drop every single day. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a GREAT day I turned into an L by not following my own rules of course. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ytsqzdo8kf91.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c84e9c9985f21267473f7381aaf4205a4fbb85\n\nI played that morning drop pretty nicely. Got out for a 21.1% gain (of course it pretty much went straight to 100% right after… ) but got caught at what looked like a clear support break and close under 8ema only to get burnt. I didn’t manage my risk well enough and from there it was pretty much over. And then they faked me out with the head and shoulders on the 15min and break of momentum only to rip it even higher. \n\nTodays lesson… stick to your rules AND never ever fight momentum. The momentum today especially on the volumes was some of the stupidest extreme bull momentum ive seen yet. \n\nTomorrows a new day and a new chance. \n\nI am carrying some 9dte Apple 152.5 puts overnight that I do suspect by next week to at minimum break even. If we ever lose this bull momentum and we drop to gap fill as I suspect Apple needs to then they will be sitting pretty good.'), ('$Meta Analysis', '$Meta AnalysisThought I would share this Analysis on $Meta for some feedback and discussion.

Historically, this has been a terrible combination for forward corporate earnings. Incredibly talented 21-year old Wall Street fortune tellers who have never seen anything like this environment mark the next year\'s earning expectations for Apple, the biggest company in SP500, at up 5%. Earnings estimates for some other noteworthy companies look similar if not higher.\n\nIf the history rhymes, the corporate earnings are prone to suffer by at least 10-20% if the rates, dollar and oil stay at their respective current levels but no one seems to be positioned for it. And I have not even mentioned the probability of sustained periods of inflation so far if you noticed.

The company was founded in 2009 by Jack Dorsey (the twitter guy) and Jim McKelvey and launched its first platform in 2010.\n\nConsider the fact that the company\'s stock has retreated about 51% in 2022, the stock has under-performed versus the S&amp;P 500, which is down nearly 15%. Amid rising fears of a U.S. recession, one question is how resistant Square-parent Block (SQ) will be to a business downturn versus other digital payment companies.\n\n**Square Stock: Earnings Due Aug.4**\n\nhttps://earningswhispers.com/stocks/sq\n\nSquare on Jan. 31 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. The integration of Afterpay into financial segments and rise in popularity of beetcoin will lead to higher growth. \n\nIn its core business, Square stock aims to build a two-sided digital payments ecosystem, with products designed for both merchant sellers and consumer buyers. The Square Cash App helps individuals manage money, buy stocks and cryptocurrency, and more.\n\nCash App user growth and monetization is key to the outlook for SQ stock. Cash App growth soared during the coronavirus pandemic amid government economic stimulus and the rise of sex workers (digital e-girls). However, the bearish view is that Cash App growth will slow as the U.S. economy normalizes.\n\n**Square Stock: Cash App Growth Key**\n\nAt the investor day, Square said the Cash App now has 46 million monthly active users, up from 44 million at the end of 2021. Some Cash App metrics were a bright spot when Square reported March-quarter earnings. The company reported earnings, revenue, operating profit and gross payment volume that missed analyst estimates, despite lowered expectations.\n\nSquare is diversifying on the merchant side. Merchants with less than $125,000 in annual payment volume represented only 34% of Square\'s gross payment volume mix in December, down from 57% in 2016, noted a UBS report.\n\nSquare and Twitter (TWTR) had the same CEO in Dorsey. But Dorsey resigned as Twitter CEO in late 2021, ending the executive-sharing arrangement. Under Dorsey, Square embraced cryptocurrency. At RBC Capital, analyst Daniel Perlin says corn is more than a consumer acquisition tool for SQ stock. Block in 2021 said it plans to build a system for mining. In addition, Square created a new business line to help developers build financial services products focused on corn.\n\n**Square Stock: Big Bet On Buy Now, Pay Later**\n\nIn a recent note, Perlin said Block aims to build infrastructure that enables creepto-based commerce on its merchant platform.\n\n"Digital coins like bee-tea-sea remains a small and volatile contributor today, but could develop into a more cohesive strategy and financial contributor longer-term," he wrote.\n\nAnnounced Aug. 1, the Afterpay deal was originally valued at [$29 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/sq-stock-square-to-buy-afterpay-square-earnings/). With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing. Afterpay competes in the emerging "[buy now, pay later](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/buy-now-pay-later-consumer-financing-takes-on-credit-cards/)" market that encroaches on credit card networks. Apple (AAPL) has emerged as a rival to Afterpay with another being Affirm Holdings (AFRM). Some investors questioned whether Block needed to buy a company in this sector as opposed to building up its own capabilities or partnering. Competition is heating up in the buy now, pay later market. Block\'s 2022 guidance includes an expected $1 billion in Afterpay operating expenses. UBS analyst Rayna Kumar in a report said the "risk profile" of Afterpay has changed amid rising interest rates and the potential of increased regulation.\n\nSquare stock surged in 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak as investors focused on the growth of its consumer Cash App. They shrugged off worries over Square stock exposure to small businesses and restaurants that might close because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n**Square Stock: Payments Ecosystem**\n\nFor merchants, Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile devices. Its Square Capital division provides loans to sellers. While Square retains only 10% of Square Capital loans on its balance sheet, there\'s still a risk of defaults.\n\nPrior to the Covid-19 outbreak, SQ stock analysts were divided on whether Square revenue growth would reaccelerate with margin improvement following a period of elevated investments. The Square Cash App, a peer-to-peer money-transfer service, competes with PayPal\'s [Venmo](https://www.investors.com/research/paypal-stock-buy-now/), Zelle and others. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Cash App emerged as a digital alternative to traditional banks. Consumers used the Cash App\'s direct-deposit feature to receive government stimulus payments, for example. But Cash App gross profit growth slowed over the summer, analysts say, as stimulus programs expired.\n\nSquare is testing a short-term borrowing feature for Cash App users. Square offers loans of $20 to $200. Cash App users are expected to pay pack the loans in four weeks, with interest. Also, the Cash App provides a stock trading feature. Cash App offers a debit card through a deal with Marqeta.\n\nThe Square Cash app, Square Capital and Instant Deposit all contribute to the company\'s subscription and services revenue. Analysts have said that one key for Square is cross-selling more services to its existing pool of merchants.\n\nTo broaden its consumer platform, Square plans to buy Credit Karma\'s tax business for $50 million in cash. It\'s a free service for consumers.\n\n**Block Stock: Moving Upmarket To Bigger Sellers**\n\nWith roots in serving such micromerchants as food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square has moved "upmarket," targeting larger businesses.\n\nSQ stock ranks among the top 10 fintech companies. Bigger fintech companies include Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), Fiserv (FISV) and American Express (AXP).\n\nIn addition to selling credit-card readers, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks.\n\nSquare recently focused on software products that can be used across many industries, such as invoicing, payroll and marketing. It also aims to integrate its payment tools into e-commerce platforms. Block on May 18 said it has acquired privately held GoParrot, a digital ordering and marketing platform for restaurants.\n\n**Instant Deposit Speeds Up Process**\n\nThe company\'s Square Instant Deposit allows merchants to immediately receive payments instead of waiting a few days for settlement.\n\nMeanwhile, Square Card is a business prepaid debit card issued in partnership with Sutton Bank to small business owners on the Square platform.\n\nSquare on March 2 said its Utah-based industrial bank has launched services to small businesses. Called Square Financial Services, the bank will offer loans and deposit accounts.\n\nIn trying to move upmarket, Square takes on Worldpay and Global Payments (GPN). [Some fintech companies are merging](https://www.investors.com/all-categories/tss-stock-gpn-stock-merger-talks/), giving them greater scale vs. Square. The company recently sold Caviar, a food ordering and delivery service, to DoorDash for $410 million.\n\nOne key question as competition heats up is the outlook for the gross payment volume — total volume of sales in dollars generated by merchant customers — also known as GPV. It\'s a key financial metric for rivals like PayPal as well.\n\n**SQ Stock Fundamental Analysis**\n\nSquare earnings for the first quarter were 18 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 56% from the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected earnings of 20 cents a share.\n\nSquare said revenue dropped 21% to $3.96 billion, as Cash App transactions for digital cryptocurrency fell. Analysts had predicted revenue of $4.14 billion.\n\nFinancial analysts also view operating income as a key metric for SQ stock. Operating income came in at $1.29 billion, up 34%, versus estimates of $1.30 billion.\n\nGross payment volume from merchant customers rose 31% to $43.5 billion, versus estimates of $45.39 billion.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, management said: "Afterpay contributed $92 million of gross profit in the months of February and March, with $46 million of gross profit recognized in each of Cash App and Square."\n\nExcluding Afterpay, the company said "gross profit was $1.20 billion, up 25% year over year."\n\n**Block Stock Technical Analysis**\n\nAfter its disappointing initial public offering in November 2015, Square stock meandered. In June 2016, SQ stock still traded just above its initial public offering price of 9.\n\nThat soon changed. Square stock went on a big run starting in 2016. One analyst called [Square the next FANG stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/what-are-fang-stocks-faang-stocks/), joining the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet\'s Google in stature.\n\nFollowing its big run, Square stock fell more than 50% in late 2018 as many technology companies also crashed. Not many stocks roar back after a 50% correction. It takes time for them to digest gains and set up for another extended surge into new highs. SQ stock clawed back in 2019.

As far as I know, they wanted to license this product with Allergan (Abbvie). However, they pulled out of the deal, which would have required a three-digit million amount in milestone payments.\n\n\xa0\n\nNow a lot of money (from a licensing partner) would probably have to be injected to carry out the necessary further studies.\n\n\xa0\n\nAlthough the project is on hold for the time being, it shows that the DARPIN technology they have developed is attracting interest.\n\n\xa0\n\nLast but not least, a certain shareholder caught my attention:\n\n\xa0\n\n-Hansjörg Wyss with over 6%\n\n\xa0\n\nThe Swiss billionaire has made a killing in the healthcare sector with a deal with Johnson and Johnson.\n\n\xa0\n\nMy reasoning is that I can invest here with limited risk\xa0(liquidity almost guaranteed for years) in a company that is trading far below book value and has practically no capital tied up.\n\nPlease note, that they are currently beeing sued by shareholders for misleading informations of the company \n\nThe upside, on the other hand, would be that some partner licenses one of their active ingredients, or that the product with Novartis gets approved.\n\n\xa0\n\nSimilarly,\xa0Novartis has also acquired over 5% of the company.\n\n\xa0\n\nConsidering that the company costs little more on the stock market than their milestone payment, there is also an opportunity for a takeover here.\n\n\xa0\n\nAlso in terms of other competitors wanting to secure access to DARPIN technology in the event of research success with Novartis.\n\n\xa0\n\nThe Novartis CEO himself has expressed his enthusiasm for the DARPIN platform in an interview.\n\n\xa0\n\nNow I have to say that unfortunately I am not a finance professional and even less an expert in the pharmaceutical field.\n\n\xa0\n\nThis means that my assumptions and the data mentioned may be wrong or misinterpreted.

Today was even more impressively frustrating as from 11am until 1145am on SPY and from 11am until noon and 2pm until 245pm on VOLSPD the bears had locked in what we call extreme momentum. This was the first extreme bear momentum I have seen in weeks. Usually once a level of extreme momentum like this is locked in it takes a big move to get that momentum to break, however, the bulls both times broke that momentum and 180’d this. \n\nThe dips are still call buying opportunities… the MM are just getting better and better at selling these red days and trapping the bears. \n\nSo a few very interesting things to note that has changed from last night around 7pm until now… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptq8o70xwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4e4286a69147842e5d8949343ff3d95063e27bc\n\nLast night markets had price in an 87% chance of a 50bps hike for the September meeting after this mornings employment numbers the market now is nearly 50/50 whether it’s a 50bps or 75bps hike. Was that unbelievable drop pre market the market pricing it in already? Or does that still need to be priced in? Will markets not care until CPI Wednesday? So there is this too which is interesting…\n\nI took this picture last night of the expected CPI when I was making my CPI post… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zydhdxlxwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30745cfa02d835c76a22ff01aa3e31c498596d33\n\nCheck out the consensus… they actually today (at some point) lowered the expected CPI consensus by 0.2%. I find this very odd and suspicious to say the least that they lowered the expected CPI consensus so close to CPI. \n\nI have two theories on todays actions… 1. The employment numbers clearly caught the MM and markets as a whole by a big surprise… I mean this opening was more red then GDP confirming a recession and gave CPI a run for its money. I believe todays action (especially looking at things like IV rank) shows the MM had today already priced in as a bullish day. It would explain a lot of what happened intraday today. 2. The markets/ feds (whoever you think is in control) realized that with a huge employment number like this with an expected terrible CPI (forecast is 9.1%) markets are panicking. They are doing everything they can to keep this market from crashing into the abyss. \n\nThink about it whats really driving this current bear market rally? Overall after the last CPI and last FOMC markets are pretty much under the impression that the feds about to pivot in September. This is why the GDP/ recession and last CPI is being shrugged off and why you don’t hear the “panic” talk much anymore about the next rate hike, cpi, etc. etc. However, today was the first time the markets really said wow with numbers like this feds aren’t going to pivot and the rate hikes aren’t done yet. Markets are late to react (usually one day) to new like this and I believe we could see that reaction Monday and Tuesday. We have CPI on Wednesday and I think that’s going to be a big deal… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2mc6ycywzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6466782329e218a5e09fcd45571d7245ee4b7d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkg80wuywzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c91d2a367dad95368274183905eb77d9b8635d01\n\nI am still working off the impression that we are consolidating like we did from May 27th until June 8th before the CPI dump. If this is true then Monday (Tuesday at the latest) should start a pretty impressive and aggressive sell off. \n\nThis last week has also set up a pretty large symmetrical breakout/ down (red lines) triangle that will most likely play out Monday if not Tuesday at the latest. Key support is 410.3 (which breaks the overall 8 week long bull channel) and resistance is 413.9. \n\nWe are still stuck right between the daily 100ema and daily 200ema and we need to pretty much wait for one of this to hard break before we can finally see if we are going to 430 or 390s. \n\nIt is important to note that we have not put in a new high since Wednesday so we are starting a lower high trend. If we once again reject that red solid resistance line at 413.9 Monday then I would feel more confident that we are going to drop next week. \n\nKey levels to watch next week remain the 100ema at 407.5 and the 200ema at 417.4. Overall nothing is happening until one of those is broken. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/728od8hzwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b061604c029e31bee552aafa1e8365e17f4268a\n\nThe ES futures daily chart is looking similar yet a little different. I said yesterday “we are here” referring to the June 27th/ 28th candles and had we not had that ridiculous bull run at open and had we crashed down EOD like was expected we would have finished nearly identical to those days. However, we put in yet another doji on the daily. \n\nThe bulls were able to reconfirm bull channel support tho at open and still haven’t broken that 8 week long support line. \n\nWe here too are stuck between the daily 100ema at 4085 and daily 200ema at 4184.\n\nThe symmetrical triangle in play here too shows support at 4115 (which breaks bull channel) and resistance at 4158 (key resistance for the last 3 days) for Monday. \n\nFutures did finally break that extreme bull momentum support line that I mentioned I suspected would happen today since SPY broke its yesterday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hye8ee40xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=141e25ae9398701552d16d5f5147c6812d46a156\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wt5linr0xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a688fabee7021c82018d9bf1af5902cb621a27\n\nOverall the weekly SPY and ES futures charts are looking very similar. I am highlighting the May 31st weekly candle here on both SPY and ES. I am looking for a similar pattern to play out next week. This week we attempted to break out of this 415/ 4162 weekly level resistance. We tested this resistance numerous times this week, however, we failed to close over this key weekly resistance every day this week. \n\nI am also seeing that this May 31st weekly candle is the week before June CPI. Which also plays further into line of expectations that Monday and Tuesday is going to lead to a big sell off going into CPI on Wednesday. This would now be the 5th weekly candle to attempt to and fail to break this 415/4162 level. \n\nWe may open Monday red and just drill all week but I suspect Monday we test this level one more time. A rejection here should result in further downside. \n\nKey support for the now 8 week (9 week starting next week) bull channel is 409.1/ 4100. If and when that support is finally blown through I suspect a large selloff fuel by CPI. \n\nIf you read my CPI document you know I expect blood next week. Whether we get that or not? Well that’s a different story. The bulls are still beyond in control its not funny. At every possible weak breaking point they manage to muster together some unexpected strength. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t2usgf1xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc505d116a451d151fb27186fa0cad8e5091b236\n\nApples daily chart is still looking hella bullish with them too refusing to give up any of this relentless bull momentum. However, like SPY yesterday Apple broke the week long extreme bull momentum support line. That’s the first strike the next strike is going to be breaking that bull bull channel support line. \n\nNow despite the bull strength today the daily chart is still looking like we are putting in a teepee (the opposite of a v bottom) top. With the big run up, a doji and now a lower candle I suspect this COULD be the start to the top. \n\nI will be watching closely Monday for this blue support line at 159.8 and the red resistance line at 164.6. Apple has been even putting in large green days or small +/- 0.5% days for the last 8 weeks (minus maybe 2 bigger red days). Overall its going to take some pretty big news to put apple in the ground (it did open down 1.6% today which was a good start…). \n\nThe trend as you can see is Apple puts in a high then has about 2-3 days of small drops before it puts in a massive green day. If this trend continues we should see a small retrace before Tuesday is big green, however, if markets can break this trend and we break that key 159.8 blue bull support line we might finally fill that gap. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpesu332xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b1d4facffa650e00ac2f1d7a09089f16d12a379\n\nThere really isn’t a whole lot to be said about apples weekly besides this 8 week channel is hella impressive. This is actually Apples first 5 green weeks in a row since October 2021. It is also the most impressive bull run Apple has had since Covid recovery…\n\nWeekly support is 160.8 and resistance is 172. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nw96b3r2xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ef5eea1d6576506e48903ed7c5214ac9ad09634\n\nThe VIX continues to impressively unwind. This week with CPI we are either going to see the VIX finally go back to 30 or we are about to see the VIX go back to 15. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/arz6ypi3xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef806e54362b30b7481c6470dd9d1f7c27e6923c\n\nOverall this was actually a great week for me. I had a good time getting back to me taking these quick scalps. \n\nThe biggest L this week came on Wednesday when I let a put run to -73% and refused to close it at -30% when it felt like it wasn’t coming back and then not closing it at -50%. I held onto this loser WAY too long (I didn’t accept how strong the bull momentum was at the time) and that turned a GREAT week into a red week. Overall I am happy with how my week went, the play I made and my win rate. Had I cut this loser it would have changed my week from red to green. I continue at times to take losses fast enough. \n\nToday was a good day with 3 nice scalps. My only regret was that 1dte put. I took it before the mid day reversal (when momentum was at the bear extreme) I hit about 10% profits, however, my conviction based on what I saw was so high I didn’t take profits as I suspect we would see a retest of 409… as you can see how the day went that did not pan out very well for me… I was unsure whether to let this ride to Monday or not. I would need a 409 breakeven Monday in order to see green. \n\nI weighed the risk to reward on this on whether It would be better to salvage this and use the money Monday or whether I thought we would open and drill right to 409 to make it worth holding. In the end I chose to mitigate the loss. This was another good lesson for me that no matter how strong my conviction is and no matter what im seeing and how good it looks and how strongly everyone else also sees what I see… always protect profits. \n\nIn the end I had a great week and felt like myself again this week for the first time in a while. I look forward to next week. \n\nRemember to always have a plan, protect profits, and never get greedy. This market is chewing up and spitting anyone out who remotely get greedy or who thinks they are smarter than the MM is. Overall, protect your profits and protect your portfolio… there are better times ahead of us. \n\nHave a great weekend guys!\n\nNote- I will have a youtube video up tomorrow at some point… DM me if youd like a link as a I do not wanna get banned here but I know a lot of you have been asking about it.'), ('So I YOLOED profits from SPY puts into Luckin Coffee, not sure when to take profits.

For CPIs on a non spy 0DTE expiration day a 1DTE expiration is assumed to be used. Straddles are the closest ATM strike and strangles using 5 strikes otm both ways. \n\nOkay what did I learn? \n\nI learned that had you even played CPI in January, February, March or April the risk to reward was pretty trash. I attribute this mostly to the VIX… I didn’t include the data here but most of those you opened pretty much breakeven and then within the first 5minutes you woulda lost 50-75% of whatever you played. \n\nBased off the options movement the open on all of these were still breakeven though but for some of them you held even 30 second and you had a loser on your hands. \n\nIn June and July a straddle would paid nicely. However, Junes CPI paid out 2-5x depending on what you held and bought. The reason for this is that in June the VIX closed at 26.08 and hit its peak of 29.63 the morning of CPI (13.6%+), however in July VIX closed at 27.28 and peaked at 29.06 (6.5%+). Comparing June to July the VIX moved about 50%. \n\nNow the interesting thing is that the vix is now around 21 currently so we can assume we will be probably closer to 25 (depending on Mondays/ Tuesdays movements). \n\nThe question you have to ask yourself going into CPI this week is do you think the vix is going to react or not? If the VIX does react like June then we are looking at a nice payout. However, if we think the media is going to cover this like last CPI or last GDP then its best to sit this one out. \n\nIf you must play and you expect it to be a big movement like June with the VIX spiking too then we should be playing 10 strikes OTM for the best reward. However, if we expect a decent move but do not expect the VIX to spike like June then we should play ATM. \n\nWhat would I recommend here? I would recommend not playing anything unless you absolutely feel 100% confident that you are correct. If you are wrong you better bail immediately at open like the first second it opens. \n\nI would hesitate to play any position size that isn’t a small lotto. \n\nThis CPI is going to be a big wildcard. I believe this is the first time this year that the consensus has been lower then the forecast let alone 0.4% lower (if they don’t update it again Monday or Tuesday). If CPI comes in at 8.7% this might be the catalyst markets need to rally over 430 this week and break outta the bear market. However, IF CPI comes in trash (my best) then we have to worry about what happened Friday with jobs and last CPI where we open hella red and they still rip it green.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b8kybo0hzbg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d20bd2fdeea11080616ae993de23d27fe582e\n\nWhile I am always about going for the best risk to reward play… this is one time that I really hesitate to touch. If its like any other CPI we should see a pretty decent move intraday the Tuesday before (Read my other CPI post for details) and the day of CPI itself should be fairly impressive move. \n\nFor me as things are continuing to progress since I last wrote that other CPI post I am getting more and more worried the markets are going to pull a slick one on us like GDP, jobs and last CPI.

Do they think bottom is in. Answer is no. They do not care about bottom or top. They are just putting their money in the safe place in case of total economy collapse. In the event of huge crash US/ Canadian economy will recover the fastest. Hence the buying of bonds.\nAnd the thing about top/bottom of market is that absolutely no one can predict those things. They will happen without anyone knowing it.\nSo now what to do with the money in this market.

The following is my analysis on why I believe this run is just beginning… (The Ryan Cohen Effect)', 'I am the guy who 10X’d a $45K YOLO in BBBY. The following is my analysis on why I believe this run is just beginning… (The Ryan Cohen Effect)\n\nHey guys, if you have not seen my Yolo post, here is a shot of the position at the time ….\n\n\n\n\n\n. My inbox has been going absolutely insane, with people asking what my decision making process was and taking such a large position in a seemingly dying equity. Here is a summarization of my answer- \n\nMy Thesis on this Play is as follows - \n\n I have been monitoring the stock ever since Ryan Cohen took a position. Although, it has been on my radar since January 2021, as it was one of 13 stocks that popped in sympathy w/ GameStop, and due to the basket swap ETF that those stocks were added to, it has been consistently running in tandem with Gme ever since. However this is the only one of those companies (other than GME) that Ryan Cohen has personally taken stake in..\n\nAfter the URN - ings disaster, the stock was pummeled and plummeted from around 15 bucks to around 7$ bucks. \n\nSo Initially, I started seriously looking at it for a reversal. However, After the aforementioned meltdown and subsequent -50% day - the CEO stepped down, and the stock was pounded further down into the 4s.\n\n…Come to find out Ryan Cohen, (after acquiring 10% of the company in march) was again performing a hostile takeover, and had actually forced the overcompensated CEO out, while also being alotted three seats on the board. This is also after penning two open letters on behalf of RC Ventures, voicing his distain for the way the company had been running, it’s lack of profitability, and how it stemmed from the top down, as its corporate executives were highly overcompensated, and he proposed the sale of its spin-off company- “Buy Buy Baby”. This spinoff acquisition seems to be rolling, and a proposal of a hefty investor dividend from the proceeds has been initiated. \n\nWith GME as far and away, my primary holding, I am and have been HEAVILY invested in Ryan Cohen. As an investor, I do not invest in companies  with the conviction in which I invest in people. This theory of mine started with Steve Jobs / AAPL , back when I was 18 and the first iPhone came out, continued with Elon Musk in Tesla before they even had the first consumer vehicle on the road, and now Ryan Cohen, as he is tactically fighting to dismantle the forces on Wall Street that blatantly fuck the little guy. Not to mention the turnaround/pivot strategy in which she is just about flawlessly executing in GME. So naturally - his acquisition of equity in $BBBY caught my attention, and it soon became immediately clear that this was possibly the deepest value stock on the market. Especially considering RC’s cost basis is $15. In addition he holds millions of dollars worth of $60, $65, $70 and $80 strike call options expiring January 23.\n\nAs GME was getting ready to split, I started seriously tracking and charting $BBBY to find a clear bottom, as I had/have supreme confidence that a serious turnaround is/was just on the horizon. \n\nThat said, it does not take genius to see the DEEP value, and spot a reversal play when a stock goes from mid $30s in March to sub $5 in June - even without the Ryan Cohen‘s factor.\n\nAgain, $BBBY was one of the 13 stocks that had the buy button taken away when GameStop originally popped off in January of last year. All of those stocks are in a basket swap ETF that hedge funds use to short these stocks. The correlated movement is especially apparent when GME is in its FTD cycle - The one that has seen it consistently and predictablely pump from The bottom, to the tip top of the descending wedge in which it is currently in the process of breaking out of. But when is the next FTD cycle you ask? I’m glad you did, because it started last Friday, and runs into OPEX clearing at the end of August. \n\nSo again, these stocks move in tandem, and usually all pop one GameStop pops - or in the case of bed Bath and beyond in March when they announced a share buyback after hours in March 2022, BBBY actually acted as a catalyst for the rest of “meme basket” and bed Bath &amp; beyond, GameStop, K O S S, AMC, and the rest of the Memes all had an exact correlating after hours pop. \n\nSo back to this play - I started seriously considering taking a large position leading up to the Gme split, as I anticipated a very solid pop in GME’s stock price, and a subsequent appreciation from BBBY, as it was literally, aside from the Covid crash, at its lowest point since 1996 - almost 3 decades.\n\nI waited patiently to take the larger position, while playing the weekly five and six dollar calls, especially on Fridays, as they would usually have a VERY solid 0DTE run in that span of a few weeks. I actually hit another separate 2000% gain on a Friday, as the five dollar calls ran from .035-$.60+ - except I only had about $1000 in play at the time… either way, gains is gains, and that is when my eyes truly lit up to the probability of a massively historic opportunity here. \n\nAs things played out, $BBBY would go on to show a bullish divergence, and completely decouple from the indices. It reached 100% utilization, with several days of zero shares available to borrow on interactive brokers or FIntel.\n\nThen last week I come to find out that they had shorted over 100% of the float. That is when I decided to take this risk, and look for an serious entry.\n\n\n\n\nAfter watching it for so long, the options prices were so ridiculously manipulated that I did not want to gamble on 0DTE, even though I had major success with it prior. So I bought one week out (not 2 1/2 as stated in the original post… I was super burnt out and my brain friend when making the post. My apologies)….\n\nAnyways, I do trade for a living, and rather than compulsively day trade, I look to set up monsters like this. So I guess it was a combination of skill and luck that I timed the bottom and my entry so precisely.\n\nThe stock gapped up the next Monday morning, and kept rising all week long. If you look at the chart, you will see a pattern of a big pop in the a.m., and then a slow steady rise throughout the rest of the day, with a very bullish finish.\n\nSo yeah, I just kept holding them, and they kept appreciating in value. I did put a shitload of time and effort into setting this up, and after Tuesday I was up considerably. Enough to feel comfortable holding as the entire float was sold short.\n\nEventually word got out and the options chain started going crazy. On Thursday there was an incredibly bullish finish and follow through, and Thursday evening, $BBBY was all over WSB.\n\nThursday it closed at 6.12, and if it were to be able to close above 6.50, The entire float would be in the money via derivatives. That is a pretty intense situation considering the entire float is also sold short, as well as 100% utilized, meaning held by institutions insiders and retail.\n\nFriday morning it popped off, and just kept rising.\n\nSo yeah… I would say a combination of skill and luck, but mostly just putting my money where Ryan Cohen does.\n\nAgain, he has millions of dollars in $60- $80 call options expiring January 23, as well as a $15 cost basis. He also holds the grenade that should act as a catalyst to send $BBBY to the moon, should any type of “MOASS” like Price action go down with Gme , but once again, at the very least, his cost m basis is $15, just about double what the current price is.\n\nAs one of, if not the best investor of my generation, as well as the largest single entity shareholder in $AAPL, I think it wise to closely monitor and follow his investments.\n\nHopefully this comment gets pinned in this post. It is my hope that it can serve to answer the hundreds of inquiries I have received, questioning my decision making process around entering this trade.\n\nIn closing, if you feel like you have missed out on this opportunity, you could not be more incorrect, in my opinion. As it is my opinion (and just that, my opinion nothing else) I believe $BBBY is one of - if not the best deep value play of 2022. I wouldn’t go  as far as saying it is GameStop2.0, but it is most certainly close, and if there was ever anything even remotely close, $BBBY is certainly it.\n\nFor anyone interested in the statistics on short interest end all around holdings I would urge you to check out - w w w. byebyeshorts . c o m \n\nIn regards to the Yolo… \n\nI Chose the strikes I did because they were closest to in the money, had the best Delta, &amp; the least risk of incurring a substantial loss, should the price have had negatively fluctuated overnight. \n\nI decided to Exercise what I could because I have supreme confidence that the stock price will go much much higher. Also for tax purposes obviously. HOWEVER - I believe the $BBBY stock price will reach between 60 and $80 if not more before January 2023 here is why….\n\nMuch love everyone!

A significant caveat is that the price-to-earnings ratio has previously averaged 12.7 on a normalised basis, compared to above 20 now.\n\n# Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;Biden signs the CHIPs act in order to boost US semiconductor manufacturing and compete with China.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;UK plans for potential power cuts to industries and homes in January.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Russia's Transneft: Ukrtransnafta stops pumping Russian oil through Druzhba pipeline to Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia - RIA.\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1wrhwzwbrg91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37b344e5a66135218f5021b2d42995cbe3378c9d\n\n# 🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ravbgnybrg91.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc9d93869856c8d07ca688e26fb489b5495c0230\n\n## Where are we on the Chart?\n\nBroken record.\n\nIf we can close above 417-418 for a few days, Ill be looking for 430 ish as the next target - with eyes on the next leg up to put us around 450 - 460 around mid to late Sept.

Get ready. 8/9/22 Premarket outlook and Technical Analysis for day trading the SPY. \n\nGoodmorning traders, one day until CPI. Let’s examine what has happen technically coming into CPI. The First thing that I see is that the daily chart’s MACD has flatten out. One of my rules for swing trades is never short on a vertical MACD. Now that it has leveled out now, we may be able to start hunting for shorts. The weekly chart is still the chart in control and it is in its water break or rest area but it still seems to have a little more sideways action baked into it. Remember, when a chart hits its rest area like a runner in a marathon there is a tendency to run in place (consolidate)while it builds energy to go thru the next level or range. This Consolidation on the weekly chart could be a very large range (possible 421 down to 405). The weekly chart also feels like it is at or nearing the top of its current range. With this down move starting to play out before CPI, remember the market is a pricing model that likes to price in event ahead of time. So, we could be setting up for a sell the rumor and buy the fact which goes along with the bizarro world effect we have been in because I can’t imagine CPI being good news. Now if the weekly is the chart in control remember waiting on the turn in the weekly is like waiting on a tanker ship to make a U-turn. Knowing this we have to watch the daily and 4-hour for early signs and entries. This is all setting up for a very nice pop back up during or after the CPI report where we can start looking for swing short.\n\nKey levels to watch for ...

First thing to notice is that we started with an expected move of +/-8.825 for the week, two days have passed and today’s expected move is still over half the weekly’s expected move. This is saying we are going to have a heck of a range today (big move alert). Second, we had a gap down on internals from yesterday that we did not cover so there is still some upside risk coming into today. Technically, the weekly timeframe is the chart in control and based on that chart there appears to still be room to go up. Even though I see room to go up on the weekly it's not much which means the Room to go up could be filled by going sideways being that we are in consolidation mode or rest area for the weekly time frame. I am still not letting go of 418-421 level just yet. The Cpi Could be the boost or last gas effort to get up there. The daily chart is overbought but isn’t quite ready to fall out of bed just yet. Although it is headed down out of overbought territory it has a rest area or consolidation zone to go thru first and with the MACD still on the positive momentum and trend side it's likely we have a last-ditch effort waiting to go back to the upside before a complete breakdown. The 4-hour chart is next up in the rotation and is at the lower part of its range ready to cycle back up and retest the top of the most recent range. Now for CPI numbers, I said earlier this week it would be hard for me to imagine CPI having good news or good numbers. However, for the market to be good\xa0it need only be less than the 9.1 reading from the last CPI. Nobody ever seems to take into consideration the governments cheating by always moving the goal post. We will get a CPI number but it's not the real number because they are overlooking and taking certain things out of the latest calculations of CPI, go back and look at revisions and you will see how they keep raising numbers to be in line with Fed speak. Earlier this week I pointed out that momentum to the upside was fleeting. So, imagine a water hose spewing water and when you cut the water off it doesn't immediately stop spewing water it slows down. If you have the water hose pointed up it slows down and if you move the hose a bit it could still give you that last couple of good sprays before retreating back in the hose. This is where we are on the weekly and daily chart, down to the last one or two good sprays. \n\nKey levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)412-413, (queen)414-415 and (king)416-420 area. Support (jack)411-410(queen)409-408 and (King)407-403. The main thesis is Bearish bias closing below 411.35 projected target/low of between 411-406. Alt thesis is Bullish bias closing above 411.35 projected target/high 414-420. The numbers were showing bearish thesis however whenever more traders are on one side and we get the opposite reaction that opposite reaction will be super explosive, and that is the set up for today. The current major channel we are in 397-416 and the next major channel up is from 416-425.\xa0 Scenarios for the day: \n\n1) Trend day up we open gap up and start with a fade back toward the previous close.

We also failed to even hit the 30day volume average. Are bulls still exhausted? Is this a buying the rumor sell the news type of event? \n\nTomorrow will be pretty interesting to watch.

We rejected it perfectly today. I am surprised we did not break through this resistance today as this felt like an easy layup for the bulls to take spy to a 3% plus green day. \n\nNext major resistance I have is at 421.1 and then 423.7. \n\nOne key takeaway I have from today is that we did back test the daily 200ema and we are holding that support very well. I do favor that as a bullish omen for the markets. \n\nWe are seeing an impressive $3.97 gap on the daily though. We now have three pretty large daily gaps with two down near 370s and now this one in the 410s. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmmxq3qs7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a43305755af44e1c3c5f2c2ee2055dcd72f9e2ef\n\nSpy weekly is looking pretty bullish though. We have held the weekly 9 week long bull channel support and now we are looking to test this weekly rising wedge. Resistance for the weekly to watch is 423 and key support is now 415. \n\nIf we continue to trend like this I have little hesitation in saying that we touch the 430s next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmhj7dct7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1013900f7b2941c50e5caafcf0e0fac10b7c22d8\n\nES futures is in the same boat. Key resistance remains at 4223 for the rising wedge and then 4275 for the next rising wedge. \n\nSupport is now at 4184 the daily 200ema followed by 4140. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkuao6yt7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4899599e98b6cb8605ca97329dd67c52d4f2f56\n\nFutures weekly never did confirm the bull support however we are not trending over that weekly resistance level of 4163. A close over that and I do suspect that we see 4300s next week. \n\nRising wedge resistance is 4232 and support is that 4163 level tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yoeyoeku7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebf8a53de06faaae4ad702c0cd8cb90ffae5cd57\n\nApples like that gold fish that no matter how neglected it is, how often you feed it, how often you don’t change the water, or how often the cat tries to eat it… that mofo just don’t quit. \n\nApple broke through the rising wedge (this is the one that spy/ es rejected today… omen for tomorrow? Most likely) and closed over the support level of 168.9. \n\nFrom here apple is on a mission to test the bear market resistance level of 173-174.5 depending on how quickly we get there. We now have two MASSIVE gaps on the Apple daily. We have a $1.86 gap from July 29th and then todays $1.08 gap. When will we fill these gaps? This week? Next week? 2023? Who knows at this point… Apple on a mission for green and I hesitate to bet against that. \n\nKey resistances- 171.8 -&gt; 172.8\n\nKey support- 168.9 -&gt; 166.5 -&gt; 164.9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95lc5i6v7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=902b4257d02803cdaf1ad71b9039f734c801f333\n\nThe VIX has just continued to go lower and lower and lower. I am a little impressed that it bounced directly off my falling wedge support line though and that it didn’t dump into the 18s today. However, the VIX is on an almost 9 week long unwind. \n\nInterestingly enough the bounce today is at the median high level that the VIX spent most of its time at in 2021. The low end is closer to 15.5. If we continue to see the VIX unwind we are going to be looking at a new possible range of 15.5 to 19.75. \n\nHistorically I would say most of 2022 has been spent between 18.6 and 25.5 or 25.5 and 34.7. I would even venture to say that most of 2022 has been spent well over 25.5…. Is there a reversion to mean expected here? Do we short term revert or do we long term revert? \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall today and really this week has been a great week for me. I was swinging that Apple put that I averaged down yesterday. I did attempt to close it EOD yesterday but it didn’t fill missed it by about 10 cents… I was already down over 50% at EOD yesterday. I was able to closer it at open before the IV crush for -84.3%. Overall im still at 1.5x weekly profits with that loss. \n\nI am continuing to capitalize on quick scalps using the 1min/ 5min HA candles with STOCH and VOLD/VOLSPD 1min HA candles. The 20/50emas here have been gold for me. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4rprh1w7yg91.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc5d4a6ac354ff3ab23eb5e50de0ddae975a9e8f\n\nAim small miss small. I am currently 9 for 9 on plays this week and my only red play is that swing play that I opened last week. Overall its been a great week. \n\nToday was a tough one to trade because we had such extreme bull momentum, however, the candles were moving at snail pace all day. Going to be interesting to see what tomorrow brings. \n\nOn one hand this feels like the bulls are exhausted and gives me May FOMC vibes where she dumped like a mofo the next day and on the other hand this felt like a premarket run followed by consolidation all day. EOD I saw some crazy buying coming in on VOLSPD and VOLD. Very organized and consistent buying, however, SPY barely budged and even sold off at the end… I wonder if we just saw a ton of shorts cover EOD. \n\nRemember in this market guys we don’t need to go for homeruns. We don’t need to play every single candle. A 10% win that you let turn into a -20% loser is actually a 30% loser… Be smart out here. \n\nYoutube video be up later tonight')], '2022-08-11': [('Inverse Cramer? - Jim Cramer says to pick up these four stocks if the market goes down on Friday', 'Inverse Cramer? - Jim Cramer says to pick up these four stocks if the market goes down on Friday* **CNBC’s Jim Cramer offered a list of stocks to buy on Friday if the market declines.**\n* **“I was very disappointed in the performance of the tech stocks today … That said, I think the market will let you into the best ones and you’re going to get better prices again,” the “Mad Money” host said.**\n\nIf market drops on Friday, stay away from these stocks - $DIS, $MSFT, $AMZN &amp; $AMD \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/11/cramer-pick-up-these-four-stocks-if-the-market-goes-down-on-friday.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/11/cramer-pick-up-these-four-stocks-if-the-market-goes-down-on-friday.html)'), ('$SPY $420.69!', '$SPY $420.69!'), ('BBBY 6942 Shares YOLO + AMD Gain', 'BBBY 6942 Shares YOLO + AMD Gain'), ('Disney surpassed Netflix on subscribers.

PG -10%\n2. DIS -29%\n3. QCOM -29%\n4. STZ -4.3%\n5. MS -15%\n6. JNJ -6%\n7. HAL -23%\n8. META -19%\n9. PXD -9%\n10. MRVL -32%\n\nInverse Cramer performance:\n\nThe strategy tracks the performance of companies that have been most recommended by the popular TV host over the course of the past month. It does that by opening a short position in the top-most recommended companies while hedging it with a long position in the market index. The strategy uses an equal-weighted portfolio, with an implemented system of weekly rebalancing. This approach was successful in generating a CAGR rate of 26.18% given its inception date of the 1st of January 2021. It has a one-year return of 20.13%, as compared to the S&amp;P500 which generated a negative 6.29% return.\n\n[Wait until this dead cat bounce is over...](https://preview.redd.it/cdfa9xsee6h91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97b4bd4150df69d6a97270e8849e940573c47623)"), ('WSB is powerful.

I have been trading the stock market since 1990. I was one of the original soes traders they called us back then. Pre Algos, so it was you trading between humans and whoever the better man was, made a lot of money. We would routinely beat up on the big boys, when I say big boys I mean market makers and hedge funds ( we are the little guys, retail traders) Goldman Sachs especially hated us because all of their highly paid traders would take a beating from us, until they changed all the rules in their favor and then algos came along.( robbing the little guy is what they do best) It seems some people in this sub are a-lot younger than me and might not have experienced asset bubbles, basically it’s assets getting way overpriced and irrational and when the bubble burst guess who gets stuck holding the bag? The retail trader of course. I have experienced 3 bubbles bursting in my life, the dot com era, the housing crisis and now this year starting in January 2022. When bubbles Burst the stock market does not go down 20% into bear market territory and then rally to new highs. This is the main reason why I’m posting this, I don’t want whoever learns from this to get hurt by the big boys. When bubbles burst,  the stock market goes down 50% or more, not 20% and rally. What you are seeing in the stock market since June is a major manipulation with algos trying to suck in retail traders and train them to buy the dip just like they did on the last sell off. They need retail to provide liquidity for when they come back from their vacations( just check the daily volume on spy, it is almost 50% less of the average monthly volume) the big boys all turn off their machines in mid may and turn them back on in sept. You will notice the volume spike. What I’m trying to relay to the retail( little guys) is to be prepared for a major sell off in all assets, stocks, cryp, nfts, homes starting in September. The Market will probably run up until then, trying to suck the little guy into buying the dip and thinking we are going to make new highs. The next stop on the down side is S&amp;P 500- 3200-3400 range, probably will end the year in that range.

Overall made out decently for a short trading day for me today cause of the kiddos. \n\nBig red open today…. Turned into a decently green day for SPY.\n\nSo what did we learn? Anything? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qdlxcntnzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb40df51ffba6704eb44025b19b2fffe35d42154\n\nOn the SPY daily we had that massively tight and aggressive black dotted rising wedge form last week. Well today we saw SPY poke its head over that black dotted resistance line. We also perfectly rejected the 429.4 daily resistance level (that’s the yellowish tan horizontal channel). \n\nWe also saw the support line of that pretty aggressive black dotted bull support line reconfirmed today at open. \n\nOverall tomorrow or Wednesday is shaping up to be the “D-Day” where we are finally going to reachout and touch that solid green bear market resistance line. Tomorrow if we get a bullish enough day we are going to test not only the black solid rising wedge resistance but we are also going to test the green solid bear market resistance line at the same time. Could be a very big make or break type of day with it only being 0.6% away from close today. \n\nMajor resistances tomorrow- \n\n439.3 (daily level resistance) -&gt; 431.8 (bear market resistance and black solid rising wedge resistance)\n\nMajor support tomorrow-\n\n427.2 (black dotted support line) -&gt; 424.8 -&gt; 423 -&gt; 421.4 (red solid bull support line)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y80vmsnozxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95ad6d2814378f99f1b697fb3bc36feb8e0a55f9\n\nFutures is looking pretty similar we see that red solid resistance line broken just barely EOD today and we are holding close to that green solid line. \n\nResistance-\n\n4317 -&gt; 4335 (bear market resistance) \n\nSupport-\n\n4296 (blue solid support line) -&gt; 4252 -&gt; 4210 (daily 8ema)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4umsbspzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c4fee89dea5d6c4bd33a03f19c5391f114ed3d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxh3vw9pzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb08c9aa832bdcc52b60becbb80b034e501cdda6\n\nOverall SPY and ES futures weeklies are looking pretty similar. \n\nResistance- \n\n432.5/ 4340 (dotted rising wedge resistance, SPY weekly level resistance, and bear market green resistance)\n\nSupport-\n\n420/ 4190\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lm0bglhqzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bf90f67772fa1fedb7b7dae676f861dc4799ec3\n\nApple is absolutely still a madman running like a chicken with its head cut off. \n\nResistance-\n\n174 -&gt; 174.6 (black solid rising wedge/ bear market resistance) \n\nSupport-\n\n173.1 (black extreme rising wedge support) -&gt; 172.1 -&gt; 171\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0e7etn2rzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b9f6b1c912bc471675ce51b53a9e492cf1d0686\n\nInterestingly enough the VIX bounced pretty high today. With a close at 20.34 Friday and an intraday high of 21.74 that was a pretty green open for the VIX. However, like usually throughout the day we saw the VIX slowly unwind and with that SPY go up and up. \n\nAs I mentioned last week im looking for the VIX to break that resistance line and end up somewhere near 22-24 before I assume the top is in. \n\nOverall I will be looking for Spy to touch that 431.8 (daily) bear market resistance and the 432.8 (weekly) bear market resistance lines tomorrow. A hard rejection at either one of those should be assumed as a great put opportunity. I will be watching the daily level first. If we break through it but don’t break through the weekly we can assume the next day the weekly resistance will be taken down. However, if we get stopped in our tracks at 431.8 then I am assuming for the time being we are maxing out. \n\nWith the bigger red open today and the early morning chop and weakness and the continued low volume trading I would not be surprised to see a little consolidation and back testing of support at 427.2 tomorrow and actually attempting bear market break out on Wednesday with the assistance of FOMC minutes at 2pm. FOMC minutes is usually a pretty bullish day and movement and we should suspect nothing less in this current environment we are in (TA has been posted to the server on how to trade Wednesday). \n\n10% challenge-\n\nI didn’t sit down at the computer till closer to 930am this morning cause it was the kiddos first day of school so was playing a little catch up. Overall I was fairly patient today and only made two trades before I had to leave around 230pm. Short trading day for me but overall a good day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lejru4srzxh91.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d9743f1e9553377371ce5969f579dab24c38012\n\nI know the server has been discussing this but premiums continue to move wildly abnormal. I took that put trade around 1030. I went green instantly and then red. I had my 25% stop limit set which should have triggered at 426.5ish, however, I approached there on a bounce saw about -23% then Spy fell back my direction by about 10 cents and all of a sudden I went from -23% to -10%. SPY then came back to me and I was green before my PUT hit the spot price that I entered at. I bailed pretty quickly on that just cause of the abnormal movement. It was extremely odd. \n\nMy call was just as odd today but it was a TOS issue. I bought 25 contracts and when I sold my bot only showed that 1 contract sold, however, I had the profits from all 25 selling. Even my orders for TOS showed that only one sold. It was an odd day for sure. Thankfully finished all green. \n\nDays like today though I do not enjoy trading. I didn’t wanna take calls today cause it was at extreme overbought levels pretty much from 1115 to 1pm when it finally rested. I was comfortable taking the call around 2 when SPY reconfirmed the 8ema as support on the 15minutes and we were showing oversold levels with favorable volume. \n\nThese bull days are even more intense and extreme then the 2021 bull rally was. I was comparing todays and especially Fridays movement to those of 2021 and even the really big days in 2021 (and even in early 2022) that we bullish SPY rested along the way. It would retest the 8ema and sometimes even drop a candle below it. However now we are just seeing these bullish days where the momentum goes green and it never stops and it pretty much negates every indicator out there. And the worse part about it is its not like we have extremely high volume where I can say well yeah everyones buying so it makes sense… we are just not seeing anyone sell right now is the issue. \n\nVideo will be up on youtube later!')], '2022-08-16': [('$BBBY - No BS answers to FAQ', '$BBBY - No BS answers to FAQ**Q: Should I buy?**\n\n&gt;Your money. Your decision. I don\'t care.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q: Why are people buying?**\n\n&gt;People are buying for a lot of different reasons. One big reason is that Ryan Cohen (an activist investor), has taken a large stake in the company. He believes that buybuy BABY (a holding of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond) is significantly undervalued and is not being factored into the current share price (note: he said this when BBBY was $16). I recommend you read his [letter to the Board of BBBY](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf) for more information. Bed Bath has said they\'re exploring options (e.g. a sale, spin-off, etc.) for buybuy BABY and will announce their plans sometime soon (some people have said by EOM but I can\'t find a source for this). Other people are buying because they recognize the *potential* of the options activity on the stock price, the short interest, or just pure FOMO/memes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q: How high will it go?**\n\n&gt;Nobody knows, and if they claim to know, they\'re lying. DO NOT take these dumbass price targets seriously, but to be fair, there is a non-zero chance they could ultimately play out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q: What are the risks?**\n\n&gt;The price could go down and you could lose your money. Bed Bath is also in a pretty bad financial position, so it would not surprise me if they did an offering at some point in the future to raise cash. These offerings usually kill all momentum in the short-term. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q: But Ryan Cohen has $80 calls, wouldn\'t it at least hit $80?**\n\n&gt;No. There are ways to make money on calls without it hitting the strike price. He can sell at any time and you should expect him to sell at some point. He wants to make money just like everyone else. There are factors that could cause the stock price to go higher though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q: What other factors are you talking about?**\n\n&gt;Options can be a significant driver of stock price (see AMC and GME). People think that the options activity on this stock can cause something called a gamma squeeze, which is a whole another topic in itself, and there are plenty of resources out there that explain the basic idea behind it (see below). There are also roughly 30 million shares sold short which accounts for over 40% of the free float (the figure varies by source, but I reference the [Nasdaq themselves](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bbby/short-interest)). BBBY is one of the most shorted stocks in the market (if not *the* most). If enough pressure is put on the shorts, they will likely buy back those shares (i.e. close their position) which will bring it higher. It\'s possible they\'ve already covered given the run up we\'ve seen today and the volume. We won\'t know until [next Wednesday](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Gamma Squeeze ELI18: There are people called market makers. Their job is to provide liquidity to the markets. They\'re often the ones who sell options to you and me. When they sell us an option, they need to hedge it in order to maintain something called a "delta-neutral position". Market makers hedge call options by buying the underlying stock (BBBY). The more calls that are bought, the more they need to hedge. Depending on the amount of options there are, this can sometimes cause a feedback loop of buying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q: Why did BBBY sell off today?**\n\n&gt;Again, nobody *really* knows. But there was a market-wide sell-off at the same time BBBY sold-off. You can see this in the S&amp;P500 (i.e. $SPY). I also recommend you look at what GME did before it made its final run in Jan 2021 (spoiler: sold off over 50% from the intraday peak, which is much worse than what we saw today).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q: I\'m interested in initiating a position, but don\'t know where to start.**\n\n&gt;Buying shares is always the safest bet because they don\'t expire (you can baghold them until you die). I do not recommend you play options unless you know what you\'re doing or are regarded enough to accept the risk. Take into account that people have bought BBBY at $5 and are up over 400%, and even more if they bought options. It seems like you\'re a little late but you could still be very early. People bought GME at $5 too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Q: I bought, what now?**\n\n&gt;You can do whatever you want. If it reaches a price you\'re comfortable selling at, sell. If you want to wait for Bed Bath to announce their plans with buybuy BABY, then wait. There\'s no right answer. Know that it will be volatile and you will not time the top or bottom. The price will go crazy and the "technicals" might be screaming at you to sell only for it to rip to new highs after you do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck all.'), ('The way BBBY opened on market today shows great potential for the stock booming today 💎💎💎', "The way BBBY opened on market today shows great potential for the stock booming today 💎💎💎Surrounding all the hype around Bed Bath and Beyond (and indeed, any stock here), there's three types of analysis of the stock out there:\n\n1. The pseudo-intellectual analysis of the fundamentals of the stock\n\nThis is your typical DD. I think this comes from a good place, albeit misguided, as most news has already been priced in. Many people compare BBBY to GME, but one crucial difference is that the hedgies we're trying so hard to destroy are partially on our team as well, playing both sides (hedging their bets, perchance?) to profit either way and as such, news like execs buying stock has most likely been priced in already.\n\n2. Even more pseudo-intellectual analysis of technical and candle charts\n\nIf I'll be honest, I'm not crazy about this kind of stuff. I could draw random polygons all day that tell you the stock's about to moon to 3 billion or about to plummet to negative 7 Jupitrons. Candle charts are also very subjective, with the same candles you can say oh that's 3 white soldiers it's about to moon, oh that's about to form a shooting star it's about to fall. And indeed, if candles and technical analysis really could make money reliably, everyone and their grandmother could just write a basic program that identifies patterns and buys and sells, making everyone a bananacoin billionaire. Very weak tea indeed.\n\n3. Pure, cold hard mathematics proving reasoning for price points\n\nThis will be what this DD attempts to be. I understand that since I personally have invested in this stock, I'll be a bit biased towards the stock, but I'll try to argue both sides and reason why, me personally, I belive this stock will go up based on it's closing price yesterday and the changes in the open.\n\n[Taken 4 minutes after stock market open](https://preview.redd.it/jgc6n5qnz2i91.jpg?width=1241&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3894c5e0a2ea95460c22c10fd63b7a15923dcf1)\n\nAt 4 minutes into the trading day, $BBBY has risen by 4%. Already this outperforms SPY who's down about 10% in the last year, but then again so does buying a first hand car and running up the miles or hiring a few dozen prozzies.\n\nAnother factor to take into account is that BBBY has met one of its biggest resistances/targets, the 200-day moving average. This breakthrough has been covered quite extensively on the subreddit, but I think it's significant enough to mention.\n\nOverall I'd say so far a pretty strong buy. But many posts tell you if you should buy or sell, but not how much and how to maximise profits. I'm here to help you out.\n\nThere are 15 \\*4-minute segments\\* in an hour (citation needed). The NYSE is open for 8 hours. 15\\*8 is 120, pretty standard maths here.\n\nA 4% growth in 4 minutes can be extrapolated throughout the day, I'll represent it with notation. With 120 of these \\*4-minute segments\\*, each returning 4%, we can use exponentials to work out.\n\n1.04\\^120 is about 110. That means over the course of this day, the stock will multiply in price by about 110 times. Now, of course, 4% is just an average, it'd be ludicrous for the stock to move upwards by 4% in every single segment. Some segments may just go up 2% or so, some may go up 6% or so, and some segments may even go down a bit, but overall, we should start to see the average converge to 4%.\n\n110 times the starting price of 16 is 1,760. Therefore, my financial advice (don't take this as financial advice it's just a saying) is to purchase out of the money, 0-day expiry calls options at $1,760. Of course, because of probability, the stock might not reach an average of 4%, maybe just 3.9% or even less is possible, but even so, you can just sell your options before the day is done at a significant markup. If you want to ensure you can exercise your option, you can set your sights a bit lower, perhaps create a call option for $1,500 on the conservative end. \n\nOf course, yahoo finance being the cocksuckers of the hedgies they are, while on break of pumping out article after article bashing BBBY, have provided us with some options.\n\nThe most out-of-the-money call is at 45 bucks, but I'm sure if we all want to buy some $1,760 options from some sucker who can't do maths, we could probably find one. Funny enough, I'm actually selling a few myself. Since this is a guaranteed money maker, I'll sell you a contract of 100 shares at $1,760 for just $5. Buy a contract for 10,000 shares, and it'll just be $495.

But due to recent events, a spark has ignited in my ape heart to share this tale with those of you who may find it one that is enjoyable, laughable, nostalgic, or dare I say another crayon to add to your 24-pack to replace the one you chewed on all day today. This post will contain my own story as well as media from the time period it takes place.\n\nThough this may be my first post on WSB, I have been here for a few years. I do not claim to be a veteran or historian. I discovered this sub at the beginning of COVID. I was sent home from college, told in 2 weeks we\'d return to finish the semester, only to later graduate from home and online. \n\nAt times I\'ve watched you retards from afar, losing hundreds of thousands on ridiculous 0DTE SPY calls and puts. I laughed along with the majority of the community at the "loss porn" though this was not all I\'d witnessed. I saw you fuckers making mad money long before Jim Cramer on $TSLA, $NIO, $PLUG, $PLTN, $ZM, and many others. A healthy influx of tendies was bringing attention to this community of helmet-wearing degenerates. You all certainly caught mine, and I decided to join.\n\nI soon began my first real job in May of 2020. I also began my first investment account. I worked in the engineering field. With a decent wage, booming economy / stock market, and being incapable of spelling the word "inflation", I soon began making sweet gains off of everything I\'d invested in. In the first 5 months I\'d turn $15k into around $32k. Rookies numbers by the book of WSB, and fairly so. I rode beginner\'s luck to the end of the rainbow, where I would soon find King Crayola himself, DFV.\n\nNow we all know the way this story ends, and so you may wonder why I use the Lord\'s name in vain. But in the beginning, there was no light. There was tinfoil. There was disbelief. There was Wendy\'s applications being DM\'d (probably). AND... there was conviction. Stronger than any man\'s I\'d seen. DFV\'s calls were an unstoppable force, his shares immovable objects, his hands made of DIAMOND. No matter what anyone commented, he knew what he was doing. What he did not know, was the quite literal GLOBAL phenemenon (can one of you fuckers tell me how to spell this word) that was about to begin.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Here is where my WSB story begins.\n\n[Half man half ape](https://preview.redd.it/jcjkvts5rki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=126a05f9712c6e273b47501ae1aaf302f91df733)\n\nBefore they were referred to as "meme stocks" they were just tickers that were booming. $GME had made a "steady" but explosive run from around $4 to just under $40. A 1000% increase fueled by what... a float short of 141% if I remember correctly? And despite what any of you may say, this was the core. DFV\'s bet on $GME was that the shorts would get burnt, that the amount of shares shorted was over the amount even available. In WSB terms, shorts r fuk. And once WSB as a forum opened their ape brains to this idea, it was like archduke franz ferdinand had just been assassinated. A world war was brewing between the untied nation of retardation and Melvin fucking Capital. And many, many others would join the war soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Full Ape](https://preview.redd.it/avuwlidktki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa105c47ecf290dad20bd6c103201e562f7f6e09)\n\nAs I sat at my desk job having just thrown my entire investment account into $GME, I\'d officially gone full retard. Literally, I couldn\'t fucking get shit done at work to save my life. I\'d just seen about half my year\'s salary in unrealized gains in a couple hours. I was an excited and anxious mess, glued to my phone like peanut butter flavored weed to snoop dogg\'s tongue. And so the rollercoaster of emotions had started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Palms are sweaty, knees weak, ma we can afford name-brand spaghetti](https://preview.redd.it/lfeqiil7uki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfc337f02b25e155fff5146d7e6b5abd6b449b80)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ma put back the name-brand spaghetti](https://preview.redd.it/ygr2kjziuki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=217e16aa735ee6991364b4f3b56b64545020b1f1)\n\nI\'d seen $80k turn back to $38k in TWO HOURS.

During this time we find many new allies joining our cause. Elon Musk, some billionaire indian investor, Dave fucking Portnoy who turned out to be a paper-handed bitch, AOC before the feet pics, and idk do you guys remember that weird Nordic guy on twitter? Kjetill Stjerne? He was there for a minute too.

A LOT that happened between these 4 pics. I watched myself lose over $100,000 in 10 minutes. Thegoatbro felt like thedumbfuckhobo. But in the end, we made some money. Which for WSB, is a pretty big accomplishment at times. Even given that fact, I had been defeated. My exit plan was thrown out the window, and to that I had blamed the WSB echo-chamber of "HOLD THE LINE" for a long time, though I do know it is my own fault. It hurt in every way possible to accept the mistake I\'d made with $GME, but I accept it nonetheless. I have learned a lot about myself through this experience, and a lot about who I believe we are should we choose to follow or participate in this sub.\n\nWe are individuals. We are investors, whether we describe ourselves as that or not. Ryan Cohen made the best move for himself this week, and no one can fault him for that. We are retarded. Very retarded. We are apes, and apes together strong. We are not investment advice. We are not financial advisors. We are charitable, some of us heroes even, with the tendies we rarely walk away with. We are real people not actors. We are a casino and a Wendy\'s. We are the Tendy Man my friends.

SPY- 422.14 (hit), Apple 171.52 (hit) and VIX 20.59 (hit). So all three conditions to make me consider the top was in hit today… however I did not go long on puts yet today and here is why. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmw5knf4jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d251511037330a044881177d14b0b2b3f9dcd498\n\nIf you are to put todays (on the left above) and yesterdays (on the right above) 15min intraday trading charts right next to eachother what do you see? You see consolidation. Today we opened pretty deep red and had a nice 30 minute sell off but after that the bulls were just as much in the game as the bears were. This was not some sort of capitulation, top is in, send this to the 360s tomorrow day. This felt almost like a “slip” by the bulls. I did not see the crazy sell pressures and the crazy straight down trend day all day like I was looking for despite hitting all my price targets. The thing that happened was we had a big red pre market that helped us get to those price targets. The actually intraday trading today was essentially just another range day. \n\nI want to have the weekend for the markets and everyone else to maul over whether the next leg down is beginning or not. There are still a few more things I would like to see first. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3n150my4jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a510737b95b36b7b1cb0c3ceb9b49b51dc806da\n\nOn SPY daily chart you can see that we finally broke the 9 week long bull support. And this wasn’t just a small retracement through it like back on August 9th this was a clear break through it. \n\nBear case- We saw the red 9 week long support line broke, the daily 8ema was broken and closed beneath, we failed to resttest the bear market resistance after hitting it, we had 104% of the 30day average volume today (this means that there was a lot of activity as in sellers greatly outweighed buyers… not just that no one was buying). This is the reddest close SPY has had since June 28th which did lead to a small sell off. \n\nBull case- Despite breaking support we still managed to hold 422 as support. SPY has now spent 6 trading days between the 422 and 430 levels. This could be just consolidation with the final rest before we push to the next level up. Despite opening red and immediately selling off the bulls did not let this turn into a massively red day and also prevented the VIX from escalating too much. Despite today being the reddest close for SPY since June 28th which did lead to a 3 day sell off that actually then led to the current rally we are in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfi2ukm5jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca338b125c35906ea821d1677b77b0b1636a7723\n\nThe SPY weekly finished about how I expected with that nice gravestone doji. The candle body also closed below the previous weeks candle. I do believe looking at the weekly candle that we are at the top. However, one thing to note about the December and March tops is that despite similar candles the Friday close and Monday opening price were +0.3% in December and +0.2% in March. So that means we have most likely will open green Monday and we shouldn’t really expect a -2% gap down Monday (this is also why I was okay waiting to open a position). \n\nThe weekly is still holding its 9 week long bull support… the daily breaking its bull support though should mean that Monday we break through our support. \n\nI will be looking for Monday to open below the 428.4 support level. There is very little chance we gap up $6 Monday and hold that all week. \n\nKey major supports for SPY next week-\n\n417.5 (daily 200ema and level support) -&gt; 414.5 (daily 20 ema) -&gt; 412.75 (gap fill)  -&gt; 410 (daily 100ema) -&gt; 405.4 (daily level support and daily 50ema) \n\nKey major resistance for SPY next week-\n\n424.6 (black downward line) -&gt; 429.7 (daily level resistance) -&gt; 431 (weekly bear market resistance line) \n\nOverall when you look at Spy its clear to me that the top is in. There is a slight case to be made that this is consolidation and that we chop here for a week before our next leg down. However, look at the way the market has “turned” and overall sentiment has turned in the market I wouldn’t be surprised to see a flat to red day Monday followed by the leg down. Monday I will most likely go into my puts EOD as long as its not a massively big green day. \n\nIf we happen to get a big green day Monday or come out hella bullish then I would wait until we retest 429.7/ 431 to see if they retest and break through bear market resistance or not. There is a case to be made still for 460 before the next CPI in September. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ajvfyyg6jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a209d151a07910f9ce1602ace4f260588a246f\n\nFutures daily also broke is red 9 week long bull support finally and still has not touched actual bear market resistance yet. \n\nKey supports-\n\n4188 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 4120 (daily 100ema) -&gt; 4073 (daily 50ema) \n\nKey resistance-\n\n4278 -&gt; 4310 (bear market resistance) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iccj3i27jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d33e0ddec6055c47e030d05ed8633a623c83170\n\nFutures weekly closed out almost identical to spy. We are seeing closer to a true double top here though. Overall I will be looking to see the weekly bear market support of 4275 broken Sunday night at open and from there we should see the start of the sell off. Like SPY though there is always a chance we could see a final green push that touches the actual weekly bear market resistance at 4325 (which would also make a perfect double top) before we see the leg down. Being that SPY touched resistance and ES did not I do have that thought in the back of my head. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uz7j8qn7jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe10607d46561a53a39efd4ef006eddd185d92fa\n\nApple is honestly the main reason I did not go long on puts yet. I see we hit my price target of 172.3 which is great and all but I really wanted to see a bigger sell off. On Apple it bounced off the daily 8ema and did not close below it. This is the reddest day for Apple though since July 18th. \n\nA few things that have me hestitating that the actual top is in is that on Apple we broke the 3 week long black bull support line but we have still not even touched the 9 week long red bull support since July 26th. I would like to see this tested and broken officially. This also was not that red of a day in terms of Apple compared to the green days we have seen Apple having. This really seemed more like a rest day then a true drill day. \n\nKey levels to watch on apple\n\nSupport-\n\n169.9 (red bull support on Monday) -&gt; 167.6 -&gt; 164.9 (gap fill) \n\nResistance- \n\n173 -&gt; 174.5 (bear market resistance)\n\nIf I can see Apple on Monday especially break through that red bull support I would consider some 14-30dte puts to ride down to the 164.9 gap fill. I think that would be a very high probability play. There is another gap down at 157.5 but we could see the gap fill, consolidation and then either move back up or down. So I would hesitate a longer dte here and wouldn’t hold it pass the gap fill. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wovgxoe8jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5eaaa694d543bf591ad242d815504251062e798\n\nAlright so the VIX final is doing something right? Well yes and no. So we finally broke this massive falling wedge. So that means bottom of VIX is in and we are going to rocket to 40 right? Well no not really honestly. Despite that we still closed within this 19.5 to 20.5 range. It was a good start for sure. But I like I have said many times before would really like to see VIX close to 22 and put more than one green day in to really sell it. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nAs you guys who follow me or are in the server I really struggled the last month. My main struggle came from failure to mitigate my losses. I would feel so confident in my plays that I would marry them and by time I finally realized how toxic the relationship was for me… they would take everything I have. I finally last week said enough is enough and I have started doing a 20% trailing stop order that is opened with any play I open. I mitigated my losses very well this week. And I was able to lock in a green week this week. It was not some amazingly green week where you put it on your fridge… but it was a really good step forward for me. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29zog4y8jri91.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a6d85e441c10cd3b5d3a7ae84f7b01a88ad9ac7\n\nOverall I locked in a green week. Again nothing to get too excited about. While its not an excuse but due to a crummy last few weeks I did use about ½ my normal position size Monday through Wednesday which did mean when Thursday came and I finally felt “confident” and took two losses and a loss today that I erased a lot of gains. However, again still a good week. \n\nIt’s a good step forward in being mechanical in taking profits and locking in gains. \n\nI did have a few issues this week with LIMIT orders that I missed probs 5-7 solid plays this week because I could not get filled on a limit order and by time I was ready to be filled the play had moved 10-20% already and then I was chasing. I am going to evaluate going back to market orders for opening like I used to. I did have one case also of a limit sell not being filled but overall my sells have been fine besides one play that missed. \n\nI look forward to this being one big step back in the right direction. \n\nI hope you guys have a great weekend and I will see you guys on Monday ! \n\nYoutube video will be up later… im about to start on it.'), ('How will SPY close on Monday August 22nd?', 'How will SPY close on Monday August 22nd?&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j551gghilui91.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b617915dec2efbebaeb50afbf087dc80cfa1a2c4\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/wt45t6)')], '2022-08-21': [("What's the word on TSLA this week with the split coming.", "What's the word on TSLA this week with the split coming.[removed]"), ('This is the result of 10 billion dollars worth of investment!

Y’all know what that means. I\'m not talking about having a party lol, that is for me. You guys have to decipher this long post so that you can protect yourself from the upcoming danger that I am seeing. In short you’re fucked if you don’t read this especially institutions and hedge funds. Just for this week please avoid strip clubs. This one\'s for you guys because you read my post. ( I like to think so )\n\nRetail public especially retards i don’t have words for you guys. You guys can chill this weekend because all you do is sh9t on my post. Might as well sh9t on this too. I don’t care since all you’re obsessed with is Ryan Cohen and $BBBY. So when you’re finally over him after getting drunk this weekend then you can go ahead and read this post. Could be worth your time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for people asking me why I don\'t give my opinions regarding meme stocks. Well folks the reason is simple. We are still in a bear market according to my calculations. So it\'s written somewhere in the gospel of investing that bear markets are the opportunities to analyze value companies, not meme companies which are about to be purge in the upcoming mega crash as an offering to please the gods of stock market.\n\nYes you “You-tube” folks the crash hasn’t even started yet. We still have -53% to go from here till March 2023 as my base case. Don\'t even ask me about my worst case.

It’s been a long time hasn’t it. God I was gone for a while and had Ni-san use my Reddit account for a few days. First of all, I\'m gonna apologize for the Shzio post by my brother Itachi. Man, it felt like it messed up my brains for a while there. It was so damn trippy.  So I highly highly advise you guys not to go and read it a second time. Please, it\'s for your own health. \n\nRegardless i love my brother analysis coz he thinks like no other normal people do in the world of trading/investing. So, I take full responsibility for my actions and if things don\'t go as planned out in the above charts ( i.e the mega crash doesn’t happen you know ) then you’re not gonna hear from us.\n\nP.s. We promised you that we will do these posts only in bear markets. Even if the USA goes into depression for 10 to 15 years we will post in a week or two until we visit ath ( all time high ) once again. One may ask why not do this stuff in the bull market? Guys you have to understand we are not bull market specialists. For bull markets it\'s generally advised to follow moon boys on twitter, tik-tok, You-tube etc. They are more educated and well informed than us in that department with a huge audience behind them. ( They spend so much on marketing lol )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recap : Predictions 2022 so far.**\n\nI don’t usually like to do this because my readers already know about this but it’s time to back-test how accurate we ( i.e. me and my brother ) have been this whole time especially to show random people who are new to reading these kinds of posts especially when it’s season finale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* We predicted the March 16 post Fomc rally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6n7xv1xs52j91.png?width=1851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef518b9218d0bc29d830fc61927009ece8a66438\n\n* We predicted the April top. Thought it was gonna last two to three days more but it lasted just one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ictvxtex52j91.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1905d15b9028016b853e12dd817097c285d2eac7\n\n* Then we predicted June Fomc bottom which we already mentioned in our first letter. Does “Dante cash deployment $SPX $3600-3700 at trend based 1 fib” ring a bell. ( But then later i said to just sell above 2% because Cpi 8.8% est and Atlanta Fed Gdp -2.1% est scared the sh9t out of me and i changed my strategy from "Riding to the top of the Bear market rally" to "Shorting at the top of bear market rally" )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brojy4p462j91.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a96db2532fe7643a3b03e3f2293102e8c28a06e2\n\n* And now we finally did the same for August top at 15/16 i.e. 200dMA/ 50-61.8% fib retrace which is just a follow up to above June Fomc bottom. post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/da60ccei62j91.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce9e342a4a1f31b7ed9cd4931c8511bdd9368ae5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then there were bond, commodity, Dxy calls that we are not even mentioning.\n\nWhat this all means is that the stock markets have been performing as we had hoped for since February which is like 6-7 months ago. So i guess we are not a broken clock and actually do provide the exact days or should i say the time horizon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Am I a member of secret society i.e. "Illuminati” or have contacts in "Pay pal mafia" ?**\n\nNo guys. I am not a member of secret society nor do i have any contacts. My brother do though. I do want to manage the portfolio of wealthy clients like my brother someday but I\'m too lazy. I just want to take bets and watch anime and Tv shows my entire life. I just finished West world and now i guess i will watch episode 1 of “House of dragons”. ( Why did that producer said bad things about Emilia. Hmm ) As for anime recommendation man its getting hard to find good ones. I\'m just waiting for Chainsaw man now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About my self.**\n\nBefore all of this I was a Computer Science student whose only good skill was learning a hybrid application development platform called Flutter ( By Google ) but now I just write detailed and boring posts on Wall Street bets about anything that comes to my mind for you guys. My predictions come right because of you folks so thank you for taking trades and also I just basically copy pasted 2008 charts ( 32nd death week ) like I do with Git-hub while programming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now will I be wrong in the future?**\n\nOf course I will be. I’m no economist. I just make cases i.e stock market = 1972-73 or 2008 and just bet on them. Also a big hedge fund guy might find my post someday and take the opposite trade against me wrecking people who followed my advice.\n\nHence i always tell you guys “Do your own research“ “This is not financial advice” even though it will be right most of the time. You absolutely should not follow anybody w/o checking out at-least 10 other guys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why take my advice ?**\n\nSo now that we have cleared some of the confusion which I couldn\'t in my Wsb guest talk appearance you might be thinking why we should even consider your advice in the top 10 folks we watch. You’re a nobody. Well folks in my defense i would say it\'s because I gradually improved myself. Earlier my posts were shitty but now they are getting better especially my T.A. And I\'m also learning economics day by day. Do you know guys I didn\'t wanted to write this as final post coz I was actually busy working on other post like “Deciphering Stagflation 70\'s” and “Thermodynamics in Economics” as my farewell post. Yes it\'s true guys the US economy is one giant open system. That’s how Elon Musk and Jerome Powell do calculations about economics. xD\n\nWell enough spoilers about the next season. I know you guys are getting bored. So lets now finally jump in what i wanted to actually talk about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Experiment :**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Deriving conclusions about Nasdaq, S&amp;P500 and rest other asset classes using other asset classes on weekly and monthly charts.

I mean as much as I love European countries but I have to say your Eur-usd charts sucks equally much. Putin owns you guys this winter. Italy and Germany are already suffering so much with 10x bills gas + electricity if compared with 2021 so i can\'t even imagine about countries like Spain, Greece etc. Okay so I\'m gonna stop myself now with the pessimism and dive into Technicals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )\n\n* Eur-usd bull traders have to stop this deadly weekly close otherwise the whole world is f’ed.\n* Elliot wave C wants to go 1.618 i.e. 0.924.\n* Stochastic RSI are about to cross weekly and go down.\n* Pvt(O) if it crosses the blue line and heads down means game over.’\n* We aren’t even testing the Ketlner red upper band. That’s how bearish we are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )\n\n* Eur-usd bull traders couldn\'t stop monthly support i.e 1.03. Rejected it, retested it from below and rejected it again. The double top at 1.24 was deadly too coz you know when we break the support at 1.03 you go down equally much. Hence those red vertical lines.\n* Elliot wave C wants to go 1.618 i.e. 0.81487 so is 0.834 vertical red line support.\n* Stochastic RSI is in deep water. You ain\'t coming out of there any time soon before weekly readjusts.\n* Pvt(O) wants to do nothing and stay flat for a while.\n* We are hanging on the Ketlner upper red band.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : I can confidently say with 1000% certainty that  Eur-usd is going down.

I have to say I\'m a big fan of your honesty if you are reading this. I mean in today\'s world it\'s hard to find someone that honest in a government job. So guys we know inflation is double digit’s over here ( heading to 13% or was it 15% in coming months ) and in September the Bank of England is going with 50 bps. So we already know that Uk is gonna have more than 2Q of -ve Gdp. I hope you Uk folks survive considering you\'re gonna lose jobs, probably go into economic depression because recession is everybody’s base case even of Mr Bailey. So enough details let’s do analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )\n\n* Gbp-usd is in a huge IHS pattern but that doesn’t mean it will go to the upside that easily. Currently the price is testing right shoulder at 1.19. If it breaks then the price will test the head 1.14 and if it doesn’t break and holds then the price will go to 1.42 to test the neckline. After that we shall see whether the IHS breaks or not. Also the volume is supporting the down move.\n* There is no Elliot wave here. But the key thing to note is that if 1.14 breaks then you’re heading to 0.87 levels. Reason being two vertical red lines should be equal.\n* Stochastic RSI has crossed weekly and is about to go down.\n* Pvt(O) if it crosses the blue line and heads down means game over. If it doesn’t break only then you have a chance of at-least going to the neckline.\n* The price action has occupied the whole Ketlner red band. Meaning we are in a bearish downtrend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )\n\n* Just remember we are in the box lock of 1.14 to 1.42 range. The increasing volume is also supporting this downwards move. If i don\'t take any wicks into consideration then it looks like the price has broken 61.8% fib and would likely head downwards to 1 fib cause there is no support of candle closing. So watch out for monthly close here as well and an eye on higher high volume.  Also don\'t forget those red vertical lines. 1.72 - 1.42 , 1.42 - 1.14, so 1.14 - XXX. Do the math.\n* 12345 was completed in Oct 2007 ( Yah that old ) From then we are in the ABC corrective wave. Elliot wave C is still deciding what’s gonna happen with IHS. If it breaks down you’re looking at 0.95.\n* Stochastic RSI is in deep water. You ain\'t coming out of here any time soon.\n* Pvt(O) wants to do nothing and stay flat.\n* We are hanging on the Ketlner red upper band.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : I can confidently say Gbp-usd is going down. Mr Soros if you’re listening to this, let\'s break the “Bank of England” once again. Just for good old times sake.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Usd-Jpy](https://preview.redd.it/onbs70bf82j91.png?width=1918&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac73e6bdb79823496a0f762e30e2fb467f38af61)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Usd-jpy :** If i tell you anything about this forex pair I’m probably Bs’ing you. It’s true guys. Even Mr Kuruda the governor of Boj doesn’t know where the Usd-jpy is gonna go. But what we can speculate is if the dollar becomes so much stronger due to the weakness in the Eur-usd equation then Dxy is gonna pump past 110 and the dollar becomes stronger. Got it. So I could easily play this approach into my thesis by telling you yes this pair is just gonna go up. But I will not do that. Instead I\'m gonna play a devil’s advocate here saying Usd-jpy will go down. So let’s analyze things which are a total waste of your and my time because I\'m gonna reverse this forex you will see how.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly Time Frame Analysis : ( Left chart )\n\n* Traders watch the 136. It’s a critical resistance. A clean break of it would mean 148 otherwise we go 125.\n* Elliott wave 12345 is complete at 136 and now we go for the ABC corrective wave. A will hit you at 116 and the rest is just a made up wave.\n* Stochastic RSI is on bottom and will go up.\n* Pvt(O) too looks like it could go up.\n* Here in this Ketlner channel we are hanging on a lower green band. That’s how bullish we are but I have chosen to take the bear case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonthly Time Frame Analysis : ( Right chart )\n\n* Traders watch the monthly close. If it closes above 136 we go to 148 otherwise down.\n* Elliott wave 12345 is complete at 136 wave. Entire ABC is made up because it all depends on the monthly close.\n* Stochastic RSI is on top flying and looks overbought but who can argue with their unlimited bond buying which in turn has caused the parabolic move.\n* Pvt(O) too looks like it could touch the blue line. If it crosses we fall, if not we go up.\n* Here in this Ketlner channel we are on an upper green band. That’s how extremely bullish we are but I have chosen to take the bear case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo since I took the bear case it doesn\'t look like any bearish to me. Don\'t you agree? So our devil in devil’s advocate looks weak. So to fit our thesis lets reverse this. This is kinda like physics or Math kind of stuff where we proof things by assuming inverse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : I cannot confidently say but I will say Jpy-usd is going up to 148 at my favorite dot com times where Dxy went 120. Hence i’m selling my Yen trust with ticker $FXY.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Step 2 : DXY. A basket of forex currencies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou must be wondering, I\'m gonna introduce another colorful RGB crayon drawing chart on both weekly and monthly. Sorry to disappoint you folks but I\'m not doing that. Instead let’s use our brains.\n\nWe know that US dollar Index i.e. Dxy is used to measure the value of the dollar a/g basket of 6 currencies. The Euro, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, British pound and Swedish krona. Now I\'m not gonna explain you here why dollar is global reserve currency or dollar has more liquidity so let’s just assume that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what happens now is when Eur-usd becomes weaker, investors usually go risk off and buy the safest asset in the world i.e Dollar. Hence the Dxy goes stronger which suggests the dollar is getting stronger coz european buddies will exchange for dollars coz its very liquid and due to interest rate differentials. ( Remember Gbp-usd is an exception to interest rate differential coz what\'s happening over there is interest rates will go up but their currency is still losing its strength )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have discussed a thesis in past letters already and came to a conclusion and I quote.\n\n“Eur-usd is a mirror image of the Dxy chart.” Remember this for your lifetime. Especially you Gen-z.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn’t gonna post a chart but then I realized I should for new folks who are lazy to read past posts. Eur-usd breaks parity and goes 0.80 levels Dxy will be 120 for sure. In monthly Dxy is super bullish. And on a weekly basis it\'s trying to close above 107 i believe. Hence your Voldemort asset class dropped -8% i guess. Right ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mirror chart : DXY vs Eur-usd](https://preview.redd.it/pphup5l792j91.png?width=1637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a182585c747ec04f6078572bd4dab7091d12f81)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : I can confidently say Dollar or  DXY is getting stronger in comparison to Euro, Gbp and Jpy. Hence DXY to 120 is back on the table according to the “20yrs of wyckoff accumulation” pattern. If you cleanly break 110-112 i must say equities especially the Spx is gonna visit to my $3200 level.**\n\n**Now some Cnbc or Bloomberg guys who stole my research and didn’t gave me credit 2-3 months ago used to come on tv and say things like “Oh in 2018 Spx visited 200wMA so it makes sense that this cycle which is even more tightening compared to last makes sense to visit this range.”**\n\n**So folks now the Spx has shifted its 200wMA/50mMA = $3500-$3600. But these clowns oops economists don\'t know that we should take a look at the monthly chart. Once you open that. Your pants are about to drop coz in the last tightening we visited not 200wMA but 100 monthly moving average i.e 100mMA. Yeah let’s go visit makachev vs oliviera in oct 23rd ufc 280. So if we cross paths over there I will tell you we are going to Spx $2873 i.e. somewhere around $2800-2900 which my close friend Dr Burry suggested too. Hence he sold + he is shorting coz he has relieved every moment in 2008. So he knows what’s coming next. You guys don’t.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Step 3 :Eur-usd  Implied Fed funds 100-CME:GEZ2023 ( Not gonna use Elliot wave + Fib trend starting here now )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is like gonna be super high level stuff even far above my pay grade. Only Zoltan can explain this using repo markets but since he is busy I will try to explain it in a funny way. So if you might have watched Cnbc this past week two economists were arguing about how Fed funds have priced in 4% already but one might be saying no it has only priced in 3.4-3.5%. So who is right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you watch “Everything money” by my suggestion then Mo came to the conclusion that the reason he is saying 4% is because the Fed is doing QT + rate hikes which Mo still does not believe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo who is right and what is the right explanation for 4% ?\n\nImo they both are right but the explanation is wrong. The reason one should present about the 4% Fed funds argument is that in Eur-usd implied Fed funds went to 4%. Hence the market has priced 4% in the euro dollar banking system. But if you take only the dollar banking system in Usa then we look at yields of 2 yr and 10 yr which are hinting that Fed funds 3.4-3.5% is already priced in by the markets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Eur-usd implied Fed funds.](https://preview.redd.it/1e44kz7n92j91.png?width=1917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ed1184c16108f660d104edbd1ceac6e0b786f46)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonthly and weekly time frame analysis :\n\n* Both look strong on a monthly and weekly basis. If monthly candle closes above resistance i.e. 3.50 this month then we are looking past 4% Eur-usd implied fed funds\n* Stochastic Rsi on weekly and crossed and is heading up while on monthly they are about to cross and hover above for a while.\n* Pvt(O) on weekly looks promising as compared to monthly.\n* Both of them don’t wanna lose their lower green Ketlner band.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : I can confidently say that we are going up here technically. So J. Powell, could you please back me up on this. Zoltan agrees with me. Snyder doesn’t.** \n\n**( Just remember implied fed funds can go up due to Eur-usd weakness. So its kinda like indirect interest rate hike for markets. Add QT on top of that. Hence Fed is dovish in Fomc minutes for rate hikes )**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Step 4 : HYG &amp; LQD : The corporate bonds\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[HYG](https://preview.redd.it/xwav70t8a2j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b03c2b697eaabdb09728007e8699c1f158e40810)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHyg : This product is designed to replicate a benchmark which provides a broad representation of the U.S. dollar-denominated high yield liquid corporate bond market. The high yield bond space has been cracked wide open by ETFs, as these products have offered numerous ways for investors to take advantage of this space. High yields can be a great addition to a yield-starved portfolio, as they can offer yields into the double digits for those willing to take on the risks that come along with it. The high returns come from riskier bond choices who have to pay out higher ratios to compensate investors for high risks. This means that the holdings of these ETFs will have higher chances of defaults, and could potentially leave investors out to dry. But those who have done their homework on the holdings of a particular “junk” bond fund have the ability to generate strong returns from these powerful products. HYG keeps most of its assets inside of the U.S., though it does offer a slice of international exposure as well. The ETF is dominated by corporate bonds, the majority of which have investment grades between B and BB. This product will make a great income addition to any investor who is fully aware of the risks a high yield bond product carries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly time frame analysis :\n\n* Weekly is gonna print bearish engulfing candle. Also there is a volume divergence. Price going up but volume going down which leads to fall. Trend line break candles will be the nail on the coffin.\n* Stochastic Rsi on weekly crossed and now are heading down.\n* Pvt(O) on weekly is also done after releasing supply and now will head down to accumulation..\n* Ketlner middle line changing band rejected the price action suggesting bearish continuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonthly time frame analysis :\n\n* Monthly rejected its previous to previous top of the candle and is gonna print another st. down red monthly. Again price ascending volume declining.\n* But interestingly stochastic Rsi on monthly going up..\n* Pvt(O) on monthly also about to cross its blue line later sometimes.\n* As for Ketlner, well it\'s pretty much occupying the entire red lower band.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLQD : I leave it up to you guys. Cmon at least do one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : I cannot confidently say that we are going down on a monthly time frame ( i need to see more data ) but yah sure on weekly we are going down because of that deadly candle that folks have been talking about.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Step 5 : IEI/HYG : Government bond price / Corporate bond price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[IEI\\/HYG : Double check below thing.](https://preview.redd.it/i3bbj0fda2j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36056c59d1b790618d5af8006a9bafec16ea7884)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIEI/HYG : If it goes up then credit spreads are widening. ( Bad thing i.e risk off )\n\nIEI/HYG : If it goes down then credit spreads are tightening. ( Good thing i.e. risk on )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly time frame analysis :\n\n* Weekly is about to print a bullish engulfing candle. Also volume isn’t supporting downwards move i.e. price is going down but volume is going down as well.\n* Stochastic Rsi on weekly crossed and now are heading up.\n* Can\'t comment about Pvt(O) weekly. Mixed signals\n* Ketlner middle line changing band supported the price action and is green. Meaning bullish continuation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonthly time frame analysis :\n\n* No complete data on monthly that we can make assumptions.\n* But stochastic Rsi crossed on monthly and suggested going down.\n* Pvt(O) flat.\n* As for Ketlner, well we had rejection from an extremely bullish green band i.e. we haven\'t gotten permission for capitulation but we got support from middle Ketlner to make the price go up again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : I cannot confidently say that we are going up on a monthly time frame ( i need to see more data ) but yah sure on weekly we are going up.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Step 6 : ( Super scary ) : Velocity of m2 or m1 money supply i.e v = us gdp / m1 or m2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Velocity of M2](https://preview.redd.it/63y690uka2j91.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=259b9d0855aacf6aae7f97a74591f5408b1ad7da)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a very debatable topic. Only the pros have the right to argue about this stuff and no one else. Peter lynch once told me during my time travel visit that people worry that the velocity of money supply is going up way too fast then we are gonna have depression and if the velocity of money supply goes down then too we are gonna have depression. So which one is it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways Q3 2020 : 1.149 was the highest reading. Currently we are trying to break it. Q2 2022 : 1.147\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"The velocity of money is the frequency at which one unit of currency is used to purchase domestically- produced goods and services within a given time period. In other words, it is the number of times one dollar is spent to buy goods and services per unit of time. If the velocity of money is increasing, then more transactions are occurring between individuals in an economy. This is called an expanding economy." \\~ By Fred website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo go out there and ask your banking friends and tell them please explain the concept of money supply in today\'s terms. Not an old term. So I too went to my brother for advice. He told me “ F off “\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : “F off”**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Step 7 : Gold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are not gonna do weekly and monthly time frame analysis on this. Some of you guys may be like “Dude, I\'m an old man with agricultural land. I wanna own gold like my ancestors from 18th century coz i believe in stagflation, parabolic move, end of the world, negative debasement hedge blah blah” So i need charts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Old man\'s Gold :**\n\nOld man you need to chill. We are gonna use our brain like Peter Schiff. So we know, gold doesn\'t love that his nemesis dollar is going up. Now if you can tell me how high Dxy will go up then i can tell you that the top of Dxy will be the bottom of Gold. Also gold doesn’t love financial crisis or bank runs. In my world gold is a phoenix who rises from ashes. Meaning if we plunge into the abyss then gold is gonna drag us out of there first. Then indices move and other asset classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Digital Gold :**\n\nAs for young folks, you love the King of Voldemort asset class don’t you? So go buy it at amazon bottom i.e. $4-5k or my favorite Richard heart level -83% i.e 10,690. Or if you really don\'t have the patience like probably 99% of the entire world population you buy some % of this commodity for whatever reasons these guys are selling you at $20k. I shall rest my case now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : Dollar i.e. Dxy up = Gold down and vice versa.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Step 8 : TLT/JNK : It’s kinda like IEI/HYG\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan you guys do this please? \n\nHint : Bullish divergence on weekly and monthly. Meaning TLT ( 20yr treasury bond etf by black rock ) buying over Junk bonds i.e. JNK\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Step 9 : US Oil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet\'s go Brandon and the government. Just how much are you gonna manipulate the best inflation hedge alive. You guys have already killed my Gold. Yes you J.P. Morgan traders, I hate you. May your bank dies in upcoming crash and have Panic of 2023 just like  Knickbocker crisis in 1907. Only then I shall have my vengeance a/g those rumors you circulated back in the days.\n\nSo guys you probably would know this that our Usa Government try to manipulate oil market just to please people and ask for votes. These are some of their stupid tactics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Releasing SPR ( i.e. Strategic petroleum reserve ) in the market.\n* Pressurizing Saudis to find oil. ( Btw Saudi Armaco alone made profits greater than all Usa mega cap tech combined )\n* Windfall taxes on Oil companies.\n* Distributing E.V. credits to people. But even E.V. companies are smart. They instead increase their price. Ford I mean what the f you guys are doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the most manipulated market I have ever seen in my 100 yr+ of lifetime. So traders if your conclusion from my above observation was that we should short Oil lemme tell you something in double quotes.\n\n“Be afraid of Putin’s Winter Oil boogeyman”. "Contango is a dangerous thing that futures creates"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou don’t short Oil in winter. Period. Heck you shouldn’t even trade Oil. Only the expert can do this because it\'s called “Widow Maker” i.e. the losses in this commodity trading could be catastrophic planetary devastation like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTip : Btw currently oil is in downwards wedge and it could break to upside and we go up in winter but Oil too like gold doesn\'t love Dxy going up. So kinda mixed signals i guess. Let\'s see who shall prevail bulls or bears of oil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : Dollar i.e. Dxy up = Oil down and vice versa but Winter is coming/ Contango = Maybe Oil up.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Step 10 : Powell curve i.e.10 yr - 3 month, 2 yr - 3 month ( Pvt(o) and Elliot wave doesn\'t work here )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you guys remember the talk we had with Powell earlier this year when he was trying to explain us that the inversion of the 10 yr - 2 yr curve doesn\'t mean anything and unless the near term curve inverts it\'s all okay. Well folks Powell near time curves are close to getting inverted. Therefore you’re seeing these Fed officials talk dovish recently. Coz if they invert Fed will lose their remaining 0.0000001% credibility. So let’s analyze them on a weekly time frame because on a monthly time frame they look super super bearish to me and there is no chance that the curve won’t invert at some point later on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[J Powell\\/ Fed Curves : Us10y-Us03m , Us02y-Us03m](https://preview.redd.it/djrc8jaf83j91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5d99ee474cadfaa810f9d14a4dd3ac350a9591a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly time frame analysis :\n\n* The current weekly candle in both curves are going to close lower than previous week which could suggest further downside risk.\n* Stochastic Rsi on 10yr-3m looks flat dead whereas on 2yr-3m it looks like it is rising.\n* MacD in both of them is showing us that the downwards declining move is losing its strength.\n* As for Ketlner, well in both of them they are staying in the lower red band suggesting they are still in a bearish trend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLarry Summers former Fed chairman came recently to Bloomberg saying that the Fed has shown in latest minutes that they don’t even know what they are doing. Hence they Bs’ing us in their statement. I mean guys just read these hawkish and dovish points yourself. Also do check out the hidden statements in minutes which are pieces of advice for billionaires about liquidity and t-bills. Don’t forget my warning about bank runs. They are coming. My bet is Well’s Fargo Oct 2022/23 = Lehman brothers Oct 2008 or you could also go with lowest read by a bank in Fed stress test.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Hawkish vs Dovish vs Billionaire\'s \\( Highlighted in blue \\) Fed minutes.](https://preview.redd.it/omb5j3ws83j91.png?width=1758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6158e6604b455fbd85a1d9a922db7ce00ec1e833)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for individual bonds and overall yield curve : \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bonds :**\n\n* Well 10 yr yields looks so good on both weekly and monthly time frame. So we go up in yields.\n* 2 yr yields  look so good on weekly and waiting for monthly close making it bullish. Meaning on September Fed is gonna be dead. ( Yields will rise meaning bond prices go down with stocks )\n\nNote : Once again i\'m telling yields is going up due to Eur-usd down i.e. Dxy up and markets front running 95B/m QT. We are quite unsure about rate hikes coz its nearly 50-50 b/w 50 and 75 bps. It will all depend on Cpi and Jobs data in September.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Institutions and Hf’s are also buying Chinese bonds like crazy or maybe Chinese themselves because of fear of recession and growth slowdown i.e. flight to safety trade. They have deflationary recession but the thing is they have balance sheet recession. So their government is creating a liquidity trap by cutting rates. But don\'t forget they can always do  exuberance amount of liquidity coz they have very less inflation. In Usa you\'re getting rekt in both stocks and bonds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Yield curve :**\n\n* As for the entire yield curve here look at these beauties that Powell has created in these charts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Credits : Eurodollar University. By Jeff Snyder](https://preview.redd.it/in4k23tl83j91.png?width=1427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f8d4fbef2d512895f7d20db2b348b80b9907ebe)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote : Yield should be higher if the time horizon is higher. Meaning shorter end like 2 yr to 5 yr should yield less than 10 yr and 20 yr normally due to unknown risks associated in far future. But look here in these charts. A 52 w t-bill is yielding more than 20 yr and 10 yr bonds. That’s insane. It tells us there is a danger in next 1-2yrs as compared to far in future. The curve has gone banana\'s b/w 26 w t-bill to 10 yr bond. After 10 yr to 20 yr curve looks so good and why won\'t it. Because after the most horrible decade in entire history of Usa will come a little less horrible decade. Haha.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : I can confidently say yields are going up in respective bonds. But will basic yield curve i.e us10y-us02y will steepen or invert more is out of my pay grade.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Step 11 : VIX. It looks so ready to pop anytime.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean what do i even say here. This whole year traders are buying Vix calls in 20 and shorting equities and as the Vix goes 30 they sell their calls and buy puts. Meanwhile longing their equities position.\n\nSo smart Vix traders, it\'s time to integrate the mega crash in your calculations. Meaning do the first phase of second part but leave tf out of second phase of second part i.e. don\'t buy puts on Vix and don\'t try to long equity in 30 coz this time folks are going to promised Vix 40+.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Result : Vix is going up. Reason : It\'s mid terms + Putin x Jinpig x Biden at G8 = Volatility in Sept - Nov.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Conclusion :**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinancial derivation = Take those steps into consideration that you are confident in your analysis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So I chose my Eur-usd pokemon.**\n\nReason : I am quite confident in my analysis and Lagarde. Plus Fed minutes made a commentary about this that dollar is looking so strong as comparison to Euro. Maybe this too played a part in their recent dovish commentary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Assuming :** Eur usd is going down coz Europe is f’ed. ( We were most confident about this in all of our steps. Also my birdie told me 0.93 eur-usd traders have risen from their grave in options market )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Above assumption ( proving in step 1 t.a. ) will mean :**\n\n* Dxy go up due to the mirror chart theory.  ( 0.80-0.90 levels in eur-usd = 120 move in Dxy )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* So now equities, commodities, metals and rest other asset class will fall down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what about bonds?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Well when the dollar strengthens then the countries who have dollar denominated debts have to sell their bonds and buy new bonds to refinance. Something like that. I think i butchered it. But yah it happens. Other reason being when dollar strengthens due to ext factors then its kinda like a rate hike. So since bonds don\'t like rate hike they sell off. Now add QT on top of it i.e 95B/m  + Us treasury will issue more long term bonds and cut treasury bill issuance. So 10yr to 20yr bond yields will go up.\n* So now remains the case for 2yr bonds. The Fed will hike rates but it\'s kinda hinting that they won\'t go aggressive now coz they don\'t wanna overshoot and bring depression. Hence the 2yr bond will not go up more than the back end i.e. 10yr bond. Meaning us10y-us02y will move from inversion territory to steepening territory.\n* T-bills is getting bought more instead of rrp. Hence t-bills are trading below rrp. Meaning billionaires or banks fear about incoming liquidity crisis or collateral shortage. So t-bills it is or cashola. Or you could go to a money market fund and park your money there coz banks don\'t give you anything. Let\'s cause bank run together next year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Also vix will pop up in this scenario due to asset classes being sold off\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The velocity of m2 is gonna go up suggesting economy expands. Nope. Imo its suggesting dollar milkshake theory coz m2 is going down. Less dollars will be in circulation but exchanges will remain same. ( Long shot. I really don\'t know. Just guessing )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Final Result :**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery step we proved above using technical analysis on weekly and monthly time frame is being backed by my financial derivation except one thing. Will us10y-us02y curve invert more or steepen.? Coz steepening is bad for dollar strength whereas more inversion is good for dollar strength i.e. Dxy.\n\nP.s. I think i\'m so confused. Damn these bonds are tough to read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote : I forgot Dr copper. Lol. Why is it going up when Gold and other metals is going down?\n\n\\*\\*\\* Illuminati said : "Coz Dxy move up or bond yields move up is not because of rate hikes. They all are priced in. It\'s because of pseudo rate hikes on the Global market that is causing dollar to strengthen. This is due to QT + Eur-usd , Gbp-usd going down. Throw Japanese yen in there too but its chart is going up coz its Usd-jpy pair not Jpy-usd. Just like i said before too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Farewell :**\n\nThank you guys for your patience in reading an 8yr old post with naruto references w/o even mentioning Naruto anywhere coz Itachi stole the show. xD I am so tired guys coz i was busy writing stuff for you guys whatever was coming to my mind and leaving no mistake in my final calculations.\n\nTake care guys.

(SPY) are down 0.51%\n* NQ! (QQQ) are down 0.59%\n\nGood evening everyone, I hope you all had a relaxing and refreshing weekend and are ready for the market open tomorrow. Before the markets open for a new week it is a good idea to look at the major indices (SPY and QQQ), but also to look at the sector ETFs to see if any sectors are looking particularly strong. That is exactly what I will be going through in this post, we will start by examining SPY and QQQ and then move onto several sector ETFs that are setting up or performing well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0vyxynnd6j91.png?width=2271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47463cc464e609c47fa057f002fa70bd20322834\n\nFirst up is SPY which ran into the 200 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/) as well as a resistance line early last week. We couldn’t get a strong close above these zones and saw SPY get rejected and start to fall. The close below the 8 [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/) was not constructive to the overall market rally. We may see an attempt to push through this resistance zone later in the week but first SPY would need trade sideways for a few days. If we continue downwards we may see a fall to Junes base.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w66pp0aod6j91.png?width=2272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1aa879c55d776099926f674da84fc2708dc3ad7\n\nQQQ has a very similar outlook, however we did actually see a close above the resistance line but quickly fell back below. Again the close below the 8 [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/) is not constructive but does not mean the market rally is done. For now we need to wait until both major indices for a nice base and then push through that base with volume.\n\n**Sector ETFs:**\n\nNow lets move onto the sector ETFs. There are several ways you can trade these, you can purchase the ETF outright and own all of the companies representing the ETF. The downside to this is that you may not see as big of move in ETFs compared to individual stocks, but you also may not see as big a downside. Or instead of buying the entire sector you could look at the largest holdings of each ETF and then purchase the strongest stocks that have a good setup.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cyphobyod6j91.png?width=2288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f98bd8e62c0cd8c0e71afe5a3b2b2cb624513210\n\nERX is a 2x Bullish Energy ETF that is clearing a small bace formed in the past month. This is not the cleanest entry as the base buy point has passed but the ETF is still vary close so this could still be a buy. Would like to see more volume if this continues to push up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n9ht17npd6j91.png?width=2288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b24e25cf53ef5f2b97eacf1e3d8537c4372c7a1c\n\nHACK is a cybersecurity ETF that appears to have bottomed and is attempting to being trending upward. It is still under the 200 [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/) so caution should be exercises if you decide to open a position. A push above last weeks high with volume could be an entry point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ydnghtcqd6j91.png?width=2283&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a1a846a1710bfd539f3206fd04459352d008fab\n\nIBB is a biotech ETF that has formed a nice base going back to February. This ETF has two potential entries, first is a strong push above the 8 and 200 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/), this is the risker entry. Second could be on the breakout of the multi-month base, since this is a base breaking it is less risky than the first entry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l77e8ohtd6j91.png?width=2277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1712c7cc812f9701d0ea5accca18027a97b1ea7\n\nSimilarly to HACK, IGV is in the tech-software sector and is coming off of its recent bottoms. This stock still has a bit to go but could have an entry above the highs of last week. Remember, it is below the 200 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/) so if you open a positions start small.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rcuju85ud6j91.png?width=2279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93c8956445b7f0032b77d2652c3d5509523b79dd\n\nIJH is the S&amp;P Mid-Cap ETF and is looking strong above last weeks highs and the 200 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syh0nmpud6j91.png?width=2251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1e64500d887f30e744561269e5398ef6993a6b4\n\nIVW has a similar setup to IJH except it still has to take out the 200 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/stani5jvd6j91.png?width=2255&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28ddb78c324984c88d65860ef21be7c405493e1c\n\nKRE is a regional banking ETF and has the same setup as IJH.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9adc6hxd6j91.png?width=2270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f12a6a8cc7aca4d108181f2f3293e1ee540b2c20\n\nSame setup as IJH.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gwgp8d5yd6j91.png?width=2260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bea4df8413b4833ff80e860b217f8b91ebcb8488\n\nOIH oil services ETF, has formed a nice base and could have an entry above $243.00 if the price move is followed with a volume surge.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mtbodxnyd6j91.png?width=2268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6660194c80c8b32d66e75517aee188b8ecb2a0a9\n\nPAVE is an infrastructure development ETF and has had a huge run since late July. This ETF is a bit extended to purchase now but some of the stocks with this ETF may setup nicely and could be worth checking out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rww46i6zd6j91.png?width=2269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a2e6c843469e98974c009caf1f6deeec039b70d\n\nSMH is a semiconductor ETF and has a nice base that finished forming last week, a push above this base would be an excellent entry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/37pkwfpzd6j91.png?width=2288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87f0431ad44b9b8016cb2ebea6c6ddd6cf1587ed\n\nTAN is a solar ETF and at this time is extended and very choppy without a clean entry. Several solar names have had large moves and some stocks within this ETF may be wort checking out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hywjttk0e6j91.png?width=2271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f42439df2d0c87579c93352face8da3b01c1bc4b\n\nAnother energy name, XLE a SPDR energy select fund, bit extended but still close to the pivot point. An entry could be taking out Fridays highs with volume.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eu972691e6j91.png?width=2262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=753a168886596f0ffe21515fa0a9889a9a41ce4d\n\nXLF financial select ETF has a small base that formed last week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d7o2rfx1e6j91.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e65ab6f540a2b2004a1f5259b05cb712687de620\n\nAnother biotech ETF, XBI. Break above the 200 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/) and last weeks base would provide and excellent entry.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ge0q05m2e6j91.png?width=2274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5cec874190a9d0ed49b824079a6ae05876aae52\n\nXLK is a technology ETF which is close to breaking above the 200 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/).\n\nAs you can see through scanning the ETFs repeat themes make themselves apparent. We have seen several energy, biotech, mid-cap, and growth ETFs that are setting up. It is very helpful to create a list of sector ETFs that you are able to look through and find which sectors are currently performing the strongest.\n\n**Bringing it all together**\n\nOverall, the general market had a rough end to the week but still has a chance to bounce back. There are several ETFs that have promising setups which could help the market rally higher. Make sure to look into the individual stocks within each ETF to find truly powerful setups. However, many of these ETFs are also below the 200 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/), which means they are not at their strongest. If you enter a position be sure to start small.\n\nLet me know what you think of this post and if there are any improvements I can make!'), ('$NVDA - Thoughts on Earnings this week?', '$NVDA - Thoughts on Earnings this week?NVIDIA is releasing earnings this week.

The stock market continue its pullback that started last week when the indices ran into their May highs. This is still “technically” a market rally but the recent selling has definitely put pressure on this rally. This selloff may be in anticipation of Fed Chief Jerome Powell’s speech which he will give Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This speech will give investors a better idea of what the Feds economic outlook and may contain clues about future rate hikes. We may see lots of sideways action, especially after todays selloff, until Jerome Powell speaks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tn2xz9tmmcj91.png?width=2251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d8109be3058348fe9cf554672b76796ef8ea5a8\n\nSPY gapped down and fell throughout the day without making really any attempt to recover in price. We broke back below Mays previous highs which served a resistance area in early August. With this break and a close below the 21 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/), investors should be cautious about opening large long positions. This combined with the increase in volume we saw today means we need to be careful with new or open positions. Hopefully we will see some consolidation around these levels and a push early next week to new highs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uebiombnmcj91.png?width=2272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9830b0ba207c27e31cdc2e15a455b23a30c5260a\n\nQQQ has a more positive outlook but not by much, the highs from June remain intact as a support zone but we did see a close well below the 21 day EMA. We had slightly less selling volume today but have still not seen any days recently with strong buying volume. QQQ is definitely acting stronger than SPY at the moment but both indices are telling us to be cautious.\n\n**Recap on recent positions:**\n\nI am currently sitting completely in cash. My lost position was in Apple (AAPL) but I was forced out Friday at my buy price.\n\n**Potential Setups:**\n\nIf you read the [ETF and Market Evaluation for 08/21/2022](https://everydaytrades.com/etf-and-market-evaluation-for-08-21-2022/) posted yesterday you will notice many stocks that are doing okay in this environment are in familiar sectors.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d33xlqxnmcj91.png?width=2267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b86e3af541fbc8bf4113841945ee15e6f7996d0a\n\nViper Energy Partners (VNOM) had a huge day today moving up 5.85% on a large volume increase. It stopped just short of its most recent high and has a potential buy point of $31.90. If this triggers and you choose to buy be careful if the market is not acting well. The major indices can play a large role in how an individual stock moves.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pzcm17eomcj91.png?width=2274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e04b2aaea9ad8c221ae9176cdfdc6ecb0ddb5e67\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has a small base with a buy of $306.00. This base is somewhat far from where VRTX closed so if we see this trigger it will need to be associated with heavy volume and a good market.\n\nThere are very few other stocks setting up with high probability trades. Todays decline hurt many stocks regardless of sector. It is interesting however that the sectors showing strength now, primary oil and energy, are the same sectors that where acting strong back in January and February.\n\n**Bringing everything together:**\n\nFollowing todays sharp selloff and Jerome Powell speaking on Friday there are few stocks setting up with nice bases. Buying a stock on a pullback hoping for a bounce off of the 8 day or 21 day EMA is extremely risky at this point. This continues to be a news driven environment and risky positions can quickly turn against you. There are a few sectors that are showing strength but many stocks within them have been damaged by todays selloff. Overall if you open a position you need to be quick to cut losses or take profits earlier than usual.'), ('Spy to $325 in 60 Days', 'Spy to $325 in 60 Dayshttps://youtu.be/WeeNpwQ713I\n\nI’ve been trading for years and have also stuck to longer timeframes trades , generally on the daily or weekly\n\nWe have reached a point of a perfect short on SPY known as divergence\n\nWhere we have a confirmed 3rd touch on trend and a divergence on the stochastic letting us know that we are too “overbought” to keep it simple\n\nThe same thing happened back in Jan for our first major drop of $470 to $420\n\nThen again on March where we went from $460 to $385\n\nAnd now again at $430 where target would be between the range of $324-$365\n\nReal target would actually be $325 looking at market structure and comparing the recent drops from high trend touches\n\nI’m out of all positions on my account and have switch to MARA and SPY Puts\n\nMARA $15 Puts for October\nSPY $420 Oct Puts and $430 Nov Puts\n\nWill be buying more Puts on SPY for late October Sometime this upcoming week\n\nTL;DR SPY go poopy bye bye'), ('When trying to sell my 3 leg options spread it didnt get filled.

Both in general, and for BBBY.**\n\n---\n\nAs a mod, I\'m constantly being accused of being compromised, paid off, etc. etc. \n\nAs of late, the main complaint seems to be that I "only" sticky bearish BBBY posts, not bullish ones. \n\nSo let\'s take a look at everything that\'s been stickied since August 5th, and see if that\'s true!\n\n#FAQ:\n\nQ: Why since August 5th? \n\nA: BBBY was below the market cap threshold before August 5th, and could not be discussed on WSB prior to that. \n\nQ: (I don\'t know, I\'ll add some more questions from the comments when they come)\n\n---\n\n#Methodology:\n\nI took the list of all my stickied threads from the modlog, removed the duplicates, and then manually categorized them all.\n\nI don\'t think any of my categorizations are questionable, but for your curiosity, I\'ve included a full list at the bottom (with links!) if you disagree, let me know and I will update this post accordingly.\n\n---\n\n#Results!\n\nOverall, I pinned 70 *unique* (duplicates removed) posts since and including August 5th.\n\n**BBBY Specific - Summarized**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull|7|\n|Neutral|2|\n|Bear|5|\n|Other|56|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n**BBBY Specific - Detail**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull Serious|6|\n|Bull Shitpost|1|\n|Neutral Shitpost|2|\n|Bear Serious|3|\n|Bear Shitpost|2|\n|Daily Thread|32|\n|Unrelated|24|\n|***Total***|***70***|\n\n\nWhat about those nebulous "Daily Thread" and "Unrelated / Other" categories?\n\n**Daily Threads**\n\n|**Type**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bull BBBY|5|\n|Bear BBBY|1|\n|Daily|22|\n|Earnings|1|\n|Trash|1|\n|Weekend|2|\n|***Total***|***32***|\n\n**Unrelated**\n\n|**Topic**|**Count**|\n:--|--:|\n|Bear AMC|1|\n|Bear GME|1|\n|Bear TSLA|1|\n|*Bear Total*|*3*|\n|Bull AMC|2|\n|Bull GME|1|\n|Bull OXY|1|\n|Bull SPY|5|\n|Bull SQ|1|\n|Bull TSLA|1|\n|*Bull Total*|*11*|\n|Education|1|\n|Legendary Post|2|\n|Meme|1|\n|Neutral Wind|1|\n|News|1|\n|Shitpost|2|\n|Tattoo|2|\n|***Total***|***24***|\n\n---\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThis was fun to put together and only took about an hour. \n\nI was surprised that it was so skewed towards positive posts, but it was interesting that there are more negative BBBY posts being stickied **as a proportion of all BBBY posts stickied** than other tickers. \n\nI\'m curious to see if this changes any opinions, or if people will hold to the fact that WSB is biased in some way.\n\nThere are limitations to this analysis. The biggest that I can think of is how long each post spent stickied. \n\nThis is complicated by the fact that I would have to manually go and hover over every one of the 92 stickied posts (duplicates included!) to see which ones were stickied for how long. (Or maybe I could pull it from the page source?)\n\nAnother limitation is timing. I think it\'s fair to say that those stickied during market hours are more impactful than others. Fortunately for bulls, BBBY megathreads were the only thing stickied during market hours, and BBBY megathreads are (obviously) overwhelmingly bullish.\n\n---\n\n||Category|BBBY Daily?|Topic|Is Dupe|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|["Buying more BBBY puts Monday lfg" by thisismyname2022](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wuab08/buying_more_bbby_puts_monday_lfg/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|["I don’t want bbby to go bankrupt so I just pulled ..." by MrSingh_Entrepreneur](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wub13h/i_dont_want_bbby_to_go_bankrupt_so_i_just_pulled/)|Bear Shitpost| ||Not Dupe|\n|["What Are Your Moves Tomorrow, August 22, 2022" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wu8ppj/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_august_22_2022/)|Daily Thread|Daily||Not Dupe|\n|["Ryan Cohen was an insider when selling his shares...." by DatSlattSlimeBooBong](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtju81/ryan_cohen_was_an_insider_when_selling_his_shares/)|Bull Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|["Why the BABY acquisition premise is circumstantial..." by obiwanjustblowme](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wtnust/why_the_baby_acquisition_premise_is/)|Bear Serious| ||Not Dupe|\n|["Aswath Damodaran - Session 1: Intro to Valuation" by OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wte3eu/aswath_damodaran_session_1_intro_to_valuation/)|Unrelated| |Education|Not Dupe|\n|["Lambo Wen?" by doublejeopardyalex](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wt7agl/lambo_wen/)|Unrelated| |Bear TSLA|Not Dupe|\n|["675% gains on 2 BBBY options.

It also alleges that some of the company\'s senior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter\'s serious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees may be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is Peiter "Mudge" Zatko, who was previously the company\'s head of security, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges that Twitter\'s leadership has misled its own board and government regulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that could allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation, hacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also alleges Twitter does not reliably delete users\' data after they cancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost track of the information, and that it has misled regulators about whether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The whistleblower also says Twitter executives don\'t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become central to Elon Musk\'s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk\'s claims).\n\nAfter this article was initially published, Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, told CNN, "We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding."\n\nRead the full article: [https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html)\n\nElon Musk\'s legal team subpoenaed an Ex-Twitter head of security whistleblower alleging TWTR has major security problems and that it don\'t have the resources to identify the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to.\n\nHow do you think this case will end-up and how will TWTR and TSLA price will react?'), ('Thank u degens!

If you expected a gap fill today to 421 you also got disappointed. If you expected Spy to do anything but trade within the same about $1 range for 4 hours and 45 minutes you too were disappointed… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wh9ay9kywij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b41f21171222dbc0faf44a20d71285503ad34433\n\nI haven’t really see a day where the majority of price action was all within a tight range like that in a very long time. That was a frustratingly boring day to watch. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvgm4h5zwij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40af3217d6375453a83994854a4390a2b4939970\n\nOn the daily you can see we closed out today as a gravestone doji which I have touched on this many times before. A gravestone doji at the top (as in when price is running up) is usually a bearish reversal, however, when we are seeing a gravestone doji at the bottom of a trend (when price is dropping) then that usually is the signal of the bottom. Look at SPY 8-17, 8-9, 8-2 and Apple 8-9, 8-2, 7-26, and 6-17 for examples of what I mean. \n\nThe most bearish thing that occurred today in my opinion is that we attempted to break through the daily 20ema at 414.9 and pretty much hit a brickwall. Once we hit that price and rejected we never saw it even attempted again. The only small bullish caveat here is that we did wick over the daily 20ema which could be seen as a hint of whats to come. \n\nToday price magnet all day was around 413 so of course that will be where we need to watch the most tomorrow. \n\nWith the gap fill at 421.22 now 2.15% away from close it is harder to imagine that bulls fill that gap tomorrow, however, 2% days are not out of the norm and with the VIX closing just over 24 if that were to unwind back down to 20-21 that would be a big push for SPY green. \n\nKey resistance tomorrow-\n\n415.2 (black resistance line) -&gt; 417.5 (daily resistance level and 200ema at 418) -&gt; 420.1\n\nKey support tomorrow-\n\n411.3 -&gt; 409.4 -&gt; 407.6 (support area for the July 29th to present bull run) \n\nSomething to keep in mind that historically the SPY gaps do usually fill within 2 days… of course this doesn’t always happen but it does have a history of doing so… \n\nOverall I am still expecting that over the next two days we are going to push green and see that gap fill on the daily and weekly. Once that gap is filled I believe we will see Friday turn into a fairly red day as we are going to get JPOW talking at the Jackson Hole which he is going to once again say all the same hawkish things he has said for the last 2 months… expect this time markets are actually listening… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6rn0matzwij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4c95afd3974fd0672eb9b847c12c82eb65ceb79\n\nFutures is what I will keep my biggest eye on as we go forward tonight and tomorrow. \n\nWe saw a nice hold of that key 4120 level. As long as bulls can defend 4120 I do see a case to retest that 4130 level. However, if we do lose (close daily below) 4120 then we most likely are going to be looking for 4000 here by next week. \n\nKey support-\n\n4120 -&gt; 4100 -&gt; 4075 -&gt; 4040 (projected new red bull channel) \n\nKey resistance-\n\n4120 (black resistance line) -&gt; 4158 -&gt; 4184 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 4210\n\nOverall the black resistance line that has been showing this current 3 day down cycle is at 4120 tomorrow. In order for that line to hold and therefore trend we have to see ES close below 4120, open below 4120 and never break 4120 tonight or tomorrow. I do not personally for see that happening. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3vfsjh0xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d60c69a4b3cd172ff910fe5fa0f14916ba2aceb0\n\nThere really isn’t much to see on SPY weekly but on the futures weekly you can see we also bounced off of the weekly 8/ 20ema which is trending right at 4118. Overall if we were to see a close below that then that would be a very strong indication of downside to come. If those two EMAs hold as support that’s strong bullish case. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhr71421xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10eda127ba8e591cffca8b513ac440d51c7278cc\n\nUnder SPY I spoke about how a gravestone doji is usually a bullish reversal when we are in a down trend. I highlighted on Apple everytime we had a gravestone doji on Apple daily and you can see almost all of them were followed by a fairly green day. \n\nTo be honest this Apple daily candle closed in no mans land. We are trading within that 166.4 to 167.5 area where due to the gaps and wicks there really hasn’t been much price action at all to gauge sentiment. \n\nWe are nearing the first gap at 165.82 with only 0.9% to go until that gap would be filled tomorrow if we break down.\n\nOverall mostly on Apple I am going to keep a close eye on 166.4. If we were to break down through that support then I would think that the upside for SPY and Apple is more limited this week and that we might either consolidate down here or just drill. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7anznu1xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79fd01b87493626b07d47a1224af96300c89e51c\n\nApple weekly shows that that 166.4 level is a very key support that we should keep and eye on too. \n\nApple and Spy weekly still do have gaps on their charts. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwlhjv83xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=655a6ce205702bf3df406029fdbaff631b852ac8\n\nThe VIX is very interesting here to say the least. So after trading so long down at that 20 level we have now spent two days trading up here around 24. \n\nWe do have the GAP on the VIX which I did mention in my video we have not had one since the June sell off and whenever we do have a VIX gap we don’t usually see it left for more then 2 or 3 days. \n\nVIX also is still rejecting breaking out of this 24.2 level.

I opened that put at 9.5 and price hit 10.2 (so I was up 8%) I set a 2% trailing stop limit (purposefully set it at 2% to limit slip) well it triggered of course at 10 premium… however, TOS didn’t fill me till 9.4. Of course im pissed off and contact them why I have nearly $1 of slippage on a contract like that when I was green and all they could tell me was that “that’s just how market orders work… perhaps you should try a limit order never time.”   \n   \n \n\nTo be honest I have been pretty much over TOS/ TDA crap lately and its only getting worse. They truly don’t care about their customers anymore… but that’s a discussion for another time. \n\nOverall a good day despite the fill issue.

Think of Snowflake stock as a proxy on the torrid growth of cloud computing giants [Amazon.com](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn), [Microsoft](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/msft] and [Alphabet\'s Google](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/googl). Cloud companies continue to post above average growth but SNOW stock is down 55% in 2022. Snowflake sells data analytics and management tools that run on cloud computing platforms.\n\n**SNOW Stock: Biggest Software IPO**\n\nSnowflake\'s fiscal 2023 revenue is expected to grow 68% to $2.03 billion, decelerating from 106% growth last year. Still, at that size, Snowflake\'s sales growth stands out.\n\nSNOW stock pulled off the largest initial public offering ever by a software company in September 2020. The Snowflake IPO raised $3.4 billion.\n\nBecause Snowflake\'s business model is consumption-based rather than subscription-based, investors have raised concerns over a possible U.S. recession curbing demand.\n\nSNOW stock is just turning profitable on an "adjusted" or non-GAAP earnings basis. The company is far away from generating profit using GAAP, or generally accepted accounting principles, which include stock-based compensation.\n\n**Software Stocks Lag S&amp;P 500**\n\n[Software growth stocks](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/software-stocks-software-growth-stocks/) have clawed back somewhat as analysts debate whether the S&amp;P 500\'s gains since mid-June mark a bear market rally or not.\n\nA closely watched software benchmark — [the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV)](https://research.investors.com/stock-quotes/-ishares-exp-tech-sftw-igv.htm) — is down 26% in 2022. The index has under-performed the S&amp;P 500.\n\nSnowflake stock bulls tout its total addressable market — potential customer base in dollars.\n\n"With a robust top-line growth profile, NRR (net revenue retention) sustaining above 170% in recent quarters, TAM expansion  and continued margin improvements, we see a faster path to meaningful free cash flow generation as well as upside to the longer term $10 billion revenue target," Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said in a recent note to clients.\n\nSnowflake hosted a user conference and analyst day in Las Vegas in June. The company said new products in app development, data security and other areas will expand its TAM  to $248 billion by 2027, up from $90 billion last year.\n\n"With its roots in data warehousing, Snowflake has rapidly expanded on all fronts to become a data cloud company," Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said in a note.\n\nAt the user conference, the enterprise software maker reiterated its fiscal 2029 target for $10 billion in product revenue for SNOW stock. Snowflake said it expects its free cash flow margins to improve to 25% from 15%.\n\n**Snowflake Stock: Consumption Business Model**\n\nMost software stocks typically trade as a multiple of forward-looking revenue growth. Snowflake is not a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, company that aims to build recurring subscription revenue.\n\nAt the user event, the company addressed concern over its consumption-based revenue business model. Snowflake revenue is tied to how much data its customers crunch and store. One issue is that usage could slow during a recession.\n\nAnother issue is that customers view Snowflake as expensive if they don\'t control usage. Some analysts say there\'s less transparency and predictability than with subscription-based SaaS business model.\n\nSnowflake in early 2022 made cloud infrastructure changes that impacted how customers are billed and slowed revenue growth.\n\n**Synergy With Cloud Computing Giants**\n\nIn addition, SNOW stock in 2021 dropped off the [IBD Leaderboard](https://get.investors.com/leaderboard/?src=aurljhh#/leaders/leadersnearabuypoint). The Leaderboard is IBD\'s curated list of leading stocks that stand out on technical and fundamental metrics.\n\nMany companies are turning to cloud computing services as part of "[digital transformation](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/digital-transformation-lights-next-spark-software-stocks/)" projects that aim to gain business insights from crunching massive volumes of data. The cloud computing titans offer their own data analytics and management tools.\n\nBut the [cloud giants](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/cloud-computing-are-spending-but-how-much/) make Snowflake\'s platform available to their customers. The reason is Snowflake\'s tools are better at some key tasks, such as letting companies compile, view, analyze and share massive amounts of data in an easy way.\n\nNearly two-fifths of Fortune 500 companies use Snowflake\'s software in the cloud as they move away from on-premise data warehousing products from [Teradata (TDC)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tdc), [Oracle (ORCL)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/orcl) and [IBM (IBM)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ibm).\n\n**Competition Increasing**\n\nFurther, Snowflake stock hit an all-time high of 429 in early December of 2020. But SNOW stock swooned amid analyst concerns over its lofty valuation.\n\nWhether Amazon Web Services or Google cloud ratchet up competition remains a concern for SNOW stock. Plus, competition with privately held Databricks is heating up. A recent funding round valued [Databricks at $28 billion.](https://www.databricks.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/databricks-raises-1-billion-series-g-investment-at-28-billion-valuation)\n\nDatabricks, which uses [artificial intelligence](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/), is expected to launch its own IPO. [Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hpe), with its GreenLake platform, is another rival.\n\nTwo former Oracle engineers — Benoit Dageville and Thierry Cruanes — along with Marcin Zukowski, former chief executive of startup Vectorwise, started Snowflake in 2012. The company holds patents in database architecture, data warehouses and other areas.\n\n**ServiceNow Veterans Lead Company**\n\nSnowflake stock bulls point to its seasoned management team as a strength\n\nSnowflake brought in [Frank Slootman as CEO](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/snowflake-ceo-slootman-ipo-coronavirus-emergency/) in May 2019. Slootman had stepped down as CEO of ServiceNow in early 2017. Former [ServiceNow (NOW)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/now) Chief Financial Officer Mike Scarpelli in 2019 also joined Snowflake in the same CFO position.\n\nUnlike legacy, on-premise data management systems, Snowflake\'s platform was built from the ground up for cloud computing. It provides 100% of its software over the internet.\n\nSnowflake customers can share data with their partners across multiple online storage systems using the company\'s data warehouse. Snowflake also enables easily searchable data to be shared among applications.\n\nSnowflake\'s data analytics tools became available on Amazon Web Services in 2015, Microsoft\'s Azure in 2018 and on Google\'s cloud platform in 2020.\n\nIn June 2021, Snowflake partnered with [C3.ai (AI)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ai). The two companies will cooperate in offering artificial intelligence tools to companies.\n\n**Amazon Web Services A \'Frenemy\'**\n\n"While Snowflake is multi-cloud, it derives some 85% of its revenues from data analytics jobs deployed on Amazon Web Services, which is also Snowflake\'s biggest rival with AWS Redshift," UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said in a recent note to clients.\n\n"This \'frenemy\' relationship is critical to Snowflake\'s success," Keirstead went on to say. "AWS benefits far more from Snowflake spending on compute and storage infrastructure resources than they lose in the form of foregone AWS Redshift revenues."\n\nSnowflake has focused on six core markets, including financial services, health care and life sciences, retail and consumer packaged goods, advertising media and entertainment, technology and the government sector.\n\nWhen Snowflake went public in 2020 it used a dual-class share structure that gave its CEO and insiders [super-voting rights](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tech-companies-ipo-super-voting-rights/). However, Snowflake eliminated the dual-class structure in March 2021.\n\nSnowflake had been based in San Mateo, Calif. Amid the shift to remote work spurred by the coronavirus emergency, Snowflake in May said it no longer has a corporate headquarters. It designated Bozeman, Mont., as its principal executive office, where Slootman and Scarpelli are based.\n\n**Snowflake Stock Fundamental Analysis**\n\nMeanwhile, Snowflake reported a loss for the April quarter that met estimates while revenue topped Wall Street targets. Guidance disappointed, sending shares down.\n\nSnowflake reported a first quarter loss of 53 cents a share using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, compared with a loss of 70 cents per share a year earlier.\n\nRevenue for SNOW stock jumped 85% to $422.4 million from a year earlier. Analysts had estimated Snowflake revenue at $413.7 million. Revenue climbed 101% and 110% in the two previous quarters.\n\nThe Snowflake earnings report said product revenue rose 84% to $394.4 million vs. estimates of $389 million.\n\nFor the current quarter ending in July, Snowflake said it expects product revenue of $437.5 million at the midpoint of guidance vs. analyst estimates of $436.6 million.\n\nIn addition, Snowflake said it now has 206 customers with "trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million," up from 184 such customers as of Jan. 31.\n\n**SNOW Stock Technical Analysis**\n\nSnowflake stock went public on Sept. 16, 2020, at 120 a share. At the time, software growth stocks were hot as investors sought recurring revenue amid the coronavirus emergency.\n\nSNOW stock popped as high as 319 on the first day of trading and closed 111.6% above the IPO price at 253.93. Shares pulled back as analysts debated Snowflake\'s valuation.\n\nSnowflake stock forged a [cup-with-handle base](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cupandhandle.asp) over the next two months. The new base created an entry point of 301. SNOW stock blew past the buy point, hitting an all-time high of 429 on Dec. 8, 2020.\n\n**Expectations For Snowflake\'s Second-Quarter Results Are Low**\n\nAs a start, it is necessary to assess the market\'s current expectations of SNOW\'s financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. In my view, we have low expectations of Snowflake\'s Q2 FY 2023 results based on three key indicators.\n\nThe first indicator is that the sell-side\'s consensus estimates point to a more moderate pace of top line expansion and continued losses for Snowflake.\n\nAccording to the market\'s consensus financial projections taken from S&amp;P Capital IQ, Wall Street expects SNOW\'s revenue growth to slow from +101.5% YoY in Q4 FY 2022 and +84.5% YoY in Q1 FY 2023 to +71.8% for Q2 FY 2023. Also, Snowflake is forecasted to stay in a loss-making position for Q2 FY 2023 with an estimated normalized net loss per share of -$0.01. SNOW was also unprofitable in Q1 FY 2023, but the company previously achieved positive non-GAAP adjusted earnings for both Q3 FY 2022 and Q4 FY 2022.\n\nThe second indicator is that analysts have become less optimistic about Snowflake\'s Q2 FY 2023 performance in recent months as seen with the revisions to SNOW\'s financial forecasts.\n\nIn the last three months, 24 of the 36 sell-side analysts covering Snowflake\'s stock have lowered their respective bottom line estimates for the company. Specifically, the sell-side\'s consensus bottom line projections for SNOW were cut by -11% and -20% in the past one and three months, respectively.\n\nThe third indicator is bearish sell-side commentary on the near-term prospects of SNOW.\n\nEarlier this month there was a [BTIG research](https://research.btig.com/about/) report noting that "a downtick in recent field checks and the fact that cloud hyperscalers started to decelerate" had prompted a reduction in FY 2023 product revenue estimates by the analyst. Another analyst from [UBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS) also cut his or her top line forecast for fiscal 2023 on the basis that "more customers" are "flagging efforts to curtail discretionary data analytics spend."\n\nTLDR: This stock is certainly not a buy right now and for those looking to gamble, puts would be the play. 8/26 150p is about 4.40/share, so I\'ll be grabbing those.'), ('$TSLA stock split?

Plain and simple, they\'re a company that takes something out of the ground and sells it. Usually they take rocks, often shiny ones and sell them for money. Think gold, silver, copper, tin, aluminum, uranium, I could make a giant list, but you get the idea. The big popular one you\'ll all think of is oil. Because I\'m sure you\'ve all seen oil price went up and you\'re looking to just throw cash at any oil stock hoping it\'ll magically go up because reasons. So that\'s what the focus is, something is in the ground that sells for money, a company is going to dig it up and sell it for money so they can dig more up and so on.\n\n**Types of Mining Companies: Explorers**\n\nThere are three types of mining companies, explorers, developers and producers. For this discussion I will be focusing on explorers. I\'ll probably write one up for developers and producers later on, depends on if more than 5 people even read this to begin with. So, the big question, what is an explorer? This is a company that currently has none of the thing they plan to sell. What they do have is a giant patch of land where they hope to find some of that stuff. They\'re "exploring" the land looking for stuff to sell, hence the name. These are the penny stocks of the mining community. You will find a ton of pure garbage here, and I mean hot garbage. How bad? Maybe 10% of all explorers will even manage to find something worth writing about. No not 10% will make money. 10% will find a patch of whatever good enough to even debate TRYING to make money off it. Worse off, a lot of these companies are complete scams. I\'m talking 5 guys got together and made Greg\'s gold mining corp., put themselves as board members, went out to raise capital to buy a plot of land, and plan to sit on that plot, spending tiny amounts while raising money and paying themselves giant salaries for 5-10 years before they go "Well looks like we didn\'t find anything. Guess we have to shut down and keep those salaries we paid ourselves, sorry." And this happens a lot. So be careful playing here. If you think Biotech can have scams you\'ve seen nothing yet getting into mining explorers.\n\n**Explorers: So, If They\'re Trash Why Talk About Them?**\n\nSo, explorers often can be pure hot trash, but here\'s the thing. If you know how to evaluate them and find the good ones (What I hope to teach the 3 of you left still reading) you can see crazy returns. I\'m talking companies going from $0.01 to $10.00 type of returns. See, these companies have so much trash that even potentially good ones often stay cheap, but on the other hand, if they prove they\'re legit that price can jump. Yeah, Greg\'s gold company might be a scam, but Greg\'s gold company also might find a giant gold deposit of super high-quality gold that\'s easy to mine. And here\'s the thing, even if Greg and pals are complete morons who have 0 clue how to build a mine, once they find that high quality deposit big companies will step in looking to buy that land for a whole lot more than Greg and pals paid for it. Yeah, Greg can\'t make a mine, but Barrick Gold sure as heck can, and if the deposit is top quality, they\'ll be willing to pay top dollar for it too. Here\'s a breakdown of more or less what a good scenario looks like. Greg and friend make a company and raise money. They get a patch of land and start exploring for gold. Greg and pals find a patch of gold. They now focus their exploring on that patch to see how good it is, probably raise some more money since they\'re going to want to see how deep and wide that patch goes. They see it\'s deep and wide and the gold grades are high. Barrick Gold sees Greg has a good gold patch. They come in and offer a Joint Venture (JV) with Greg. Barrick will pay for Greg and friends to continue exploring the patch and proving it out (Showing the resource is big enough, the grades high enough, the land can handle a mine and so on) in exchange for a percentage of the company. Greg and pals continue proving out that land, apply for a mining permit with the local government. Permit is granted, they prove out the patch, show there\'s enough infrastructure to be worth mining. Barrick now comes in and offers to buy out Greg\'s gold corp. You, the investor now gets paid. Either a flat payout at an agreed share price or your shares in Greg\'s gold corp. convert to an amount of Barrick Gold shares which you can then keep or sell. That\'s more or less the cycle for an explorer simplified. Now, there are some explorers who don\'t get bought and turn their patch of land into a mine, but it\'s rare. First, most explorers don\'t have that type of cash. Second, their team is usually made up of people who know how to find and evaluate a resource not people who know how to build and operate a mine. They\'d have to hire those people which is expensive. So, if you\'re playing explorers, you’re looking for them to find a good patch, prove it out then be bought out by a bigger company.\n\n**So How Do You Evaluate an Explorer?**\n\nOk, after probably way too many words we are at the part you probably care about, how to tell the good from the trash. Well, here\'s the number 1 thing for an explorer. MANAGEMENT OVER ALL OTHER THINGS. These companies have no resource, they have no mine, they probably don\'t have much of an office honestly. What they do have is a patch of unproven dirt and a team. The value is that team. You need to know who the CEO is and what\'s his/her\'s background. Have they run an explorer before? If so, how did that explorer do? How far did they get? Did they find anything, if so, was it worth anything? Have any of their previous projects been bought out and turned into a successful mine? Past success often shows future success. But there\'s more. Not only do you want to know if they\'ve had success but where and in what. A guy who discovered the world\'s greatest silver mine in Argentina might not know a thing about finding a copper mine in Canada. Someone who helped discover and permit a gold mine in Nigeria might have no clue how to get a similar patch permitted in Australia. They need to have shown they know the resource and the area because that matter. One of my favorite stories is about a company exploring for uranium in Africa. They were having trouble finding anything. Then one day the CEO was sitting down eating lunch and he noticed an ant mound. The ants were carrying these little rocks that caught his eye. Turns out they were uranium. He had his team dig the mound and sure enough they found a high-quality uranium patch. Now what\'s interesting about this story isn\'t that he found uranium luckily through ants. What\'s interesting is using ant mounds to survey an area is a common tactic in Africa, but he didn\'t know that because he never ran a project in Africa. Someone who had would have saved a bunch of money because they would have looked to that ant mound first instead of digging expensive holes in different areas. Knowing local methods is important. Looking for gold in northern Canada? A lot of that surface gold came there through glacial drift. So, you need to know the tectonic patterns of the area, find some surface gold and then trace it for maybe 100+ kilometers to the source where it drifted from to find the original large patch. And yes, that\'s a legit gold exploring strategy used in Northern Canada. If the CEO or head Geologist doesn\'t know that don\'t waste your time on their project in Canada. They\'ll find surface gold but not realize they need to track it and instead waste time diffing up ground that won\'t have gold in it.\n\n**Evaluating an Explorer Continued.**\n\nA great and easy way to evaluate an explorer is by listening to the CEO talk. You should, with limited effort, be able to find YouTube videos of the CEO giving an interview and ideally to a channel that knows what to ask. Some of the channels I like to use are Crux Investors, Resource Talks, Bloor Street Capital, Mining Stock Education, and Kitco News. They all have interviews with a bunch of CEOs across multiple resource spaces along with interviews with sector people who will teach you more about a specific sector you\'re interested in. But regardless, a good CEO should have up at least a couple 15–20-minute YouTube interviews talking about the company. If they don’t, I\'d be worried about them promoting the company. Because YouTube interviews are super cheap for them and gets their company out to a bunch of people. If they\'re not talking, it\'s likely because they don\'t have anything good to say. Now when you watch that interview here\'s what I look for. I want a CEO who is knowledgeable. They should be teaching me things I didn\'t know about the sector, about exploring, their plan, whatever. The more knowledgeable the better. They should be able to talk not just about their specific company but their sector as a whole too. Next, I want an honest CEO. Any explorer, regardless of stage has huge risks. They better be mentioning risks. Now I don\'t need them to trash the company. But as an example, let\'s say they\'ve found a patch of something and they\'re working on a permit. Permits are hard as heck to get. They better not be saying how the permit is coming and they have 0 worry. If they\'re in Canada I better hear them talking about how they\'re working with the First Nation people to get the project going They don\'t mention that at all, I\'m thinking they expect the local First Nation people to oppose them and don\'t want anyone to find out, and that\'s an easy way to have a mine denied in Canada. Also, you might notice this is the 3rd or 4th time I\'ve talked about something specific to Canada. That\'s because it\'s good for you to also be aware of the obstacles of a given area the company is in. Permitting is hard in the US and Canada, but much easier in Africa. On the other hand, Canada and the US don\'t have concerns of a local revolution shutting a mine down like many places in Africa do. Different areas come with unique risks to the project. Ideally, try to stick to one major area and know what common roadblocks and geological things come up. Mining Stock Education has a bunch of videos that\'ll teach you about this if you\'re interested. Back on topic. Last thing, I need to trust the CEO. If ANYTHING AT ALL gives me even the slightest red flag, I don\'t invest. I have looked away from companies because the CEO was too positive to the point of sounding like a used car salesman and that was my deal breaker. Maybe that company works out, IDK and I\'m not risking money to find out. Also check their website. It better be legit and list out the projects they have and give a good description of what they\'re doing. Many of these companies have websites that look fine at first, but then you click around and realize the project page lists the name of a single property with 0 info. RED FLAG!\n\n**Ok I picked a company and invested, now I HODL right?**\n\nNO NO NO NO. Now you pay attention to their news releases. Follow their Twitter and see what they\'re putting out. If they\'re exploring and doing well, they should be talking about new holes they\'re digging, patches they\'ve found, something. They should always have a clear next step they\'re working on and once that step is done some type of results to put out. You don\'t need to be a geological expert and fully interpret their findings. But at least have an idea of what a good finding is. They looking for gold in Canada? What\'s a good percentage of gold to be found in a result? Is it pure gold or a gold silver copper mix (gold especially tends to have copper mixed in and copper tends to have gold mixed in. To the point sometimes a copper project ends up becoming a gold and copper project because there\'s a lot of gold there too.) If they did put out good numbers what was the size and depth of the drill hole? How much cash do they have and how much to they need to raise? This one is key because it\'ll let you know how much dilution to expect (dilution is common to fund these projects and it\'s not a bad thing as long as they\'re using the money wisely. In other words, spending it on drilling and analyzing not on the CEO bonuses which some companies do). Check their website and see if there\'s some news release you might have missed. You don\'t have to do this every day, but you should have an idea of when to look from the news. They planning to drill a new hole in the fall? Ok come fall be ready to check the website and twitter to see if there\'s an update. Also, and this is key, if you find a winner take some profits. Even good projects can fall apart for reasons One of my favorite copper explorers, who found a good patch, had a JV with a big company and was well on their way to paying out big took a 66% hit because their Alaska project lost their road permits they got under the Trump administration when the new Biden lead agency decided to remove the permits because of complaints of locals they felt were previously ignored. Now they might get that permit back and go up again, but it\'s a roadblock that came out of nowhere. And this happens in the US and Canada. Companies say they\'re all set then the local First Nation people in Canada decide they don\'t like the mine, or they want a better deal and boom, permit is denied. These things can become nice winners fast. Going from nothing to finding something can be a nice 3-10X alone. And if they hit dear lord take some money out or you will go crazy as again this field has a high failure rate for all sorts of reasons.\n\n**So Which Company Should I Pick?**\n\nNope, sorry. I gave you channels to check out. I gave you methods to evaluate. Now you have to put this to work and decide for yourself. My suggestion, first pick a resource you\'re bullish on for whatever reason, then check out some videos talking about that resource and see if you agree. If you do, then start looking into companies. But I\'m not naming any, mostly because there\'s not a single explorer even close to the required market cap. If you could read through this small novel, you can watch a couple YouTube videos.\n\n**Final Disclaimer**\n\nRemember, I am some random dude on the internet. I\'ve shared with you what I do when evaluating exploration companies, but this is my method, and it might not be the best method.

That is something everybody struggles I get that, but many of you don’t even see that you have it or struggle with it.

How do you think the stock market works? Stock price only goes up, up, up, and only up? If that was your thought process, quit the game for some time and go back to the drawing board, and learn the basics. I swear you crayon eaters will see over 10,000% gain and still won’t sell. Do you realize what that means? No? That means you are meant to lose around 99% of your plays, you’re not meant to win with this mentality. Ever heard of the saying “slow one wins the race”? This saying is 100% true, when people try to get rich quickly they usually get too blind by quick gains and lose their heads.  \nThis brings me to **lesson #3**: learn the value of money, it is hard to get. There is a quick way to obtain some like behind wendy’s dumpster, but overall it is hard and takes a lot of effort and time. Be very careful.

I see so many posts saying that ticker **X** will reach **Y or Z** number by the end of this or that date, and you losers buy into it. Nobody knows what the future holds and if somebody says ticker **X** will reach a certain number by the end of someday, **RUN!** They don’t know what they are talking about, they talk straight out of their ass. Anything is possible in the stock market, the share price can go from $1 to $50 in a day, or can fall over 25% nobody knows what will happen, people just put their bets, which is gambling and that is a very different mindset. If you want to have steady gains and not be hit off guard, do your own research and learn more about the stock market.  \nThat brings me to **lesson #4:** Never believe what anybody says regarding the price and date of a stock, take into consideration that the future is unpredictable.

You guys are buying 0DTE FDs without any research, any considerations, and without reading the news. Your only thought process is something along these lines “I see green/red candle so I think it will remain that way” and then you go and burn your cash. Please go and learn what options are, the greeks like delta or theta, IV, etc. There are plenty of good youtube videos that explain everything in detail. Once you start applying basics and consider them like High IV, that will stop you from purchasing options and losing money even if you’re right. For example, you might see a stock price skyrocketing for days and see that options’ IV is over 300% and many of you will look at it and not think anything of it, but if you’re smart you’d walk away, accept that you missed the boat and look for another trade. This brings me to a very important **lesson #1**: **learn to walk away, do not fall into a FOMO circle jerk.**   \n **Reason #2:** You have no idea what the point of a stock market is and how to profit from the game.  \n To dumb it down Barnie style, the whole premise of a stock market is to buy shares or options for a specific price and then sell it to somebody else for more, sometimes much more. Which means **nobody here is your friend**. Sure, we can give advice, dd, or words of encouragement here and there but the second we get the chance to profit off you, we will. That is just the game, nothing personal and I have no guilt about selling you shares or options that ran up over 200% for the past 2 days because I don’t want to be the one left with a bag.

From there the blue bear channel support is at 3995 with the red bull channel support at 4032.\n\nUpside potential for the red bull channel is 4332 and blue bull channel potential downside is 3956.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08vi1njmqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e97cc83d51c1cba9007bb7ae1b4417294750a8b\n\nFutures weekly shows the same possible falling wedge with key support being the lod of 4006 to hold the rest of the week. \n\nKey resistance for the weekly is 4112 and key support is 3902.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0s3gg5nqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca1cca36dddec3caef8713f23c0dd134553b378c\n\nApple didn’t really have as dramatic of a day as SPY and they actually didn’t even gap fill completely today. And despite how many times SPY had retest hod apple never actually retested its HOD. \n\nKey support will remain at 159.8 tomorrow and if that breaks we should look for support at 158.2 and eventually gap fill at 157.64.\n\nBlue bear channel support is at 159.2 for tomorrow with the red (this is the 12 week long bull channel) being at 156.8.\n\nThere is actually besides the 12 week bull support line not a smaller bull channel like spy/ es futures has. Therefore upside potential for Apple is 166.8 for blue bull channel resistance and support of 156.8 for downside potential based on the daily trends. \n\nIf we see that 12 week bull support broken that would be a bigger omen for SPY and the markets in general. If we see big tech call that will be extremely bearish for the future. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odcyw4snqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59854a27bdb0ef1599eb3e1a86b528edd7134224\n\nApple weekly does show that same falling wedge that SPY/ ES weeklies are showing. Key support will be at the 159.8 low for that. A key support to break through is the weekly level of 161.1 from there bears will look for support at 157.5. If 161.1 support holds bulls will look for 163.7 and 166.5.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4cfxlmcoqpk91.png?width=358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb08147da117d9fcb91b63e7f25cc13df48b9168\n\nI am actually long on some this Friday and next Friday DTE apple (were ATM) puts. There are a little red right now but with the trend continuing to show weakness by Friday I do plan for these to be fairly green. My target sell for the 4dte is 157.5 and for the 11dte is 154.3.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkiom2uoqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc7e08e997756eef31c295b59553772f5ffa2612\n\nThe VIX had an interesting day today. We had a really massive gap up that was followed by the gap filling and support at 25.5 being retested. That support held perfectly and resulted in a really big bounce up for VIX EOD and a close over 26. We are not trending back in the 25.5 to 34.7 channel that we have spent the majority of 2022 in. this is another bearish omen for the markets. As long as VIX is over 25.5 I do suspect we see downside. We lose 25.5 that will be a reason for the markets to turn around. \n\nSo on Friday I mentioned while I wanted to be bearish I was skeptical. Like I had mentioned the markets need a reason to sell. And today they didn’t have a reason to sell. Almost all day we saw “buy the dip” playing out. It was clear who was in control today. However, EOD there we did see the bears take control with that $2 sell off. With the gap being filled and a rejection of key 405.2 level there could be a reason for the markets to sell off and there could be a reason markets do not want to hold anymore. The media is shifting to a really bearish narrative we haven’t seen since really February or march. This is going to be an interesting week and as long as SPY is below 405.2 resistance I favor a test of 390 support. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7y4uxzfpqpk91.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ee3749eeab0a2f9eb3b053e536cee9d4a7a4114\n\nStraight up bad day for me. Made a great trade in the morning. Got a bad bounce on a fake break down for the -13.2% loss. \n\nI trusted that a range day was building with 404 becoming resistance. I entered a put on that 1230 candle that massively broke down and regrettably broke my rules and entered with a SL. I saw how choppy markets were and “didn’t wanna get stopped out before I would get rewarded” because I was convinced we would see a massive sell off and close under 402.2 support. \n\nWell I was wrong obviously as they gap filled us and then every convincing sell off candle was just ripped back green and when we finally did sell off as I was expecting it was too late. Bad day and bad way to start the week off. No one to blame but myself. \n\nImportant thing for me here is to not over trade and to not break any more of my rules… when you take a tough loss you have to fight back organically. Don’t over trade and definitely don’t revenge trade trying to get back.\n\nYoutube will be up later.'), ('NAUTI GOLF AND EVOLVE AND TSLA??

I think the facts say yes, largely because the Apple-focused market seems so ignorant of the story of Globalstar and its technology. A few details:\n\nLast year,  based on nothing more than an (easily disprovable) rumor that APPL was planning to announce a GSAT deal as part of the iPhone 13 launch, GSAT shot from $1.43 to $2.69 in early Sept, then back down when the deal didn\'t happen.   A year later, the same story is beginning to repeat, only from everything I have dug up this time the technology is real and ready, there is lots of varied supporting evidence, and industry experts, including the top satellite analyst Tim Farrar, think the deal is real this year. \n\nSo what will happen to GSAT if a deal is announced?  Well, if last year\'s poorly sourced rumor could send GSAT up to $2.69, it seems reasonable to say a real deal with the world\'s most valuable company should send GSAT much higher.  Let\'s assume, very conservatively,  it jumps to $3.50.  Right now 9/9 $2.50 calls are selling for 11 cents.   If the deal is real and you exercise on Sept 9 for $3.50, you\'d turn 11 cents into $1,  9x your money.  Of course, the stock could go much higher than $3.50...\n\nSo what\'s the evidence this time the deal will happen?  A little history...  \n\nApple\'s has had what Bloomberg called "a top secret team working on satellite" since 2019.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-20/apple-has-top-secret-team-working-on-internet-satellites](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-20/apple-has-top-secret-team-working-on-internet-satellites)\n\nOn Feb 10, 2021, Globalstar issued a press release GLOBALSTAR’S BAND N53 IN QUALCOMM’S X65 MODEM"   ...."By having global 5G band support for n53 in Qualcomm Technologies’ 5G solutions, our potential device ecosystem expands significantly to include the most popular smartphones, laptops, tablets, automated equipment and other IoT modules."

If you were short (like I was) and did not move quickly to lock profits in you would have been left with a loss.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ik65hi602gl91.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9803f0abfd121d83e61e0a7099a9c5688c159ae\n\nSPY saw a nice bounce off of the support trendline yesterday and managed to close above yesterdays lows. This bounce was also an aggressive entry point to go long the market (at least in the short term). The next hurdle to clear is to regain the 50 day EMA. If we run up today that may be the point where we start to stall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g760ujo02gl91.png?width=2245&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19ad1c0fbae1190db6ab0988e00a1586b018a8af\n\nQQQ opened below the support trendline and fell but rallied back up into the close. We still saw a close below the trendline but with a large increase in volume this is looking positive, atleast for the short term. Out of SPY and QQQ we can see that SPY is the stronger of the two markets. If you decide to open a long position it would make more sense to use SPY rather than QQQ.\n\n**Recap on recent positions:**\n\nIn light if Thursdays market action I find myself both long and short. I am still short QQQ but opened a long position in SPY at the close. To clarify, I am scaling out of my short QQQ position and am only still holding around 7% of my original position. From the chart analysis it was clear that SPY was the stronger index.\n\n**Bringing everything together:**\n\nWe may have forgotten how fast these markets can whip but today was a clear reminder. This may be another bounce that leads to new highs or a short term blip that could lead to testing new lows. There is no way to know for sure. For now every investor has to be quick moving. Take partial profits when the opportunity present and sell quickly if a new position turns against you. The markets will eventually stabilize and return to their regularly scheduled uptrend but when that is no one know.

My targets for SPX calls are $4017 and $4120. so I will be  getting out of calls at these targets or before JPow speech whichever  comes first.  \nMy expectations are based on the chart levels below, the  market pumped on shit numbers and dumped on great numbers, the only  thing that has been consistent is the chart, they just tack on an excuse  for why the stock moved the way they wanted it to.\n\n**Watchlist for this week**\n\n* $MSFT  wins a $22B AR headset contract with the US army, I expect some more  pain in the market followed by a proper relief rally, $MSFT should run  hard on this news during the rally. I will take calls then, my target  would be the retest of the 50MA at $270.4, if the market tanks I'm  looking at $245 support as my first target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgoqlyxlz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a9ab8bd363995221a115492efeddd859fd4cf26\n\n* $AAPL  event starts on Wednesday, expected to reveal iPhone 14 among other  things, could see a run, if the market runs. we are currently right at  the 50MA on the daily and $155.6 support. if the market runs target is  $166.5 which is the 21MA, and if it tanks we will see $130 quickly\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzuwwcomz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dcc9faf7bd76b4d9db04798b92834768c9b453a\n\n* $SAVA  3M in insider buys last month by directors and the chief medical  officer, if someone knows something about whether they pass the trials  or not, it would be this guy. more importantly, insiders sell for many  reasons but buy only for one, they think the stock will go up. low float  37M and 33% of float shorted, ran to $140 last year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7mqj7jnz3m91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93cea75efe201e45fbfe83e6aaa7bf9974975e29\n\nTaking  ATM calls here for Jan20 23 might wait for a drop to $15.4 support  before an entry, but we are at 50MA on the daily, so might take a  starter there. if phase 2 final data is positive, we can expect to hit  $65 resistance at least, phase 3 data may be available in early 2023.  I'm taking my time with entries here and may go for a longer expiry.\n\nSo  if you made it this far, I'm guessing this is what have been waiting  for, this is largely under the radar, but could play out Tuesday, and  book us a big win!\n\n**Possible 10 bagger play for this week**\n\nSo  the $DWAC deadline to merge with truth social is Tuesday 09/06, if that  doesn't happen, which thanks to the SEC investigation it won't, the  stock dumps back to SPAC floor prices which is $10.\n\nNow  the reason it's not already there, is that they have shareholder vote  for an extension after market close, but they need 65% approval to get a  6-month extension. with most people unaware of this, it seems unlikely  it will happen.\n\nNot only that they  also have to put up $6m or $0.10 per share as collateral to get the  extension, which they don't get back if the merger doesn't go through.  we all know for political reasons will not go through in 6 months or  even a year.\n\nSo my play here is  $25p 9 Sep here, my thinking is that it won't pass. if it tanks to $10,  this could be a 10-bagger right there!\n\nAs  an important side note, please don't buy $10 puts, the floor price is  $10, and they will go to 0, even if the stock tanks to $10 because it  can't go below $10 (for the most part) so the market will price them as  worthless.\n\nAlright, so that's it  for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the  previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf  you have any questions let me know, non of this financial advice, check  my youtube channel, Twitter, and discord, they are free I don't sell  anything at all, and I'm getting very active across the board, all links  are in my profile.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!"), ('TSLA calls good or bad idea?', 'TSLA calls good or bad idea?[removed]'), ('Which stocks are over priced ATM.

This chart is not showing us a very bullish case at this time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uvn69geun3m91.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22282a13ee5c598975ecb28ba36f6528c6a7c0b0\n\nQQQ is looking much worse than SPY. Friday we opened back above the trendline but quickly fell below and came very close to undercutting the previous low. We are also now seeing a crossover of the 8 day and 50 day EMA, as well as a volume pickup as we sold off. At the moment QQQ is weaker than SPY so if you are interested in inverse ETFs it would be a good idea to look at those correlated to QQQ.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/emlj1kjvn3m91.png?width=2264&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1b9e5d8bbef444c835c8b13a7d6275fa66dfd3f\n\nBiotechs (IBB) are still performing relatively strong, this isn’t the best chart but considering the damage done to the rest of the market it is not as bad as it could be. It would be nice to see more buying volume come in and a retake of the 50 day EMA before considering opening a position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htmtb0dxn3m91.png?width=2272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=802f08bfd4050c92b1323775edc9f3def05eb199\n\nOil (OIL) attempted to make another run but were rejected when they approached recent highs. This could be productive if the previous lows remain intact and we don’t begin to go lower. Sideway action would allow for a longer base to form which would proved an excellent entry for a position.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uprfuy00o3m91.png?width=2271&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=896d821cb5ba08aade3a2f21f98b6849a21a0922\n\nOil services (OIH) broke out of a short base and climbed slightly before falling back into their base. We did see support on the 50 day EMA and a sharp bounce after. If we can see buying pressure come in and a break above the previous highs this may be a possible buy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4tjaj6w1o3m91.png?width=2270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9b6980daf8abf3391af45051254c8221dbcbfb3\n\nA 2x inverse ETF tracking QQQ, this means for every 1% decline on QQQ, this will gain 2%. We saw a good bounce off of the 50 day EMA and closed strong close to previous highs. If we break the previous high we could open a position. There is also the possibility of trading sideways for a few days to form a cup and handle pattern.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18ecj5z2o3m91.png?width=2277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9992e3a0fb2e9ca362f472930b521821bae2c96\n\nSDS is similar except it tracks SPY. As we said earlier QQQ is the weaker market so that would be the ideal index to short but SPY is also setting up for a short.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c8huplh4o3m91.png?width=2256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f04ba0afe764c58ed08bd60cc39d871d2173abe0\n\nUranium (URA) had several large moves with huge volume in the past two weeks. URA could also be forming a cup and handle with a buy point of $23.80. One thing I do not like about this chart is the amount of gaps between close and open. It would be very frustrating to have a profitable position and see it go negative overnight.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mnu9wu5o3m91.png?width=2243&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8594b6f5d8d3d2a58c6f116bc9a392baa7c015\n\nWith Oil increasing it makes sense Energy (XLE) would also increase. We saw a nice bounce on the 21 day EMA Thursday and would like to see a reclaim of the 8 day EMA as well. Taking out the previous high would be a safe buy point.\n\nBiotech, Oil, and inverse ETFs are the theme this week, they have survived (or thrived) from the recent selloff. The best strategy would be to buy the entire sector buy owning the ETF or look at the top holdings of each ETF and buy the stock with strong fundamentals and technicals.\n\n**Bringing it all together**:\n\nWe are at a pivot point for the general market, SPY can break the support trendline and fall lower or we can consolidate and attempt to move higher. Either way there are still opportunities to capitalize. Very few sectors or individual stocks can be classified as “strong”. If none of these setups appeal to you that is OKAY, just because the market is open for business does not mean you have to do business. The most important thing to do now is to build watchlists and maintain mental and financial capital so you are able to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves.'), ('Is AAPL Stock Currently Overpriced?', 'Is AAPL Stock Currently Overpriced?'), ('IS AAPL Currently Overpriced?', 'IS AAPL Currently Overpriced?'), ('Meta: Loss porn should be banned', 'Meta: Loss porn should be bannedOpinion: Loss screenshots are incredibly repetitive and incredibly easy to fake.

However, the bears once again took control today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9lnd67mqwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0326a22e9e8cba3398838df587977958f1f5bb55\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7zjhutbrwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b579d6bba7fdf5b988937098cc0c69ee770ac576\n\nToday we finally saw the 13 week long recovery support line from the June low/ v-bottom break on SPY. This is the same trend line we saw break last Friday on Apple. \n\nWith this trend line broken AND bears finally closing a candle below 391 support and also breaking down to 388.42 intraday today I am officially bearish. I am also bearish due to CPI and FOMC that are coming up soon. Lets talk chart technical and then end of this I will tell you why I am bearish fomc/ cpi and what position I am in because of it. \n\nSPY daily has a nice falling wedge forming right now (black solid lines) this falling wedge gives us a support tomorrow at 387.8 and a resistance of 394.1 (todays HOD). There are fairly high odds that we will see this falling wedges support broken later this week. \n\nKey resistance now will remain at 391 tomorrow as that is the major daily resistance level that we have to watch and that took 3 trading days to finally close below. \n\nWe are still trading within that red bear channel which gives support tomorrow at 382 (-2.2% from close) and gives resistance of 401.1 (+2.6%). Until we see the red bear channel resistance line broken I would hesitate to go long here on calls especially since we broke into the 380s today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1mmct0yrwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=195cc8322cde079120a0bd5769f9bd5fe0b6218c\n\nSpy weekly we did perfectly hold support on that 13 week long weekly bull support line, however, in later you see that Apple and Futures both broke this support so SPY should be to follow next. I mentioned that we should play level to level on SPY now. With the 390 level being breached and the 380s being seen for the first time since middle of July we now are set up in the current trajectory to see 360s-370s by end of September. \n\nKey support is now 390.3 on the weekly chart from there the next major support is 367.1 which is the weekly 200ema. The weekly 200ema is where we bounce aggressively off in June. \n\nKey resistance will be at 396.5 for this week followed by 402.2. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gdpc7jswam91.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0151ca831620d5e19da8910bd7671d04c862fa0b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xltmuq0twam91.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0478aaecff12d5235ed5780b50d33b56e3867f65\n\nSimilar story as you may expect with futures. We broke under 3900 today for the first time since July 19th. However, as of now the bears were unable to close under key support of 3900. We did see a break down of the 13 week long v-bottom bull support line today also. This should lead to a bearish movement going forward. \n\nKey supports to watch is 3900 -&gt; 3883 (the black solid falling wedge) -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3816.\n\nKey resistance to watch is 3925 -&gt; 3944 (black falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 4025.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yry55rktwam91.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=234a6c74d1c9e698db1b8097c81630095d430732\n\nHere is that weekly futures support line breakdown I was speaking about above. With this line being broken that is incredibly bearish longer term. With this support line being broken this gives rise to test support at 3827 and 3676 (weekly 200ema). I will be watching for futures to finally close under 3900 this week and that will be the longer term signal that 3600s are coming again. \n\nKey resistance remains at 4000 this week. Until this week breaks 4000 I will remain bearish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgqnj98uwam91.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a63a90fe98b5028461427acf0a7a283585ee0fa\n\nApple actually had a fairly bearish day today now only short term but long term. With a close below the daily 200ema for the first time since July this should be a very bearish omen for the future.\n\nKey support remains at 153.2 (falling wedge black solid lines) and then 150 (-3%) for the red bear channel support. \n\nKey resistance is 156 (black falling wedge resistance line) and then 160.3 (+3.6%) for the red bear channel resistance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q68zdctuwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7aadcbd5112f0cf39209cc80d99a01584276e45\n\nThe Apple charts weekly is actually kinda crazy to look at. When you think about the fact that Apple really has survived the best of all the stocks out there (for the most part) its natural that it has the most downside to expect too. The weekly is in a clear downward cycle that looks just like March. With this current downward channel I can expect a possibility that Apple COULD reach 120s by October on the current trajectory. \n\nWith the weekly 13 week long bull support line being broken I fully anticipate further downside on Apple the rest of the week and month. \n\nKey levels\n\n150.3 -&gt; 145.7 -&gt; 141.9 (weekly 100ema) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwr87bdvwam91.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ac7cd683b11458f7b269712835512cdb99c4dc7\n\nThe VIX continues to find support and continues to make new highs. Today we actually made a new recent high again. We backtested the 8ema support and also 25.5 support and held that. We also managed to close over key 26.8 resistance from last week. The VIX appears to be on a trajectory for 30+ which makes a lot of sense when you factor in CPI next Tuesday the 13th and FOMC in 15 days on the 21st. \n\nSpeaking of CPI and FOMC… let me tell you how I am positioned and how I am playing this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcjyz82wwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b77648d58ea96c5c1af5bc0885afb1382e7c0588\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss3rklmwwam91.png?width=913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33ebb54b816604a309c1187db84a8fd98902137a\n\nI alerted this today and here is why. This is the week before CPI and historically (you guys know I love my historic trends) there is usually a 2 days sell off prior to CPI. In the past 5 CPIs we are actually averaging a total drop of about 2.5% over the two days leading up to CPI. In addition the week before CPI (which is also next week) is averaging a intraweek drop of -2.86% through the week with two of those having a 5%+ drop. If you don’t factor in the last FOMC (the only time we were green the week before FOMC) then we are actually averaging a -4.23% drop the week prior to FOMC. \n\nWith this info you can see how it’s a pretty good odds that we are going to see a sell off EOW here and next week should be red due to the historical trend. Now here is something even more suspicious about this CPI… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grz1ir8xwam91.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5bfbfd1fe43a7d4f33266440c9b58839ce298d1\n\nHistorically the CPI forecast and consensus is released well ahead of the actual CPI reading. The last CPI I know they released CPI about 2-3 week before the physical CPI reading happened. I know in the last there were times it was released just shortly after the previous CPI also. The fact that there is no release of this CPI, the president says inflation hasn’t peaked, technically month over month CPI was 0% so it too didn’t drop just didn’t go up, all the fed members screaming inflations not peaked, and daddy JPOW himself at the Jackson hole saying inflation hasn’t peaked and rate hikes haven’t stopped… I have a feeling this consensus/ forecast has purposefully not been released yet. I think when they release it the number is going to be way higher then the previous 8.5% and when that happens markets are going to panic and we are going to see a very similar June 8th to June 13th CPI drop of 10% in 5 days. \n\nI personally believe we are seeing the bear storm forming and the eye of the hurricane is here right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0u9rbloxwam91.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a397c362a7209e670933ad81973cf1a950eaec22\n\nI opened this put today. I will hold this put until we break the red resistance of this bear market. If we test and reject the red resistance line I will average this put down. Otherwise I will let this one ride. \n\nI tactfully chose September 21st expiration as that is the FOMC meeting and my goal would be to close this either the Friday before FOMC or the day before FOMC depending on how markets have behaved and reacted to CPI. Another potential take profits are will be 370 as that will be a major support line too. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lql1vj6ywam91.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd2c6e9e945dc36b5c5b0d10b1c7eac4713cd450\n\nAfter last weeks frustration I decided to go down to about a $1000/ position with a -20% stop loss and a 20% take profit set on all orders. I also watch the stochs and whenever I see the stochs hit overbought (if im in call) or over sold (if in puts) on the 1min when im scalping I exit no matter where I am profit wise. \n\nToday was a much needed day for me mentally. The biggest change I made today though besides a slightly smaller position size was that I no longer hesitated in a play. I often found myself waiting and waiting and waiting for all the confirmations only to find I missed the bigger move. Today when I saw the setup and the trend aligned with my strategy I didn’t let fear stop me from entering. If it met my criteria I entered and it worked really well for me today.

Currently DOCU has very attractive gross margins which likely will be eroded by competition.

While this is an impressive number, it is not surprising as it sells a pure non-customized SAAS solution.

It seems that customer acquisition cost are increasing rapidly and Sales is consuming most of the FCF generated by the business\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stock based compensation (SBC)**\n\nin 2021 DOCU paid its employees ca. 245m SBC while this has increased to 350m in FY 2022. In Q1 FY23, SBC has increased to 95m which results in a minimum of 380m if Headcount &amp; compensation stays flat. However, HC has increased 25% over FY 22 so it can be expected that growth will continue and thus SBC.\n\nSBC is a helpful tool to manage cash burn for a growth company with expanding market capitalization and rising stock price. However, on declining market cap it poses additional dilutive downward pressure on stock price. \n\nExample: \n\nAt the current market cap of ca. 10bn, an annualized SBC of 500m will represent a dilution of 5%. The same SBC would have only meant a 1% dilution one year ago when the market cap was circa 50bn. Should the stock decline further towards 5bn, SBC will dilute by 10%.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWhile DOCU is as fundamentally profitable (non-GAAP) venture without debt and a robust balance sheet. Currently it is the leader in this field, however the hurdles of entry are low and competitors like MSFT could offer the product as part of their existing platform (MS Office) which would make DOCU obsolete for many customers. \n\nFurther, it seems the current pricing model where customers pay per signature seems very advantageous for DOCU as the marginal cost of each signature tends to be zero. However, it can be expected that competitors will offer flatrate models (as is customary with more mature SAAS solutions) which will put high margin pressure on DOCU.\n\nTherefor I rate this a sell. I will open a short position today as I expect this stock to trend towards a 5bn valuation which would put it at a 25 FY22 FCF multiple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Risks**:\n\nThe company is not fundamentally flawed and could convert into a profitable business if Sales and SBC cost are managed. \n\nThe company is still relatively small with 2bn revenue and may be able to recover its growth trajectory.\n\nIf growth stocks experience another rally, DOCU will certainly be one of the potential winners.'), ('Can someone help me with shorting the market trading strategies and discuss the different ways of doing so:', 'Can someone help me with shorting the market trading strategies and discuss the different ways of doing so:1.

Especially if you read my last night TA where I showed the probability that end of week and next week are red due to CPI/ FOMC (we still have no cpi consensus…).\n\nIf we break the red bear channel down I will get nervous about my 14dte puts, however, if we were to hold the blue resistance line from the 430 top I would not be as worried. There is a nice setup to have a similar trend as August 25th/ 26th with a nice 398 double top forming tomorrow. If markets are setting up similarly to the Jackson hole where they rallied into JPOW speaking only to dump like crazy intraday (he speaks at 910am) we could see a similar move tomorrow.

Intraday today and yesterday apple actually showed extreme weakness compared to the overall market and SPY. With apple only putting in a 0.93% green day compared to SPYs 1.8% green day Apple lagged most of the day. \n\nI believe part of that reason is that there was no sellers today on SPY hitting under 70mil currently with only 104% of the 30day average volume vs. Apple hitting 87mil and 127% of 30day average. Apple had a lot of sellers today. \n\nI was looking to see if Apple would close its back to back days under the daily 200ema, however, EOD it was able to pop its head over that resistance and couldn’t quite break down there. \n\nWe saw a pretty healthy rejection at 156.5 today and we will continue to look at that as resistance. \n\nKey support- 155.5 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 154 -&gt; 152.2\n\nKey resistance- 156.5 -&gt; 158.9 (red bear channel)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx4jpjoayhm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aec7b99fc4afa9d4db3561285570ef22bfa59292\n\nApples weekly chart continues to remain bearish. It shows that there is room for a potential pump as high as even 161 without breaking that bearish trend down. However, we should look for the weekly 20ema at 157 and weekly 8ema at 159.5 to be heavy resistance if we see upward movement. \n\nKey support remains at 154 and if we were to break 154 I would be looking for 150. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qo8ol5abyhm91.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=935dc72646b736e38f711f59fd84a945ab70dee9\n\nVIX had a pretty large 8.44% sell off day today on this very green market day. It still is holding the recovery channel upward with a trajectory for the 30s. Key level to watch tomorrow remains at 24.3. If that holds and they close it back over 25.5 that would put things back on track for a bigger sell off eow and next week. \n\nI will be posting my CPI breakdown post later tonight. If you read it you will see that I am overall bearish for Friday this week and the rest of next week as historically the week prior to FOMC is a big red week (with previous FOMC the only outlier). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9zgl6sbyhm91.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d786a19a712343a0021dbcbbe7e3c8b69711f84\n\nI am still holding this put and I did average it down after closing bell today.

Im not sure but if its anything like Jackon Hole the market is not going to like it. With no CPI forecast still I still forsee a bearish tone from JPOW.

It’s rumored that Apple will debut a 6.7-inch phone that is not a Pro model – meaning it will have the bigger size but not carry the higher price tag. That much-disliked notch around the front-facing camera system is also expected to go away. And Apple watchers forecast the company will ditch its cheaper, mini-sized iPhone as part of the 14 lineup.\n\nFinally, expect a potentially major upgrade to camera quality with the latest iPhones, as some Apple watchers predict the 14 lineup will be the first of the company’s flagship smartphones to shoot 8K video.\n\nIt’s not just the iPhone. Apple is rumored to be unveiling multiple new Apple Watch models at Wednesday’s event, including a higher-end Pro model aimed specifically at sports and fitness enthusiasts.\n\nApple is also reportedly planning to roll out upgraded AirPod Pros, its higher-end wireless earbuds. The AirPods line has proven to be one of Apple’s bigger breakout successes in recent years.\n\nApple’s event invites are always closely scrutinized by Apple watchers for hidden meanings This year, the invite features a night sky with a constellation of stars forming the Apple logo and the tag line: “Far out.” \n\nThis has led some to speculate there could be major camera upgrades to the iPhone, potentially allowing for better nighttime or long-distance photography. Apple, of course, has been sparse on details.\n\nWhile the iPhone 14 is expected to be front and center, some other hardware announcements are less likely.\n\nMany analysts believe Apple will wait to unveil new iPads and Mac computers at a separate event, possibly next month. Apple is also generally not expected to unveil its long-rumored and much-anticipated AR headset.\n\nApple’s stock has been a lemon this year. Shares are down more than 10% so far in 2022, and Apple is trading about 15% below the all-time high it hit in early January.\n\nBut with new iPhones set to be revealed Wednesday, will expectations for strong holiday sales — and all the subscription revenue that comes with that — be enough to turn Apple’s stock from red to green?\n\nInvestors appear to be betting that the newest batch of iPhones will lead to solid jumps in profits for Apple. \n\nAnalysts are forecasting earnings per share increases of nearly 9% for this fiscal year and about 6% for 2023, respectable returns for a company as large as Apple. The tech giant is expected to generate $392.5 billion in sales this year and Apple is the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalization of $2.5 trillion.\n\nThe company generates a huge amount of money from a new line of iPhones as existing customers upgrade and some holdouts make the switch from Android devices. Apple also rakes in big bucks from its lucrative services unit, subscriptions for iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+ and other perks for iPhone, iPad and Mac users.\n\nOne analyst thinks that more iPhone users than usual will look to get a new device following this launch. That\'s because many customers seem to have been holding on to iPhones for longer periods of time before getting upgrades. (This reporter has stubbornly kept his ancient iPhone 8 Plus, partly out of fear of losing the home button.) The release of new devices may prompt those users to finally upgrade.\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives noted in a report that Apple\'s initial order for 90 million iPhone 14 units is roughly flat compared to what it had ordered for the iPhone 13, even with "macro storm clouds building." So Apple clearly still expects its devices to sell even as consumer spending slows more broadly.\n"This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that 240 million of 1 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 3.5 years," Ives added.\nApple also benefits from the fact that it is a stock that is loved not just by individual investors but also by the giants of Wall Street.\nAccording to research from market strategists at Goldman Sachs, Apple was a top pick of both mutual funds and hedge funds as of the end of the second quarter, along with other megacap tech companies including Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\nApple is that rare beast, a stock that still is exciting enough for the growth crowd but is also attractive to value investors thanks to its reasonable price, penchant for stock buybacks to boost earnings and a steadily growing dividend.')], '2022-09-08': [('SPY Puts down 53% but expires on 9/16, should I take the loss or hold?

Now the question is why was a bearish? \n\nWell going into this week we had the attempted breakout at 430 that led to a massive sell off that led to 3 red weeks with us finally turning in a green week on SPY this week. On a technical standpoint puts made sense and calls would have been against the trend… in addition we had the CPI looming. Going into this week and going into Thursday we had no forecast and we had no consensus on CPI. With literally every single fed member, JPOW himself and heck even Biden saying “inflation has not peaked” with the massive sell off, the suspiciously long time we went with no CPI forecast/ consensus one would assume it was because they were going to predict inflation &gt;8.5% (higher then previous). However, Thursday the forecast came in at 8.1% and today the consensus also came in at 8.1%. \n\nNow that we have seen CPI come in bullish, markets have accepted the fact that we most likely will be seeing a 75bps hike no matter what CPI is and markets clearly rallying despite everything JPOW re-iterated Thursday morning… and now looking at the technical with a massive V bottom rally off 390 (after consolidation) and a break through of the 405.2 level… its pretty hard to not be bullish going into next week.\n\nAfter 405.2 broke intraday today and we held it I took a loss on my then 12dte puts I have no reason to expect a reason for us to go down. Now the only reason I remotely could expect any sort of bigger sell off to break 405.2 next week would be IF CPI comes in dogwater like 9%. If CPI comes in at 8.5% or below markets are about to shrek back to 430 if not higher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kv3ovp6xwm91.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3847b0ea297345adb8599983c311c6080d9f1b\n\nLooking at SPY daily you can see we have a very sharp and distinct V bottom using September 1st and September 7th to start the V. We have now held that support for 3 days in a row. I spoke on the fact that in the last 16 days there had only been two times that SPY had back to back green days well this is the first time since the peak at 430 that spy has put in back to back to back green days. This in my opinion is the change of tide. The bear sentiment has left the market. \n\nWe broke through that blue resistance line. This is the line using August 16th and August 26th tops. Breaking this line is saying the bear movement is over and we should be looking for the next bull run. In addition, a close back over that level resistance of 405.2 is extremely bullish especially after a failure to continue lower after breaking 390. While we could see a return back to 390 (but unlikely in current bullish sentiment and news cycle) a closure over 405.2 should lead markets to push back for a 417.3 level test. \n\nBulls managed to close this daily candle completely over the daily 8ema. Until that daily 8eam is broken we should be bullish. \n\nNow today did leave a \\~$2 gap on the daily chart that COULD be filled before we push higher. I do forsee a scenario Monday where we back fill that gap and see a little weakness going into CPI. Actually a red day Monday would give way for four green days in a row after CPI comes in positive. \n\nKey supports- 405.2 (level support) -&gt; 402.7 -&gt; 401.8 (V bottom recovery support) -&gt; 400.4 (gap fill at 400.86) -&gt; 397.8 \n\nKey resistance- 409.6 -&gt; 412 -&gt; 415.3 -&gt; 417.4 (level resistance) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6h9lved7xwm91.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06ef1280e7de67e2bacbda863a16203b9928d905\n\nLooking at SPY weekly we are have broken out of that downward channel on the weekly too. Now the one interesting thing is that SPY weekly did break through the blue June/ July recovery support line (futures and Apple also did), however, despite that being a bearish signal we rallied off of that level. \n\nI called it out earlier in the week but we are seeing a double bottom like formation at 392.2 also on the weekly and closed higher then last weeks candle which should signal upside. With a weekly close back over the daily 8ema and 100ema as long as spy holds the daily and weekly 8emas we should be bullish. \n\nKey support- 390.3\n\nKey resistance- 412.5 -&gt; 426.1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amrjf5x7xwm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa7527fb19b7fbfd22fc44dc2de49d0b11408349\n\nFutures has a similar V shaped recovery also, however, it did not break through its bear run blue resistance line as that was at 4105.

We saw the weekly also break the black bear channel too along with closing back over the 8ema and 100ema.

We did not see that v bottom recovery that futures and SPY were showing form until today. With two intraweek closed below the daily 200ema that would appear to be very bearish, however, we actually saw Apple put in quite a bit of strength today. \n\nApple failed to close over its daily 8ema but we can look for that to take place next week along with pushing for that blue bear resistance from this sell off. \n\nKey support- 156.7 (v bottom support) -&gt; 155.5 (200ema) -&gt; 154.4\n\nKey resistance- 158 -&gt; 160.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f35jp1j9xwm91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1e2b74f697ccb2e88564a611cebe0a1b248160d\n\nNow Apples weekly is where things get a little peculiar when you factor in Apples daily and SPY/ the general market and sentiment shift. \n\nThe apple chart is still holding within the downward channel from the August 15th and August 22nd weekly tops. But unless Apple opens under 156.7 and holds there the remained of the week Monday will most likely open over that level. However, we are seeing a gravestone doji weekly candle closed (the opposite of what we saw the week of August 15th) and this should signal a push green next week. \n\nKey support- 154.7 (blue bull support) -&gt; 154 -&gt; 150.3\n\nKey resistance- 156.7 (bear resistance) -&gt; 161.1 -&gt; 163.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4maeh3axwm91.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f35581154b61494d684630ebd463a800c0d84e\n\nAs I mentioned on Thursday the VIX had broken the recovery support line and has closed its 3rd consecutive candle below 25.5 With this failure to breakout to 30 and looming bullish (aka lessened fear) of CPI and FOMC coming up we should expect to see the VIX retest the 18s and 19s soon. \n\nWhere am I at now? \n\nOverall going into next week I suspect Monday to be a red day or at a minimum a consolidation day with most like a 0.5 +/- finish. While the markets do expect CPI to be bullish I would be hesitant for the markets to close a 4th green day in a row and then have that proceeded by a good CPI and see 5 green days in a row. Crazier things have happened but after 3 pretty big green days (when you think about the last month of sell off) it would not be surprising to see small decline on Monday. A retest of 405.2 and possibly even a gap fill back to 400 could be in play. \n\nFrom there I do expect now that the forecast and consensus along with the Cleveland Fed CPI all coming in below previous CPI of 8.5% that we will get a “good” CPI reading (good as in reading less than previous CPI of 8.5%). I believe this will start a rally into FOMC (the next Wednesday the 21st). From there markets will get their expected 75bps hike (remember markets don’t like the unexpected so even if bearish… if its known they handle it well) and from there we see a rally through end of September into October which takes us into the next earning season. \n\nTo be honest with CPI expected (and again assuming its good) coming down, the expected 75bps hike and really no new bearish catalysts to be had (unless someone can tell me something im missing here…) once CPI drops on Tuesday… there will be really little reason to not be playing calls into middle of October when we see the next earnings start. These earnings could be the only thing in my opinion that would take the market down but even there I don’t expect any more massive sell offs unless a new catalyst happens. \n\nMy plan-\n\nOvernight calls (small position) 3-5 strikes OTM (going to do some research this weekend on what will be the best play) Monday night into Tuesday morning (for the CPI good reading play). \n\nI will let Tuesday of CPI shake itself out… there is a chance core CPI could come in high and we could see a sell off on that but would be unlikely as long as the actual CPI is decreasing (below 8.5%).\n\nFrom there either Tuesday night (risk on) or Wednesday night (more conservative) I would consider opening some 30-45dte calls on SPY (and possibly Apple). \n\nIf you are aggressive you could open calls on Monday and let those ride also. However, you risk here being wrong about CPI and having CPI cause a major break down. \n\nNote- I will have my FOMC post up next weekend with a trade analysis and trade plan\n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall this was a GREAT week for me… honestly one of the better weeks I have had in a very long time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvghhzyaxwm91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be119a69e9517edf2668a9b6618d339f8284e9f7\n\nSo what did I change this week? I spoke on this a little in my last weeks TA but I went from about $1500-$2000/ entry down to about $700-$1000/ entry. I also over the last few weeks have found myself hesitating on entries. Essentially I would be watching my indicators and see the “perfect” setup forming and I would see what would be a great entry forming, however, I would say well don’t be early…. Be patient… and what I would end up doing is waiting for extra extra confirmation that the trend move I saw was actually happening. This would net me a great entry but I found I was missing such a large % gains because of this. Moves that shoulda easily been resulting in 15-25% gains were being capped at 3-5% gains because by time I was ready to enter the premiums had already priced the move in and the acceleration of the move was already done. This also resulted in many times that if I didn’t immediately enter I would end up red. \n\nWith a little big more aggressiveness… really pro-activeness on entries and recognizing its okay to be wrong as long as I keep a stop loss in place (definitely stuck to my -20% stop loss all week without waver) then I found myself with a much higher win rate and a much higher pay out on the wins I did bring in. This week was a really good mental week for me (and financial week). I look forward to carrying this success and strength into the rest of the month and year. \n\nAnother thing I recognized this week and was able to adapt to was the trend. While I was holding 14dte puts most of the week I did not find myself staying biased the last 3 days. I was able to play the intraday trend while having an overall bearish trend in mind. \n\nThe one thing I could have done differently this week when I look at my 14dte puts I opened after 390 broke and after we closed below 390 was to wait for extra confirmation. I could have waited one more day (which would have definitely resulted in not entering the same puts) and saw that we closed back over 390. A little bit of patience here could have resulted in not even opening that position and that also could have allowed me to more clearly see the support that and strength that 390 was putting in. I did begin middle of the week to recognized the consolidation that was taking place between 401.4 and 390, however, I would have liked to recognize that earlier. The one thing I will say though is that when Apple is known and has been historically driving the markets… when apple is continuing to push lower and look heavily bearish despite SPYs movements, its not that out of line to expect SPY to catch up to Apples momentum. However, we saw this week that the general market (non-tech) was driving this rally. \n\nIf you look at my intraday log I did open some 30dte calls on SPY and Apple near EOD today but I did decide to close them before EOD. I was going to be pro-active and let these run after the great CPI forecast and everything but I decided that with 3 green days in a row we should expect a consolidation day and possibly even a bigger red day to fill that gap before CPI starts a potential bull run. After being too aggressive with the put swings im okay with being conservative here… and if I am correct waiting 2 more days to enter calls is not going to make a big difference. The magnitude of this next potential “bear market rally” could take us up near 440-450s by middle to end of October… \n\nYoutube will be up later!'), ('What will happen to $qqq and $spy in 15 days?

We have been on a bull run for the past 10 years, and the labor markets have been very soft. Businesses were able to operate very optimal and lean because there was a macro environment that provided such stability. The Labor Participation vs Average Wages were trending inline with each over for years, Fed Rate was promoting basically free money borrowing, and CPI and PCE were predictable and stable. That all changed with COVID and as the macro economic model was thrown out the window as we  detached from fundamentals. I believe this has and will continue to effect the macro economics as we may be shifting from an environment of aggregate supply into one of aggregate demand and distribution.\n\n# Lets look at some macro economic trends \n\n[10 year, 5 year, 1 year and 6 mo TTM's, vs St Dev for those time frames.](https://preview.redd.it/d5ssk4uwkvm91.png?width=902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d62da716210dad27266653fc40ee6adfe0908540)\n\nLet's look at the facts:\n\n1. Core PCE is currently *way* above the average, for the last 6 months, averaging 4.84% which is over 2x the 10 year average bench mark. PCE measures the change in goods and services consumed households. It's much more sensitive to change in spending, however it's flaw is that it won't account for the change in behavior, only tracking change in TTM. So even if consumers switch to cheaper alternatives, we won't necessarily be impactful if overall CPI is up. You can say we are trending down, but again this number does not account for shift in behavior in spending (aka cheaper alternatives).\n2. CPI is obviously up, every knows it. Currently we are seeing it averaging about 2x the 5 and 10 year benchmarks. With PCE elevated, businesses have been pricing this in for over 6 months now\n3. Now lets look at workers. Labor participation is steady ***but*** are wages highly elevated. This means that there is sticky labor wages from inflation getting priced into the labor market. This is a problem, as reflected in PCE and CPI.\n\n**In brief, inflation appears to be sticky.**\n\n# Now let's examine the chart below from 2019 - Current.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ftslzvmjvm91.png?width=4304&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57f71de17ca61903203959a70c18c3024c44ae91\n\nFollow Labor Participation, this represents TTM Change % YtD. Compare it to Unemployment (TTM Change % YtD). This represents how strong the job market is. Compare the Labor Participation to the Average Wages now, and compare it to CPI data. This represents how much more people are making in this market, and how much it is in return sticking to core pricing in the economy. \n\nWe can now compare this information to see how the FED  uses it's lever of interest rates and how this in turn has an impact on the greater economy. There is generally a lagging effect for rate prices to hit the market, as represented in 2006, FED raises to 5% in 7/1/2006. Unemployment did not peak until late 11/1/2009, 4 months later.\n\nIf we extrapolate this out, we are most certainly in the realm for much more down movement as CPI is appearing to stick to Core PCE, which is currently about 1.75x over it's normal range. Wages to participating labor are diverging still. In other words, the economy needs to contract to shake off these inflated prices. Job market needs to get softer, wages need to drop so core PCE and CPI will deflate.\n\n# Thesis:\n\nCore PCE must return to normal ranges, currently Wages and PCE are extremely elevated, meaning the high inflation CPI is effecting and sticking to prices and spending over the long term.\n\nIn order to cage inflation, FED is going to raise it's rates aggressively to slow down economic growth. Shiller PE shows economy is already in a downturn, which has shown in the past to be a good indicator of an oncoming recession or economic shrinkage.\n\n**Let's review how the TTM change in Shiller PE**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0sfpvbaenvm91.png?width=4604&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01a9d9d9b31538730e3c83f06a780773ea22ba52\n\nIf we are to go into a recession, it will not be brief.

I already own WBD and have traded it a lot during the last few months, but at current prices I see it being a really good long term play for the next years\n\nSources :\n\nQ2 earnings release : [https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc\\_financials/2022/q2/WBD-2Q22-Earnings-Release-Final.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/WBD-2Q22-Earnings-Release-Final.pdf)\n\nQ2 Earnings presentation : [https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc\\_presentations/WBD-2Q22-Earnings-Presentation-Final.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_presentations/WBD-2Q22-Earnings-Presentation-Final.pdf)\n\nDebt Schedule:  [https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc\\_financials/2022/q2/WBD-Outstanding-Debt-as-of-June-30-2022.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/WBD-Outstanding-Debt-as-of-June-30-2022.pdf)\n\nWBD Finviz: [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBD&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBD&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)\n\nPARA Finviz: [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PARA&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PARA&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d)\n\nThis has also been posted in r/wallstreetbets and r/ValueInvesting.

I’ve worked at a forex trade desk, but never in public markets.\n\nRobinhood is regarded as one of the worst if not the worst retail brokerage firm in terms of order execution speed and quality. But it’s dopamine consuming confetti and colors have you coming back, so I’m gonna teach you how a Robinhood order works, from when you swipe to confirm to when your order is filled.\n\nAfter you swipe, your order is sent to Robinhoods order router, they checks things such as making sure you have enough money, potential dividend risk, potential credit risk, and Rho risk with certain interest rate sensitive derivatives. Then, if everything is good it gets sent out, but how depends on if it’s a derivative or equity.\n\nEquity/stock.\n\nEquity order execution depends on two different factors. Whether or not the order is a limit or market order, or if the order size is dividable by one standard lot(100shares, i’ll be using the term lot from now on), or if it’s less than a lot that’s called a odd lot.\n\nOdd lot orders are routed to a market maker only, this market maker depends on the security, time of day, and the current rate or rebate the MM is paying. Robinhood will always route to the market maker paying the highest rebate, leading to poorer executing quality, as the order will only be filled once the trade will be favorable to the market maker, not once there’s an auctionable exchange(seller and buyer). In a mixed lot order(ex 145 shares), the odd portion of the order(45s) will be routed in this manner. After hours, these orders are routed to an ATS, that is invisible to the NBBO. It will be filled by market participants on that ATS only.\n\nMoral of the story, do not use Robinhoods “invest in dollars” feature and if possible avoid trading in odd lots.\n\nIf you are trading in lots, and you set a limit order that is not rejected, your order will be sent to GlobalOTC, this is the same ATS that will fill odd lot orders after hours. There is typically OK liquidity here and only slightly worse than trading on exchange. Unlike odd lot orders, orders here are not only fulfilled by market makers, other market participants can add or take liquidity on global OTC.\n\nIf you are trading lots after hours, it WILL be routed to an exchange. The current exchange RobinHood markets is partnered with is Archipelago(ARCA). Equity orders will only be routed via Arca, Robinhood will utilize no other exchange, even if there is less liquidity or you have a better chance of being filled on another exchange.\n\nOptions -\n\nTrading options is much simpler. A lot in options is usually 10 contracts, and orders less than 10 contracts in size are usually given priority execution. \n\nIn 2020, Robinhood quietly switched in the routable exchange for round and odd lot orders from PHLX to BATS for round lots and GOTC for odd lot.\n\nMarket orders for options Will be directly routed to a market maker for execution, The exchange liquidity a market maker puts up is usually depending on the security, But AMEX is popular for Robinhood preferred MMs.\n\nDue to new rules in late 2020 option orders cannot appear off exchange and must appear in the NBBO, so even if your order is routed to GOTC, it will appear as BBO if the offer actually is best. This has led to actually less price improvement, but more transparency.\n\nThat’s all I got, many of the other free brokers operate in a similar way with changes. For example TD Ameritrade will route all lot orders to the exchange with the most volume.\n\nAll I got\n\nPositions\nSPY 420c 9/16\nQQQ 330 9/16'), ('A little tip for easy money', 'A little tip for easy moneyPut credit spreads on spy.

But news came out before market close that  the vote was delayed and the sponsor will loan them the money for an  extension causing it to pump.  \nLuckily it lost all gains the next day  PM and i still held the puts.

Then it ran, as it should have, up 8.5% where  I sold for a small 10% profit. Better than being right and selling at a  loss I guess.  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:**  Should have held longer, ran up alot more for the rest of the week up  20%+ from earnings, should have placed a stop loss and let it run\n\n**$NIO**  This was straight up a bad call, missed EPS and guidance, it ran after  market open went up 3%, sold for 20$ profit. I GOT LUCKY, this was a bad  call.  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:**  I mostly relied on sparse options flow for direction, it has a low PPS,  likely most action would have been in shares action, not options, which  were clearly selling off.\n\n**$GME**  Bought puts on Tuesday, and it just kept selling off, was up 75%ish so  had to take profits. Sold and rebought with profits after it pumped a  little for earnings. Got killed on earnings puts went to zero, earnings  missed as expected but pumped on FTX partnership  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:**  Stock has lots of supporters who buy the stock on any kind of news,  puts would have worked if they were long-term, as it should dump hard if  the market goes down.\n\n**$SPX Dump after Jpow Speech:**  We got a dump at 4017ish resistance, where i picked up puts as per plan  BUT it very quickly rebounded and kept going up till stop loss hit,  made 50% on this one.  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \\-\n\n**$DOCU:** Not much to say here, everybody was expecting a miss, but they didn't, puts went to 0  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \\-\n\n**$KR:** Beat earnings, didn't run too much even with a bullish market, made 15%, not bad  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \\-\n\n**$MFST $AAPL** Took no plays, no triggers activated\n\nOk  so now that we have last week wrapped up and behind us, This week is  going to be pretty damn exciting with CPI numbers coming out, so we have  to be prepared.\n\n# Earnings this week that I will play\n\nBut before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time\n\nHow I play earnings:\n\n* buy  shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or  the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before  earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes\n* lotto  size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go  as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don’t  go over 5% size on any earning’s play\n* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad\n\nSo now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it\n\n**Earnings**\n\n**Monday 12 Sep 22**  \nAfter Close - Oracle Corp. - $ORCL\n\n* World's largest database management company\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $1.07 &amp; Revenue $11.3B\n* Unusual Options: The $75.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 1.37 16Sep Expiry\n* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings\n* My  play: Not gonna lie I can't decide on this one, data/chart seems very  neutral, leaning more towards puts here, taking a very small position  here.\n\n**Thursday 15 Sep 22**  \nAfter Close - Adobe Inc. - $ADBE\n\n* Packaged software company\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $3.334 &amp; Revenue $4.443B\n* Unusual Options: $390.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 9.93 16Sep Expiry\n* Options pricing in a 7.5% move on earnings\n* The stock was down 14 days in a row, before getting a dead cat bounce\n* My play: 23sep 395c going with the flow here on this one, with $DOCU beat, a beat here seems likely too\n\nSo  this wraps up the earnings for this week, I bought last week this time  to avoid high premiums from IV spikes, remember lotto size only\n\n# Major Economic Events\n\nWe  are going into CPI with a VERY interesting, very bearish SPY hourly  chart. We are right at 200MA, we have a very overbought RSI, that  remained overbought all of Friday, and we have a big gap that is yet to  be filled.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yu2e5r0kw7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4de468bef8137b49220641c9fae1254d172017ae\n\nFrom  a trend point of view, we are at a very critical level. For the market  to continue its downward trend it needs to make a lower high here. If it  breaks this level, this is no longer a relief bounce and we have a  reversal on our hands.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zawal9skw7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=860d94dad89105691a6825f62e08e6de7ab14cb9\n\nFrom  a technical standpoint, everything points to sell off on CPI print. If  that is the case the game plan here are some scenarios and how to play  them:\n\n1. Good  CPI Read: We can see a sell-off all the way down to fill the gap,  cooling off the chart. Then a retest of the 200MA, trapping shorts and  triggering a squeeze. In which case our first take profit target is  401.2 at or before the gap fills on the way down.  \nAfter gap fills, We  have the 21MA between the gap fill and 200MA, if it rebounds and breaks  21MA then we should switch to calls. If it fails to break 21MA and  falls back then puts are still in play.\n2. Good  CPI Read: We can see a big sell-off Sunday overnight all the way to CPI  red on Monday AM, to reset the charts and then pump back up. In which  case we would just take calls after CPI read\n3. Bad  CPI Read: We can see a sell-off and a hard reject off 200MA like we did  in August and a free fall all the way to the 50MA, in that case, I  would place my stop above the gap fill level and move it down as we keep  falling, first take profit target at 50MA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ypdi25rlw7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed9d78bce47b5d627511f703e2533e7994739855\n\nI  don't see a scenario where we don't dump to reset the charts at the  very least, that's why I took a starter position of Sep14 SPX 3990p on  Friday. And will be religiously taking profits and managing stop losses.\n\nThe rest of the week is where it gets very tricky, why? These are the last 5 CPI reads and what happened after  \nApr. 12, 2022 (Tues) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week\n\nMay 11, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week\n\nJun. 10, 2022 (Fri) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week\n\nJul. 13, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week\n\nAug. 10, 2022 (Wed) - Pumped on CPI read day and pumped for the rest of the week\n\nAs  you can see the data is very inconclusive, as matter of fact it seems  to be alternating every month, so if this trend continues we should  reverse whatever happens on the CPI read day, for the rest week.  Offcourse this is not reliable so we won't be looking at that for  direction.\n\nLuckily since we are at  pivotal levels, I expect an overall follow-through, last 2 CPI reads  showed inflation decreasing, we are actually expecting, deflation for  august at -0.01% read and the headline read of 8.1%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezmcaaomw7n91.jpg?width=962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61c9f6ff29812f21571bef5dcf5735856bd1a7ee\n\nAt  or below these levels and 75bps is off the table completely which is  what the market has already priced in. Not only will we pump this week,  but we will also probably pump for the rest of Q4 22, as fed pivots in  Q1 23. If you see these numbers or below, you might want to get yourself  some calls, cause we are pumping hard.\n\nIf you see anything above these numbers prepare yourself for a new low this year and load up on puts. We have:\n\nMonday 09/12\n\n08:30 AM CPI/Inflation Rate Aug\n\nTuesday 09/13\n\n08:30 AM PPI Aug\n\nWednesday 09/14\n\n08:30 AM Retail Sales MoM Aug  \n08:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims MoM Aug\n\nThursday 09/15\n\n10:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment Sep\n\nI'm leaning towards a drop and pump but no need to guess here, we have our levels and plays ready.\n\n# Watchlist\n\n$NVDA  has a small gap to fill up to $149.8, if the market continues its run  on Monday this gap could fill and would take Calls at open if the market  is bullish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a0gf4zcnw7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a005e5a02a79a635794c0c264271be7b3d5fcf58\n\n$TSLA  has been going sideways for a while now and we are at a pivotal level,  should make a big move whichever way the market breaks, if sentiment is  bullish and we can break $315 expect a move to $364 quickly. If the  market is bearish, we go back quickly to 50MA, lose that and $207 is my  next target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4rfht4ow7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e3fbab9ce6729e0907fb017598756dfd6e1d8f5\n\n$UPST  is another gap fill play to $30, that's a 15% move from current prices.  Same-week calls would print hard if the market is bullish\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgex4n9pw7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c975478c955da1208546ecfae4b7b8d9ed4a873e\n\n$QQQ  if the market trend is bearish after CPI while everything will fall,  the biggest losers will be tech stocks. I will be loading QQQ puts here  if the market sentiment is bearish\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/un5q53zpw7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed553fae9411a5afbc41a538be6ff8c615479a79\n\n# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4mgcs8rw7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33f0715607953035330e7211bed0645988fbf8b5\n\n$NFLX  - This play is only valid if the market trend is bullish, we have a  $100 gap to fill from here. We have been channeling between $217 and  $249 for the last 2 months, sooner or later this gap will fill. Once we  break out of the channel, the gap could fill in 2-3 days. We have 2  scenarios for when the gap would fill, but both would require the market  trend to be bullish.\n\n1. The market is bullish starting at CPI all the way through FOMC, we can see the gap fill\n2. We get great earnings on 17Oct and gap fills\n\nIn  all cases looking at the chart, this gap is begging to get filled. This  is a 10+-bagger opportunity, but market conditions will dictate the  timing of the play.  If we dump on CPI we can revisit the play in  October.\n\nIf the market is bullish,  im getting Oct28 260c and Sep30 245c, even if doesn't gap fill, big  market run should push NFLX up alot. Risk to Reward is excellent on this  play, as long as it fulfils our criteria.\n\nAlright,  so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going  through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we  went wrong.\n\nIf you have any  questions let me know, non of this financial advice, check my youtube  channel, Twitter, and discord, they are free I don't sell anything at  all, and I'm getting very active across the board, all links are in my  profile.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!"), ('My Full Plan for this Week 09/12 (2 Earnings Plays, 1 Economic Event (CPI!!), 4 Stocks &amp; 1 Lotto 10x Play)', "My Full Plan for this Week 09/12 (2 Earnings Plays, 1 Economic Event (CPI!!), 4 Stocks &amp; 1 Lotto 10x Play)Hello ladies and gentlemen\n\nI'm ash and write detailed DD on stocks and events, so last week I published my Full plan and analysis.In this post, we will cover\n\n* Last week's plays and what I learned from them\n* This week’s Earnings\n* This Week's Major Economic Events\n* This week’s Watchlist\n* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play\n\nThere is also a video on my channel (link in my profile) going through all this, so you can check that out if you don't like reading\n\nOk so let's get this show on the road\n\nSo we had 12 Plays Last Week in chronological order as they unfold\n\n(2 No plays - 7 Wins - 3 Losses)\n\n**$SPX dump at Open:** Went exactly as planned grabbed SPX next day puts  PM, on the pump, the market opened to a huge dump, 300%+ play.  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements: -**\n\n**$SPX relief rally:** Also as expected after the dump, SPX bounced off  390.6 level and as per the plan we closed my SPX Friday calls before JPow Speech at the 4000ish level, 150%+ play  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements: -**\n\n**$DWAC** Was a little late on this one as it was 20% down in the PM already before open.

I GOT LUCKY, this was a bad call.  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** I mostly relied on sparse options flow for direction, it has a low PPS, likely most action would have been in shares action, not options, which were clearly selling off.\n\n**$GME** Bought puts on Tuesday, and it just kept selling off, was up 75%ish so had to take profits. Sold and rebought with profits after it pumped a little for earnings. Got killed on earnings puts went to zero, earnings missed as expected but pumped on FTX partnership  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** Stock has lots of supporters who buy the stock on any kind of news, puts would have worked if they were long-term, as it should dump hard if the market goes down.\n\n**$SPX Dump after Jpow Speech:** We got a dump at 4017ish resistance, where i picked up puts as per plan BUT it very quickly rebounded and kept going up till stop loss hit, made 50% on this one.  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \\-\n\n**$DOCU:** Not much to say here, everybody was expecting a miss, but they didn't, puts went to 0  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \\-\n\n**$KR:** Beat earnings, didn't run too much even with a bullish market, made 15%, not bad  \n**Lesson Learned/Improvements:** \\-\n\n**$MSFT $AAPL** Took no plays, no triggers activated\n\nOk so now that we have last week wrapped up and behind us, This week is going to be pretty damn exciting with CPI numbers coming out, so we have to be prepared.\n\n# Earnings this week that I will play\n\nBut before we go into the earnings, here is how I play earnings most of the time\n\nHow I play earnings:\n\n* buy shares whenever possible to avoid iv crush if you have a big account or the shares are cheap or buy atm options ideally 1-2 weeks before earnings to get a cheaper premium before iv spikes\n* lotto size plays, no matter how much dd you do, things don't necessarily go as expected. you can be right and still lose money. i personally don’t go over 5% size on any earning’s play\n* the name of the game is guidance, a company can beat eps and revenue and still tank if guidance is bad\n\nSo now that this is out of the way, let's dig into it\n\n**Earnings**\n\n**Monday 12 Sep 22**  \nAfter Close - Oracle Corp. - $ORCL\n\n* World's largest database management company\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $1.07 &amp; Revenue $11.3B\n* Unusual Options: The $75.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 1.37 16Sep Expiry\n* Options pricing in a 6.7% move on earnings\n* My play: Not gonna lie I can't decide on this one, data/chart seems very neutral, leaning more towards puts here, taking a very small position here.\n\n**Thursday 15 Sep 22**  \nAfter Close - Adobe Inc. - $ADBE\n\n* Packaged software company\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $3.334 &amp; Revenue $4.443B\n* Unusual Options: $390.0 strike received the highest open interest with a call-put ratio of 9.93 16Sep Expiry\n* Options pricing in a 7.5% move on earnings\n* The stock was down 14 days in a row, before getting a dead cat bounce\n* My play: 23sep 395c going with the flow here on this one, with $DOCU beat, a beat here seems likely too\n\nSo this wraps up the earnings for this week, I bought last week this time to avoid high premiums from IV spikes, remember lotto size only\n\n# Major Economic Events\n\nWe are going into CPI with a VERY interesting, very bearish SPY hourly chart. We are right at 200MA, we have a very overbought RSI, that remained overbought all of Friday, and we have a big gap that is yet to be filled.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pu4yjw5y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fa29a540e4f60fb1417966169bc801c324ecfdf\n\nFrom a trend point of view, we are at a very critical level. For the market to continue its downward trend it needs to make a lower high here. If it breaks this level, this is no longer a relief bounce and we have a reversal on our hands.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gj2r0pu6y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08f0dcede9e90b6e7e95dee8da72889f8679f952\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, everything points to sell off on CPI print. If that is the case the game plan here are some scenarios and how to play them:\n\n1. Good CPI Read: We can see a sell-off all the way down to fill the gap, cooling off the chart. Then a retest of the 200MA, trapping shorts and triggering a squeeze. In which case our first take profit target is 401.2 at or before the gap fills on the way down.After gap fills, We have the 21MA between the gap fill and 200MA, if it rebounds and breaks 21MA then we should switch to calls. If it fails to break 21MA and falls back then puts are still in play.\n2. Good CPI Read: We can see a big sell-off Sunday overnight all the way to CPI red on Monday AM, to reset the charts and then pump back up. In which case we would just take calls after CPI read\n3. Bad CPI Read: We can see a sell-off and a hard reject off 200MA like we did in August and a free fall all the way to the 50MA, in that case, I would place my stop above the gap fill level and move it down as we keep falling, first take profit target at 50MA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oosxz008y7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e362e872c975517f0b17098a1c9c456a72bf8da\n\nI don't see a scenario where we don't dump to reset the charts at the very least, that's why I took a starter position of Sep14 SPX 3990p on Friday. And will be religiously taking profits and managing stop losses.\n\nThe rest of the week is where it gets very tricky, why? These are the last 5 CPI reads and what happened afterApr. 12, 2022 (Tues) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week\n\nMay 11, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week\n\nJun. 10, 2022 (Fri) -  Dumped on CPI read day and Dumped the next week\n\nJul. 13, 2022 (Wed) - Dumped on CPI read day and Pumped for the rest of the week\n\nAug. 10, 2022 (Wed) - Pumped on CPI read day and pumped for the rest of the week\n\nAs you can see the data is very inconclusive, as matter of fact it seems to be alternating every month, so if this trend continues we should reverse whatever happens on the CPI read day, for the rest week. Offcourse this is not reliable so we won't be looking at that for direction.\n\nLuckily since we are at pivotal levels, I expect an overall follow-through, last 2 CPI reads showed inflation decreasing, we are actually expecting, deflation for august at -0.01% read and the headline read of 8.1%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6rpu4pfay7n91.jpg?width=962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9550ccaa78dcb53e08ac18bd1a7f447271d2550c\n\nAt or below these levels and 75bps is off the table completely which is what the market has already priced in. Not only will we pump this week, but we will also probably pump for the rest of Q4 22, as fed pivots in Q1 23. If you see these numbers or below, you might want to get yourself some calls, cause we are pumping hard.\n\nIf you see anything above these numbers prepare yourself for a new low this year and load up on puts. We have:\n\n**Monday 09/12**\n\n08:30 AM CPI/Inflation Rate Aug\n\n**Tuesday 09/13**\n\n08:30 AM PPI Aug\n\n**Wednesday 09/14**\n\n08:30 AM Retail Sales MoM Aug  \n08:30 AM Initial Jobless Claims MoM Aug\n\n**Thursday 09/15**\n\n10:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment Sep\n\nI'm leaning towards a drop and pump but no need to guess here, we have our levels and plays ready.\n\n# Watchlist\n\n**$NVDA** has a small gap to fill up to $149.8, if the market continues its run on Monday this gap could fill and would take Calls at open if the market is bullish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcw2djfcy7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51cfd2ae890782af83646dc37af1807a10ccab08\n\n**$TSLA** has been going sideways for a while now and we are at a pivotal level, should make a big move whichever way the market breaks, if sentiment is bullish and we can break $315 expect a move to $364 quickly. If the market is bearish, we go back quickly to 50MA, lose that and $207 is my next target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aq0zbuady7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=360ce4bd6b83a37d3c174c140135fa6141854930\n\n**$UPST** is another gap fill play to $30, that's a 15% move from current prices. Same-week calls would print hard if the market is bullish\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujxh8m6ey7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f70bfe2292752888cf3f7b904322fbaac87807\n\n**$QQQ** if the market trend is bearish after CPI while everything will fall, the biggest losers will be tech stocks. I will be loading QQQ puts here if the market sentiment is bearish\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkqz99xey7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6738acf2da414a7382de7c54aadaa97540ba9ab\n\n# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play\n\n  \n**$NFLX -** This play is only valid if the market trend is bullish, we have a $100 gap to fill from here. We have been channeling between $217 and $249 for the last 2 months, sooner or later this gap will fill. Once we break out of the channel, the gap could fill in 2-3 days. We have 2 scenarios for when the gap would fill, but both would require the market trend to be bullish.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1i6s9fgy7n91.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1406fe8ebea6c658e3baf944283f9791c14a2936\n\n1. The market is bullish starting at CPI all the way through FOMC, we can see the gap fill\n2. We get great earnings on 17Oct and gap fills\n\nIn all cases looking at the chart, this gap is begging to get filled. This is a 10+-bagger opportunity, but market conditions will dictate the timing of the play.  If we dump on CPI we can revisit the play in October.\n\nIf the market is bullish, im getting Oct28 260c and Sep30 245c, even if doesn't gap fill, big market run should push NFLX up alot. Risk to Reward is excellent on this play, as long as it fulfils our criteria.\n\nAlright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know, non of this financial advice, check my youtube channel, Twitter, and discord, they are free I don't sell anything at all, and I'm getting very active across the board, all links are in my profile.\n\nI wish you all a very green week!"), ('Inflation expectations are quickly lowering.

Overall a really tough day to trade. Not only that but the VIX was rising most of the day (which to be expected with CPI tomorrow) and Apple hit 4.3%+ at one point and while Apple was going for ATH it seemed like SPY struggled almost all day. Definitely an interesting disconnected day. I traded until about 1130 and after that I refused to touch it. I didn’t really see any of my idea trade setups today either with the chop and random little dumps SPY would have. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6gm9s8oohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de4a100d5d0f18425d5532fa13a93c9bd7bf13f0\n\nI am going to keep this TA super short and simple and to the point.. why? Well because in the end while technical 100% matter and eventually tomorrow regardless of a big dump or a big pop SPY will find a key level to hug to but until then its just a guess. So lets look at some bigger “targets.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryn3jouoohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a30c097f2c88154cd936ba0ec57036828e36fda4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2inf6sbpohn91.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6749b63c754a441c8e10040838425b25fd530c3f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4qxo4spohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea44b7bbf448776fbe75bf9357bbabed4576f2eb\n\nCurrently credit Suisse released a report that they think CPI will be 7.9% and forecast/ consensus is 8.1% and Cleveland fed CPI nowcast which is usually pretty close is predicting 8.22%. Overall we should expect to see CPI hit that 7.9 to 8.2% range tomorrow in my opinion. \n\nSo If we get a bullish CPI reading tomorrow then most likely we will see a big green open. The biggest openings we usually have from CPI at 1.4 to 1.8%. So on average we can say a 1.5% +/- opening regardless of reading. \n\nSo if we get a good CPI reading tomorrow we should expect an opening closer to 417. Which would be pretty huge as this would put us right at key 417.3 level resistance. From there that will be a big fight that rages on. \n\nIf we break through that resistance then we should look for 421.22 gap fill.  \n\nHowever, if we get a bad CPI and expect a -1.5% opening we could see 404.8. This would be significant as it would put us back below key level support if 405.3.\n\nBreaking below key 405.3 we could attempt a gap fill down to 400.86. \n\nOverall we can expect high volatility and a good CPI or a bad CPI in my opinion will guide the markets for the next week until FOMC..\n\nIts hard to give a sold TA based prediction here but in my opinion good cpi + 75bps hike= rally…. Bad cpi and 75bps= rally… bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump… bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvgblhfqohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa99af561852e2fa49270a64b8cbf6f7ba2448cc\n\nApple was an absolutely wild child today! Putting in the biggest green day its had since May 27th which was a 4%+ day. \n\nApple also put in a heavy volume day today hitting 149% of its 30day average by close and 125% of its 10day average intraday range. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xj8z7fzqohn91.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40da90dd9d02347a8add0707a0978358cf21cbb8\n\nApple broke through that major resistance from the early august top and that should continue to open up the upside for Apple and the rest of the market as long as CPI comes in strong tomorrow. \n\nWe should expect a solid 3% +/- from Apple tomorrow with a possible range of 168.3 to 158.5. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akxpttfrohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=058f3fc646571020e4edbad0d48400a53469ce8c\n\nNot surprisingly we did see a small green day on the VIX today despite SPY in sell off mode.

That's why Zucker is investing so heavily into VR. He's not targeting teens or adults. He targeting kids and the next generation of people who will be accessing the internet. Just look at TikTok. People use to bash it but it's one of the popular social media platform now because the newer gen kids (teens etc etc) are using it.\n\nWhrther Facebook (meta) investors and it's cash flow can survive long enough to make it a trending platform is to be seen but it's a long play.

Inflation had peaked per CPI as I expected coming in a 8.3% vs. 8.5% previous, however, market honed in on year over year and month over month core. Year over year core had not gone up since April this year. I took a calculated risk with the information I had and honestly with what I knew then I woulda made the same play. Win some you lose some… this is why plays like that should be small in size. \n\nThe worst part is prior to the bullish pop last week in the market I was bearish going into the CPI meeting and was expecting a dump. Got shaken out and bull trapped with the lower then expected consensus and forecast… the psyops continue. \n\nAnyways moving on! Today was the worst day in the markets since the June 2020 the Covid crash. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z8ca3rwxton91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20b6b89d6dd6357eb10e8d20f17713b689d29071\n\nToday was the 5th largest daily point loss in the whole history of the S&amp;p500. \n\nSo lets take a second and lets think about WHY we sold off so aggressively. \n\nGoing into today markets knew (it was bout a 91% chance) that we would get a 75bps hike and they THOUGHT that inflation would peak. This morning markets realized inflation did not peak (per core), the 75bps rate hike might not be enough to fight inflation so a 100bps hike could be needed, and they are also accepting more and more that a soft landing is not going to happen. \n\nMarkets are not in a rock and a hard place. They were previously rallying on news that few were going to pivot (July to august run) and then Jackson hole slapped markets to reality that was not going to happen. However, markets were feeling pretty bullish going into this CPI. Now that markets realize there is nothing to be bullish about this is where things get interesting. \n\nIs this the start of a capitulation like sell off we saw in June around that CPI (remember it dropped 10.3% in 3 days) or was this a massive market over-reaction to a potential 100bps rate hike that was not even mentioned to begin with? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xg2fd3fyton91.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff1a3b52ce9ad7e5c32a7d777b5deb92997d8066\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olcyivwyton91.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d107a4730e71ec34fe9c097aabec05a8b4af2fef\n\nToday we broke down and opened below the 405.2 daily resistance level and didn’t quite make it to that 390 level. We have not broken back below the red dotted support line using the June low and sept 6th low for support. \n\nWe are looking at a potential blue bear channel which gives EOW support near 380 (-3.4%) or the black bear channel which gives a deeper sell off of 362 (-8%). \n\nThe one thing that is for sure is that we broke through the v shaped recovery support and the next major support test comes at 390.5. This is where I suspect if the bulls are going to put up a fight that it happens. However, if we are to close a candle in the 380s tomorrow or later this week then it would appear we could be in a bigger sell off until FOMC. \n\nKey supports tomorrow- 391.1 -&gt; 390.5 -&gt; 388.5 -&gt; 386.8 -&gt; 382 -&gt; 368.3\n\nKey resistance tomorrow- 395.3 -&gt; 400.4 -&gt; 402\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp1ysjgzton91.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f47e77e7e570fe7b04635df99b4084d825b8e14\n\nSPY weekly is starting to show more and more of this current black weekly downward channel.

The biggest take away on Apple is that it did break through its red dotted support line from the June recovery. In addition it closed back below the daily 200ema and closed lower then any of the candles last week during the sell off. \n\nBlack bear support line comes in at 139 and blue bear support comes in at 148 for the EOW potential targets. \n\nKey supports tomorrow- 151.5 -&gt; 148.7 -&gt; 149.4 -&gt; 147\n\nKey resistance tomorrow- 157.4 -&gt; 159.9\n\nUnlike SPY (thanks to apples huge 4% day yesterday) there is no gap left on the daily chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1y0t7km1uon91.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61cb2a0add86a0d1831cc3cbc85a4e61cd0967d3\n\nIn terms of bearish and clean looking charts this apple weakly chart does look extremely clear in what trend we are clearly in with a break in the weekly support line. \n\nKey support- 150.2 -&gt; 148.8\n\nKey resistance- 157.5 -&gt; 161\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgw37j52uon91.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc2c9cdbbe1cb56c3092a22a940fcef3ce2d07ca\n\nThe VIX is where things are going to get a little interesting. You can see how many times we have found ourselves over this 26.9 level but unable to push any higher. There is an obvious reason to suspect we are still in a bullish channel up on the VIX, however, previous to today that channel was breaking down and we were trending clearly back under 25.5. \n\nWhile a 14.33% green move on the VIX is big when we look at other VIX days from this year we have plenty of 20%+ moves on the VIX. There was even part of the day today where the vix showed weakness and had even broke back below 25.5 before the EOD push up on the VIX and down on SPY.\n\nKey level to watch tomorrow for the VIX is 28.3 and 26.8. I am wondering with how disconnect the VIX has been from reality and the markets since really the June lows if we could see a major sell off on the markets without getting the vix back to 35-40. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsm9kmr2uon91.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ec8177b4bd3ed9c28b51d011ea2b9512800f799\n\nYes my call was worthless… yes it sucked.

The one thing that is for sure is that 390-392 is one big wall that markets are not quite ready to see fail yet. \n\nKey support tomorrow will remain at 393 -&gt; 391 -&gt; 390.4 -&gt; 388.6 -&gt; 386.4. \n\nKey resistance tomorrow will remain at 395.4 -&gt; 397.8 -&gt; 400.5 à 401.9.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/csg0tqu0lwn91.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71203682e6b2993d8dbde6e992c1f26e03fd2851\n\nWith this consolidation day not much has changed daily and weekly level wise. We still hold key support at 390 for the weekly and key resistance at 412.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5cxn9a1lwn91.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=734d7ec9b02a98752f82e4020e8e8dd370a08f35\n\nOften times I look to ES futures for any hints of what might be to come on SPY, however, the charts are fairly mirror images with no new data to trade off of.\n\nKey support- 3956 -&gt; 3930 -&gt; 3910 -&gt; 3868\n\nKey resistance- 3980 -&gt; 4005 -&gt; 4030 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6bssh0v1lwn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6d91b61db8c781ff7cb9558ac631a96580d4d3\n\nKey weekly resistance remains at 4160 and key support at 3900.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8luvzfj2lwn91.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1df2319738f556a82517a689fae7220e6fa6efd9\n\nApple yet again today spent time trading under and over its daily 200ema now closing its 2nd day in a row below the daily 200ema. This is the first time there has been back to back candles closed below the daily 200ema since May. \n\nMajor support is being established at this 153.8 to 154.5 level and major resistance is starting to form at 157.4. Today I did play a few plays based off the bounces here on support and resistance. Apple actually was a much better trade most of the day then SPY was. I was tempted to dabble in some tesla plays today too but withheld the temptation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zht0gd93lwn91.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a2c97d91cfbaaf139daf12f3a87ae4715e301cb\n\nThe VIX did a whole lot of nothing today seeing a mild decline and closing back below that key 26.9 level. The VIX is not going to work its way back down to test 25.5.. a break and closure below 25.5 would signal a potential bottom. \n\nFor me while the VIX really has been disconnected from reality… I would not be positioning myself too long or too aggressively short until the VIX breaks and closes of 28. I also struggle going long on calls while VIX is over 25.5. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwjsilr3lwn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c9208d5289944009b9d92b213ddc1956e07d80b\n\nSo something to keep in mind that is happening this Friday is that it is Quad witching day. Ironically the last quad witching day on June 17th was the bottom and the low of the year so far. While the day itself was uneventful and pretty much just chopped all day and ranged it did put in a bottom and cause one heck of an impressive rally. \n\nIf we look at March 18th quad witching day that also happens to coincide with a pretty impressive rally. Is it possible that Friday will be the “bottom” and we see a rally develop? \n\nIf we think about it while the markets yesterday realized how screwed we are long term the fact that we did not dump today says a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrkpf5d4lwn91.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e61ace70c012ad712b4f863131ee8e2574d11a8\n\nInterestingly enough last night and at open today there was a 30-33% chance of a 100bps hike at the meeting on Sept 21st. However, you can see that the % chance has already declined to 25%. \n\nThere is potential markets hella over-reacted thinking we get a 100bps hike, we consolidate in this 390-405 range until FOMC and when we do get the 75bps hike markets see a bit of a relief rally. There is no FOMC until November so there would be no more fear in the markets and the fear of a 100bps at next meeting wouldn’t really be a factor until next months CPI. \n\nRemember it is 100x harder for markets to sell off like yesterday and 100x more natural for market to trend up then down. Markets NEED a reason to sell… the question now is what is the reason… And what is that potential next catalyst you may ask? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oyh7bkt4lwn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=176801e0de961d7f0dea72c15a3cdd137609bd41\n\nCurrently there is a railroad strike that tomorrow would be the last day to “settle” it before Fridays cooling off strike period ends and we may see a world of hurt start. \n\nI feel like a lot of people fail to realize just how much cargo and liquids are transported by rail still in our country. This strike could potentially cause inflation and supply chain issues to get even worse than they already are. The markets very much so could negatively react to this. There were some sell offs today on news but so far the algos haven’t hooked up on much yet. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f2ujfa5lwn91.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dc78bb17f125b95058c7ca5e0f6b70cc9532f6e\n\nI had a really great day trading. I actually did the first 4 trades within the first hour of the markets opening which is not common for me. But lately the first hour has been really nice movements and technical and then the rest of the day much like today was just choppy trash not worth trading. \n\nI also played a few Apple options todays too. Apple as I mentioned above actually has been looking much smoother and better to trade then SPY has lately. I will look to continue to capitalize on Apple. \n\nGood day for me today hope you guys had a good day too. \n\nYoutube video will be up later!'), ('TSLA saving my Portfolio through this depression!', 'TSLA saving my Portfolio through this depression!'), ('First Tenbagger+ gain 1000% $1.8k &gt; $21k on SPY PUTS today', 'First Tenbagger+ gain 1000% $1.8k &gt; $21k on SPY PUTS today'), ('Honest opinions on SPY outlook', 'Honest opinions on SPY outlook[removed]'), ('SPY - The Most Important Trend Line to Watch 👀 9/14 update', 'SPY - The Most Important Trend Line to Watch 👀 9/14 update&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2022 support &amp; resistance](https://preview.redd.it/mtv0kogdtvn91.png?width=2378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b7e3a7b44f8070904ef6a5febd9a885b8386ff7)\n\nFollowing up [yesterday\'s post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xdmkex/spy_the_most_important_trend_line_to_watch/).

Unlike other fake messiahs like RC, Elon has literally risked his career supporting our giddy adventures. Love it or hate it, Tesla RIPS. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However I’m thinking about a few things:\n\nPresidential cycles: \n\n(formatted weird due to some rules)\n\nFor like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year.\n\nTesla’s trend:\n\nAbsolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, I’m doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD.\n\nNOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY:\n\nIt really isn’t. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elon’s commitment to R&amp;D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, it’s just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I don’t expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but I’d rather bet on the company with the biggest head start.\n\nElon Musk:\n\nYou gotta love him. He’s helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And he’s an absolute savage. I’m also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as he’s already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors.\n\nTLDR: Why the fuck haven’t we rallied behind Elon more. He literally risks his career by tweeting and supporting our antics. RC is a fraud and some of you still support him?! If you don’t like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk.

Although the initial Fisker vehicles likely won\'t qualify for US tax incentives, demand remains strong both in the US and European markets, and long term plans include US production of future models.\n\nPersonally, near term I am expecting FSR to rise a bit on rumors as we approach production in November, after which the initial reception of the vehicles will probably predict the price action going forward. **My current positions** are 225 calls and 60 calendar spreads targeting a near term (@60dte) price action in the $11-$14 range, with leaps for 2024 starting at $15.

Lets set the scene here… \n\nThe last time we had 5 red days in a row was July 8th to July 14th where SPY dropped from 390.64 to 371.04. The 6th day was a huge 1.91% green day. Before that was the June CPI/ FOMC drop where we put 5 red days in a row with a drop from 415.82 to 370.59. There was one green day (fomc) of 1.43% then we had 2 more red days down to 362.17. From there we saw a bigger pop of 3 of 4 days being green and going from 362.17 to 390.09. There has not been an instance of 6 red days in a row on SPY since Feb 2020. \n\nWe have to ask ourselves are we in the same level of turmoil as Feb 2020? I would say no we are not. But we are clearly in a pretty bearish period of time in the markets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9t02og5dj9q91.png?width=844&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f32fa0e1647668cf9ebcc2fa89479db2e6f2ecf\n\nGot a lot going on the daily chart but let me explain. I had mentioned the similarities for June 8th to June 17th on the SPY chart and this daily candle close today just made it even more similar. On June 16th we put in a candle of 370.94 to 364.08 followed be a 369.38 to 362.17 candle (that would be two back to back candles with a slightly lower high and a slightly lower low). Friday was 370.62 to 363.29 and today was 370.21 to 363.03… the exact same thing.\n\nThis to me could be a very large double bottom forming on SPY. Now only that but that June 17th low as I mentioned came after a 7 out of 8 red day stretch and SPY currently just put in its 8th red day out of the last 10 trading days. If spy is going to bounce its here… and if its not going to bounce the massive face melting dump is about to begin… Failure for SPY to make a new low for the year twice now sends a pretty big message especially with these large EOD intraday v bottoms we are seeing. Todays price action brought spy to the 75% retracement of the 2022 bear channel also. \n\nMy anticipation here after 5 red days in a row is that we are going to see a large green day tomorrow and most likely will close over 370.6 resistance. From there I would anticipate a move back to 380-390 by end of week much like we saw at the June low. \n\nKey support- 362.2 -&gt;358.1 \n\nKey resistance- 366.5 -&gt; 370.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp6xmgmdj9q91.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f8e673f7db55404f408fa31c0f265cec5efedb8\n\nFutures is looking to close it lowest candle of the year currently.

Apple and overall tech today held up much better then SPY. What I am seeing which is the same as last week is that this is not a NASDAQ driven sell off.

I mentioned last week I forsaw after the 312 rejection a possible head and shoulders forming with a target of 222-250 (blue arrows for visual). However, looking at the smaller red arrows we actually are forming a possible bullish 270.3 support bounce with a possible target of retesting that 312 level again. \n\nIf tesla closes below 270.3 on the daily chart then I would look for the bigger sell off to play out. However, as long as we are holding support here at 270.3 there is a play on calls to 300-312.\n\nKey support- 270.3 -&gt; 251.2\n\nKey resistance- 283.7 -&gt; 291.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2xaznofj9q91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0be12b8322a23aecc1808ee37f29b8400c2275ff\n\nThe VIX was again on a pretty big mission today and saw a ton of intraday volatility. The one thing I am seeing here is that the VIX still has not broken that black dotted resistance line from the Jan 24 and May 2nd highs… Until that line is broken and until we see SPY break 362.17 (low of year) I am under the impression we hold support here. The VIX really has struggled to stay over 32 barely closing over it today. If the VIX breaks over 33.1 tomorrow and especially over 33.7 tomorrow I would be looking for a bigger sell off on SPY to take place. However, we may see the vix unwind and close back under 29.7 tomorrow which further points to a bigger green day tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/70yqwg7gj9q91.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee7f459afb6f2c20ad0026fea59a9201221f19ef\n\nOverall had a really great day today and the server as a whole had a great day!

I had opened them at market open today. If my thesis holds true these will be itm tomorrow and green. I would like to close them tomorrow if possible but would consider holding till Wednesday if it looks like we are pushing. My first target for selling is the 373.44 gap fill (2.5% from close).

Kinda crazy to think we have had 6 red days in a row for the first time in 2.5 years yet we have only fallen half the distance that the covid crash saw. However, since August 16th (30 trading days) we have seen a total drop of 16.5%... falling just a few % short of the March 29th to May 20th 17.7% sell off over 38 days before we finally saw a meaningful bounce. With SPY officially putting a new low of year in here, the VIX making a new higher high (breaking the downward trend started in January) its hard to be bullish here especially with from what I have seen besides the CPI -4.35% red day I haven’t felt “capitulation” or that fear pumping scary that the bottoms never coming sell off. \n\nCNBC on Friday mentioned that historically this is the “worst week of the year for stocks” with the weekly only being down -1.24% total currently… and some -5% to -6% red weeks to compete with… I wonder how this week is going to finish out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkfhdtxyahq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22112a516715d92cf1c159a93a57b3a5e9bfbea5\n\nLooking at SPY weekly here we have the black downward channel still intact, we have a blue falling wedge forming and we also have a red falling wedge forming inside of that falling wedge. \n\nThe one thing that I am really seeing here though is that the red horizontal channel with resistance at 370.6 was broken underneath on September 23rd and we have now rejected that resistance 3 days in a row and made a new lower low each day. I am actually a little surprised that when we made a new official low for the year that we didn’t just see a face melting dump. We consolidated for almost 3 hours around that 362 level. I do wonder if we are about to see that level broken and see the 350s for the first time since November 2020 tomorrow. Despite the now 6 red days in a row… I have a hard time being bullish while SPY rejects 370 and make a new low for the last 11 days straight. \n\nSupport- 362.1 -&gt; 360.2 (red support) -&gt; 358.2 (blue support) -&gt; 355.4 -&gt; 352.3\n\nResistance- 364.3 -&gt; 365.6 (red resistance) -&gt; 368.2 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 373.7 (blue resistance and gap fill) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31g6d9hzahq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b228a328b8a341912e0b7d350cedd73b32f1b9\n\nTaking a look at futures we are seeing a fairly similar pattern with the black bear channel and the blue falling wedge. I have highlighted two arrows (in blue) where we could be at. Looking at the trend of two days of sell candles followed by a gravestone doji we could be starting a two day bigger sell off tomorrow. Looking at trends generally when a gravestone doji like todays candle pops up on a downward sell off it usually leads to a continuation not a reversal. I do suspect further downside. I would be bearish based off futures as long as we are making lower lows, closing lower lows and as long as we hold under 3770. \n\nKey support- 3635 -&gt; 3615 (blue support) -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3545\n\nKey resistance- 3670 -&gt; 3706 (blue resistance) -&gt; 3770\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mul8f900bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=381e87f542780f0db41d5345bedf97b0f419ed3c\n\nLooking at apple this morning once again… which has been trend for the last week… we have seen nothing but strength from apple and tech overall. Today however, we did see weakness in the tech side of things with the exception of Apple, Tesla and Nvidia. However despite an early morning breakout attempt we saw weakness end of day and did see apple even flash red momentarily. With a break of that potential V bottom support we should be looking at further downside. \n\nI was as I called out yesterday (before VIX rocketed and SPY made a new lower low) that we would see a potential breakout with a inverse head and shoulders. AS of now that is technically still intact, however, if Apple loses 149.2 that will negate the pattern. With Apple attempting to break out, closing its 4th doji daily candle in a row, and failing to close over its daily 8ema 3 days in a row I would suspect downside to come. \n\nThe thing I am waiting for now that SPY put in a new low is for the tech sell off. SPY is at the 75% retracement of its 2022 bear channel with apple still holding at 50% retracement along with Tesla. Tech is in far better shape then the general stock market and SPY. We have seen a NYSE driven sell off for the last week. The reason in my opinion we haven’t hit capitulation and we haven’t been seeing 3-4%+ sell offs is because people have not abandoned their tech positions yet. If and when tech finally loses support and loses its buy pressure that is when SPY will put the bottom in and that is when we see the worse week in market history play out. As long as Apple and tech in general hold semi bullish… this is likely to be a slow burn sell off. \n\nKey supports- 150.7 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 147.1\n\nKey resistance- 152.4 -&gt; 154.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rabr1ak0bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421f0e076579dbbf7cccfc8a56f8f154fa23a45e\n\nTesla is another one that I was expecting could see a bigger breakout despite a looming downward pattern. With the rejection at daily 8ema and rejecting/ closing below 283.9. I suspect with that big 4 day sell off last week followed by now a 2 day dead cat bounce is about to see its next leg down. Which if Tesla truly is on its next leg down here that means tech could be the catalyst of doom for SPY and the markets. \n\nTesla actually had a ton of movement today with a total of $11.16. Being up almost 4.5% and down the lowest I saw a +0.7% closing up 2.51% may seem like a victory for the tesla bulls, however, to me this showed weakness. I will be keeping an eye on that 283.8 resistance tomorrow. As long as Tesla holds below that I am bearish. Once and If we break through 270.3 support I think that will trigger that bigger sell off I was alluding to. \n\nSupport- 270.3 -&gt; 264.4 (50% retracement/ black falling wedge support) \n\nResistance- 283.8 (falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 292\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gasyw21bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6448fd81850b4f6eed3e8b5f0f007ea3619718d7\n\nJust when I finally said it was time to give up on the VIX and it was no longer pertinent to my everyday trading… it goes and makes itself important again. Today actually was an extreme bearish day overall technical wise. Not only did SPY put in a new lower low for the year we saw the VIX break its black dotted bear channel resistance line that dates back to January 24th 2022. This means the trend of the VIX continuously making lower lows has been broken. The VIX is now pushing higher and higher. Many people have been saying true bottom is not in until we see the VIX hit 40-50… I am not saying that is what is going to happen but this is the highest the VIX has been since the June 16th previous low. The question now is will the VIX attempt to make a 52week high (38.94) tomorrow, or is the VIX reaching max fear levels and much like January, March, May and June when the VIX breached 33.7 the top was in.\n\nI am pretty indifferent here. On one hand historically speaking for 2022 making a new low on SPY, and VIX breaking 33.7 is a time that we should consider going long on some Calls. However, I haven’t really seen that big flip back to bullish sentiment, and we have not seen tech catch up (more like drop down) to the sell of intensity that SPY is experiencing. \n\nThe next few days are going to be interesting on SPY and you can expect with the VIX over 32 again for high volatility and unpredictability. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqhagwr1bhq91.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccfb99337d2ece731e9d1ada0d441082a2798fec\n\nYou know honestly not my best day today… I had some 1dte and 3dte calls that were hella red overnight that I swung. Was able to close the 3dte naturally for a nice win at open and then a quick average down at open got me to breakeven on the 1dte calls. \n\nFrom there it was downhill for a little while. I was still under the impression that we were going to be seeing a green close today and I was also under the impression that the bottom was in and that we were going to take 370 out finally. I was very wrong. Thankfully EOD I was able to get on board and able to close out a decent week day. \n\nThis is one of those days where being TOO biased to start the days and being “smarter” than the markets can really hurt you. The best thing I did today was having hard stop loss price targets for my calls. I was able to recognize I COULD be wrong and that if I WAS wrong it was time to GTFO before a manageable loser became an unmanageable loser. \n\nI am very indifferent where markets are going to go from here. On one hand I really do think we could see the 340s-350s this week and on the other hand we are hitting some extreme levels on SPY and the VIX and we very well could have just put the bottom in. I really don’t know where to go from here… but that’s why when in doubt we don’t swing and why for the most part I recommend intraday plays. \n\nOverall I think as long as tech holds support (Apple closing over 149.2 and Tesla over 270.1) it is hard for me to be full bear. But in a market as volatile and vulnerable as now anything can happen overnight. \n\nYoutube video be up later tonight\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uag90dc2bhq91.png?width=967&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c06102d15361ce3a98c6c2e79dcaf9c8dbd90a4c'), ('15k loan to 53k spy yolo.

The first thing I want to touch on is the daily range of SPY today. Lets take a look \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7n48fhiprur91.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1002362aaa2287d0547940f94dd8d1aef1d228f8\n\nAccording to the data that brokers supply us… SPY saw a range of $11.43 with a LOD of 366.57 and a HOD of 377.66, however, SPYs actual LOD is 372.31 and a range of $5.69. So what does this mean? Well the last times this happened I coined it the “phantom range” and everytime it has happened the price of SPY has hit that level either intraday or the next day. This most likely is dark pool prints. \n\nToday was also extremely interesting when we look at the buy pressure, and TRIN. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcapwwxprur91.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e5dc94bc25c3d7a7ca6e9a840e1412bbf4c1cf\n\nLeft side is todays market data which shows that we had a legit buy pressure of almost 2500:1 on SPY this morning and our trin was 0.21 (extreme imbalanced). Then we take a look at yesterday and our buy pressure on that massive run up was 9.72 and our TRIN was 5.05 (also hella imbalanced). \n\nThis is officially the biggest two day rally that SPY has had all year and is the biggest two day rally since April 2020… so what comes next? \n\nWell lets look at WHY the market is even rallying like this… the CNBC current news cycle is set on repeat of “the fed is going to pivot, December is likely the last rate hike…” is this true? No most likely not… JPOW was very clear that we would NOT see a pivot or rate pauses until 2024 most likely. But with BOE and now Austria slowing its rate hikes/ starting QE… markets are rallying on this news. \n\nThere is a chance we are about to go on a massive rally for the next 2 months till the November rate hike and JPOW finally talks again. That or we are seeing an extreme bear market dead cat bounce and the shows about to come to and end soon. Most of the bear market bounces this year are around $20 for low to high… we from Fridays low at $20.96. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eoefi5fqrur91.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7b12d0ed958d1707c38d02a8dc30dc7f4e8775\n\nOkay here is the above chart with less lines to make it clear on what im trying to show… We are looking like we are in a pattern just like the March to may sell off followed by an aggressive rally that led to consolidation and then a bigger dump (when CPI hit). I wonder if this pattern is about to play out again. That dump was a bounce form the 75% retracement to the 50% retracement… consolidation then dump to the 2022 bear channel support (around 330-340 depending on timing). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pl1q2xqrur91.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ce5cf94e8207fc4a517888cbb9e379cba0e4c05\n\nToday we saw SPY with a massive gap up (however, due to the phantom print this gap is now covered) over the daily 8ema and we stopped right at the 20ema. Most of these dead cat bounces have also stopped at the daily 20ema. So we are at a major pivot point here. \n\nThere was on the 15min chart 14 attempts to break 377.3 resistance before it finally in the last minute popped through and closed over it. \n\nIf we see a 3rd day to this rally I will look for resistance of the black bear channel to be tested at 382.2 which is also next resistance. The one thing I am seeing is that this looks very similar to the September 7th to September 12th dead cat bounce. If we look at the stochastics also you can see that we are hitting the same overbought levels that we did back then. While we might get one more push up I do suspect we see downside the end of the week. In order to trust this rally I would like to see 370.6 support back tested and held. \n\nKey support- 375.4 (black support line vbottom) -&gt; 372.4 -&gt; 370.7 -&gt; 366.7\n\nKey resistance- 378 -&gt; 381.4 (black bear channel resistance) -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/738g8lhrrur91.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53f3e8222aef43eb16fbc4148465565bf90399e9\n\nFutures did break through its key black falling wedge resistance. The next major resistance would be up in the 4000s which uses the august and September peaks. Futures also rejected the daily 20ema at the EOD. Unless futures opens green and never loses 3805 support we are going to see that support line broken finally and that could lead to more downside. \n\nKey support- 3805 (black v bottom) -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3735\n\nKey resistance- 3880 -&gt; 3925\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/daomo9xrrur91.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd54541c114bc3bd691fc097d68f57b4448663ad\n\nI am seeing a hanging man candle formed on the Apple daily chart with a rejection of the Daily 8ema. With the phantom print on SPY we are seeing a massive hanging man on spy and the similar one on Apple. Look at the May 17th candle on spy for an idea of what COULD happen. \n\nApple rejected 146 9 times before it finally closed a 15min candle over it EOD. However, even with that close it still is below its daily 8ema. Due to the daily candle structure unless apple opens over 149.4 (2.2% green and holds that all day it will break support and should open the downside). With SPY and Apple I am looking for a double top at 378 and a double top at 146 with a bigger retracement. \n\nBlue bear channel resistance comes in at 148.8 tomorrow which is just below key resistance of 149.4. \n\nKey support- 149.4 (black v bottom support) -&gt; 142.5 -&gt; 141.3 -&gt; 138.2\n\nKey resistance- 146 -&gt; 147.6 -&gt; 149.4 (major resistance) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdyj74gsrur91.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed20bd65dd67af48931f45dac8cf6211d93d6405\n\nAnd then there was Tesla… you gotta love the way this stock moves. Tesla actually looked fairly bullish this morning breaking over yesterdays HOD and looking to test that red falling wedge resistance near 260. However, then ole ELON decided he is gonna buy the twitterpade and well we saw tesla go for $10.86 sell off in less than 15minutes and a total drop of $13.25 over 1.5 hours before it actually attempted to gather some support EOD. I was blessed enough to have some Tesla puts but not blessed enough to get an IV pump on them… Despite teslas impressive drop it actually closed a green day and was able to get over 248.7 resistance that it struggled at for over 11 candles before finally like SPY and Apple EOD was able to close over them. \n\nTesla is peculiar. As it still remains one that has the most to lose as it’s the furthest from its 52week low. Tesla has now also suffered back to back days of “bad news”. Being in the inverse head and shoulders pattern the pattern needs to see 220 to “complete” I do suspect we could see it play out this week. \n\nToday could have definitely been seen as a “rest” day after Tesla got absolutely beat down yesterday. Breaking 242.5 will be the confirmation of downside to come and a close over 255 would signal a possible bigger bounce to test that black bear channel. A breaking of that red support for the falling wedge will be an early signal of the reversal. \n\nKey support- 242.5 -&gt; 237.3 -&gt; 231 (black bear support)\n\nKey resistance- 250 -&gt; 252.4 (red resistance falling wedge) -&gt; 255 -&gt; 260.6 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4dbn9zsrur91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=408068e51fe535684efd9bfeb0cc6d54d2369cb8\n\nThe VIX in all reality did nothing today. It did hold key 28.3 support and the daily 20ema. However, it closed under 30 for the first time since September 23rd. One thing that I am seeing though is a gravestone doji candle body. This appears to have occurred in similar fashion back on September 9th which then led to a massive upturn (granted this was CPI day). \n\nThere is a very big potential with the VIX not unwinding at all on this massive green day on SPY that we could see the VIX revert back to 31-32 tomorrow which would take SPY down and the markets with it. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nSome of my least favorite days to trade are days we have massive gap ups at open… when we have back to back days of gap ups with extremely weird technical (trin, buy pressure, vold, etc. etc.) I know there is little risk to reward. I played a morning tesla put when I saw weakness in Tesla and was reward thanks to musk but I believe either way I would have been by EOW. From there I didn’t play much else besides closing my 28dte call on SPY and playing one quick SPX scalp. \n\nA great trader KNOWS when the technical do not favor their strategy. An even greater trader knows when not to trade and that’s there will always be another day to trade. Today to me was a clear day \n\nYoutube will be up later tonight! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjc1irntrur91.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5e5b1494285d36d036611de54844e8c262f9af\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sarwy35urur91.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c189ac6e726fb66088274be2df865bea05cbb24b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/is4phbpurur91.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cadcbcb9ead741d1dddf06b8fa38aaeb20e8ada\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k07sij4vrur91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f295fbe4e683a9d16a1fa5b8e98ac648cf92548c\n\nBeen a great two days for everyone!'), ('Will AAPL Apple Hit 120 By November?

The last time I checked last week we were at 11, now we are at 31.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsources: Bloomberg article written by Simon White, investopedia, cnn\n\nTl,dr: spy calls it is'), ('10/5/2022 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis', '10/5/2022 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisThe question everyone is wondering is… is the bottom in OR is this still just a convincing dead cat bounce? In my opinion the jury is still out. I am leaning with essentially an inside day on SPY but tech looking pretty strong (apple specifically) and after a very deep red open and massive recovery even going green at open point that we are going to finish this week out green and next week see a retrace in preparation for CPI. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6plwqaur1s91.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28fcc4b885eae5ad97eb97897c617c70e1e94e3a\n\nSpy had broken the previous V bottom support but now we have this v bottom support. We are looking at a pretty fat bodied doji. This should with the two day push, daily 8ema support retest and holding, 370 range support test hold and briefly breaking over 378 before closing just under it provide upside for tomorrow. This to me was a bullish day. We looked extremely doomish this morning and then the bulls stepped in and let this rally almost all day. EOD drop was most likely profit takers. \n\nKey resistance bulls need to conquer tomorrow is the 378 and the daily 20ema. The next major resistance that we will likely push for is 382.1 which puts us through the black bear channel and puts us in line to Friday or next week test the blue bear channel that dates back to August. As long as bulls continue to defend that 370.6 level like they did today I am biased to the upside. \n\nKey support- 373.5 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 366.7\n\nKey resistance- 378 -&gt; 379.8 (black bear channel) -&gt; 382.1 -&gt; 386.4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkst7jsur1s91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a48f24d1280b7c321d2679275164d4e74c4abcc2\n\nIf we look at SPY weekly you can see that there is a pretty big case that we are going to test 3985.2 resistance we also have a very convincing V bottom forming along with retaking the weekly 200ema. If the bulls can take back that weekly 8ema and close over 385.2 this week then that should provide a lot of upside for next week especially with a bullish CPI. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6t6g09vr1s91.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f9d967aa205975bf1f62684313e483480dc6cd5\n\nFutures put in quite the range from 3734 to 3820 today. Futures is currently sitting right at that key 3805 resistance. With a dragonfly doji we should expect upside here. Key v bottom support will be at 3805. With a back test of 3735 previous resistance that should provide a big support base going forward. \n\nSupport- 3805-&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3735\n\nResistance- 3880 -&gt; 3925\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jlijy8rvr1s91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=865eedfbc3010abfd6a887780b41a11f09d5de17\n\nApple looked stronger then the rest of the market all day today. Even this morning when SPY and Tesla were selling off apple was very delayed in its sell off. The other actually impressive thing is that Apple daily candle closed as a bullish engulfing candle at 0.21% when yesterday was a 2.56% green day. Apple also perfectly back filled its gap which should allow for further upside movement. If bulls can retake that key 149.3 resistance that was heavy support previously that would be very bullish going forward. \n\nKey support- 146 -&gt; 144.2 -&gt; 141.4\n\nKey resistance- 147.7 (blue bear channel) -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 150.8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xn33m1awr1s91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=043947d233c77f3d0681318d85a3e41c44ea9bba\n\nMy tesla pattern that I called out 2 weeks ago when it hit 312 has finally played out completely as far as I am concerned. The low average prior to the move up was 222 and the high average was 242 with 234 being the privot point. With a test and pretty impressive bounce off 233.27 today I actually am expecting quite a bit of upside for tesla eow and even next week. \n\nTesla is down 18% in 5 days, 20% in 6 days and 26% in 11 days... In my opinion it is due for a bounce. I believe yesterday before the Twitter news dropped tesla actually was going for a relief bounce closer to 260. I do believe eventually this downside play needed to happen but now its happened we should be looking for upside. As long as Apple and Spy as pushing tesla should push with it. With the closing of a pretty large dragonfly doji after a massive sell off I am looking for that bounce this week on Tesla. \n\nAnother key thing is that the 5 day long (6 tomorrow) resistance line is in play and unless tesla opens under 239.4 (-0.6%) and holds red all day then we will break that resistance and we should see further upside. There is a small amount of room for the huge falling wedge to play out one more day to the downside and test 226 support but I favor with SPY and Apple looking strong that we do bounce. However, if Apple and SPY come out weak tomorrow like today we should see the 220s hit. \n\nIf the upside doesn’t play out intraweek I suspect it plays out next week. \n\nSupport- 234.6 -&gt; 226.4 -&gt; 222\n\nResistance- 239.4 -&gt; 242.3 -&gt; 249.2 -&gt; 254.7 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23rfmyswr1s91.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b30bdbc38eb95d4873fb5f1432e65040deed048a\n\nThe VIX continues to be overall undecided on what it wants to do holding over that key 28.4 pivot level. However we saw a back test of the daily 8ema resistance which did hold and show sell off into EOD. I suspect the VIX to break under that 28.4 level tomorrow which should provide upside potential for SPY. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nAnother pretty killer day for me today. Most of it came from Swings though. I struggled this morning with the techicals which looking back makes sense because I was attempting to find scalps prior to the v bottom rally. Technicals this morning and early afternoon once again were out of wack but by EOD were playing nicely again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3b4htcxr1s91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84c05a5c624c55cd3a2724d8092a89f4c0097aef\n\nAnother pretty great day in the server today! \n\nYoutube will be posted later! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6aucqduxr1s91.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b26567c38d9500b5282d86e55636009a16b7c564\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2t3r6cnyr1s91.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcbf7c335ecd004a6cab7f3a8b70fc5375701bde'), ('2023 dec 610 calls (spy)', '2023 dec 610 calls (spy)I’m going to keep buying until end of January is this just regarded and I need to stop now or am I onto something (I usually only buy 0-3 dte)'), ('Puts on $AAPL?! - Apple’s Hidden Update to Discourage Early Credit Payments: “Current Balance” Option Removed from Default Choices', 'Puts on $AAPL?! - Apple’s Hidden Update to Discourage Early Credit Payments: “Current Balance” Option Removed from Default Choices'), ('TESLA is the key to it all', "TESLA is the key to it allPlease follow my follower's and my posts for insight into TSLA and the reasons why it shall prevail over all other car makers (even the well established ones).\n\nReddit: TSLAshallprevail\n\nThanks and best of luck to all in this crazy market!")], '2022-10-06': [('PUT it away before you CALL TSLA! 🤨', 'PUT it away before you CALL TSLA! 🤨[removed]'), ('Enabled account for options trading', 'Enabled account for options tradingGoing to full send $1k tomorrow morning 0 day exp on Spy Call Buy To Open. \n\nUpdate to come.'), ('GOOGL in the midst of breaking out of a tight downward trend.', 'GOOGL in the midst of breaking out of a tight downward trend.'), ('1K———&gt;38k in 5 months📈 Started with AMD Calls at the beginning, then SQQQ Calls during the meltdown, TSLA Puts just recently, and now im on OXY and XOM Calls with some energy stocks on the side.', '1K———&gt;38k in 5 months📈 Started with AMD Calls at the beginning, then SQQQ Calls during the meltdown, TSLA Puts just recently, and now im on OXY and XOM Calls with some energy stocks on the side.'), ('Is it time to start buying long term spy calls?', 'Is it time to start buying long term spy calls?My plan was to ride the bear market with Spy puts for a few weeks and then buy some calls for like a year out since stonks only go up.

Stocks fell as a result of those bets, propelling benchmark treasury yields to their longest weekly gain since 1984.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Almost 95% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 declined. The drop came just a few days after the index posted its biggest back-to-back gains since the pandemic began, amid speculation that the Fed was approaching "peak hawkishness." Despite Friday\'s drop, those gains gave the index its best week in a month. The tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 dropped nearly 4% on Friday.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10 Yr yields approached 3.9% as they rose for the 10th week in a row. the dollar advanced. The swap contract for the Fed meeting in November factored in nearly 75 basis points of tightening. Market-implied expectations for where the rate will peak also increased, with the derivative contract for the March gathering trading around 4.66%. the current range for the benchmark rate stands between 3% and 3.25%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fed Bank of New York President John Williams stated that rates need to gradually rise to around 4.5%, but the pace and ultimate peak of the tightening campaign will be determined by how the economy performs. Several officials delivered a resolutely hawkish message this week, saying that price pressures remain elevated and that financial market volatility will not deter them from raising rates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After a hotter-than-expected reading in August dampened hopes of a nascent slowdown, all eyes will be on next week\'s US inflation data. Separately, the Fed\'s September meeting minutes could reveal the central bank\'s tolerance for economic pain.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Investors poured the most money into cash since April 2020, fearing a looming recession, but stocks could fall further because they don\'t fully reflect that risk, according to Bank of America strategists. According to their report, cash funds received nearly $89 billion in the week ending October 5th, while investors withdrew $3.3 billion from global stock funds.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;ECB\'s Nagel: We anticipate 1.3% to 1.5% economic growth in Germany in 2022, with growth remaining flat in 2023.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nECB\'s Nagel: We\'ll probably see minor decline in GDP as early as Q3 this year, which is likely to amplify in Q4 and continue in early 2023.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nFed\'s Williams: Over time, the Fed should raise rates to around 4.5%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nFed\'s Williams: I believe that growth will be positive next year, but unemployment will rise.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nUS interest rate futures price in 92% chance of a 75-basis-point Fed rate hike in November, up from 85.5% before September jobs report.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n**US Nonfarm Payrolls Actual 263k (Forecast 255k, Previous 315k)** (Dollar strengthened, S&amp;P 500 weakened, US 10-Y yield strengthened)\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3rm51kg9ls91.png?width=1288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a60e9fbe47990fc0b03b4c60352b8b7b2ec97ea\n\n# 🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/965sgjti9ls91.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=815490cc9623ae6d88b544ee2e1e2aedc88d40bc\n\nFib.

Of the 3 out of 9 times that have been green two have opened less than 1% green and one opened 1.8% green. \n\nThere used to on previous CPIs be a very clear trend of what to expect going into CPI. Generally we would see a 2%+ drop of markets over the two days previous to CPI. However, now we are not quite seeing that trend as clear. The last CPI was the biggest two days rally pre CPI since March. \n\nNow this could have just been a technical dead cat bounce on an odd timing but there is a chance that markets were expecting a better CPI. Last CPI did beat, however, core missed and wrecked us. \n\nI used to promote puts bounce on night 3 before CPI (so for this Thursday CPI that would be buying puts Monday at close) and then selling them Wednesday night (the night before CPI). However, this is not a recommend play thanks to the last CPI. \n\n**What will CPI be? Are we bullish or bearish?**\n\nTrend wise we actually are seeing a decrease in CPI itself. June CPI was 9.1% followed by Julys 8.5% followed by the August 8.3% reading. That would be two decreases in a row. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/umyzp0ldoos91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f85a0beca20aa955787dfa63412a79e9f63bcf97\n\nCurrently the consensus (the one that matters in my opinion) is 8.1%. That means according to the consensus we are expecting our third decreased CPI in a row. Bullish right? Well on the service yes but lets take a deeper look at this… \n\nHistorically speaking this year we have generally seen about a 0.2% +/- variance (0.3% max) on the consensus vs actual reading. This means we can expect 7.9% to 8.3% (7.8% to 8.4% if we use the 0.3% variance). \n\nThat means we are actually more likely to see a beat of the previous CPI, however, if it’s the + then we could be looking at 8.3 to 8.4% which would be at best the same. Why does that matter though? If we get a repeat 8.3% reading that would mean that CPI itself is not actually decreasing. This would lead markets to continue to panic about further and bigger rate hikes. As you can imagine if its over 8.3% that would be even worse. \n\nBut if CPI is lower than 8.3% we really no matter what right?\n\nWell no not necessarily… this is where I made a mistake last CPI. I over looked how important CORE CPI would be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8drmg3eoos91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea50c10ec900f4f238dac4c7f3e2c29cfd7f0816\n\nLooking at CORE CPI itself from March until June we were on a decline each reading. However, July came in as the same reading at junes at 5.9%. However, August came in at a huge upset and a huge surprise reading at 6.3%. this was 0.2% higher than the consensus and also as you can see over the previous CPI of 5.9%. \n\nCORE forecast (6.5%) is already set to be 0.2 higher than previous (with their consensus being 0.2% +/-) so we really could be looking at anywhere from 6.3% (no change) to 6.7%. As you can imagine this is pretty much a given here unless the consensus is off by a lot that we at best will remain the same as Augusts 6.3%. Markets are going to want to see CORE decrease. \n\nThis whole last week of rallying was set because of the fed pausing rate hikes after this next one. As dumb as this is the markets will get a reality check and any hope of a rally or pause is going to immediately be snuffed out once CORE comes in the same and/or higher. \n\nMy thoughts are this BEST case scenario markets get a beat on CPI of 7.9% but a no change on CPI. But the most likely scenario is that CPI comes in at 8.3% (no change) and CORE comes in at 6.7% (huge miss). \n\nThe other thing to keep in mind here is that if CORE misses to the upside with the 0.2% variance again and our reading is anywhere over 6.5% (Marchs CORE) then we are putting in a new CORE high for the year. \n\nThe question remains then… WHAT does markets need in order to rally? Markets need to see CORE come in 6.2% or lower AND need to see CPI come in at 8.2% or lower. That is the only scenario where I see the markets truly open big green… however, if CPI misses or CORE misses (more specially core) then we are likely to have a repeat if not a worse repeat of last CPI. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18ynqoreoos91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9aa6c737094e31347b0f22630e5cf55bbf353821\n\nMany people say that the Cleveland fed nowcast is about as accurate as we can possible get. There is usually also a 0.2% +/- variance on this though. \n\nThis means we should be looking at a CPI of 8% to 8.4% and a CORE CPI of 6.4% to 6.8%. This means that most likely that CORE CPI number is going to come in on a big miss again and that CPI itself is going to be borderline. \n\n**So whats the play? How am I going to play CPI?**\n\nRemembering like FOMC I trade off the data I have analyzed and what the highest probability risk to reward is… \n\nThe issue with CPI is that in the end it comes down to a 50/50 chance. Yes we can analyze the numbers the best we can but in the end we can only guess. But what if we could take a guess out of it? What if we could benefits from which ever way it goes? Ah yes… enters the Stangle! \n\nStrangle Winning side at open (5 OTM Strikes)-\n\nMay CPI=  Not applicable opened at 0.02%  \n June CPI= 278%  \n July CPI= 123%  \n August CPI= 300%  \n September CPI= 211%  \n   \n \n\nLooking at the data above had you opened a 5strike OTM strangle looking at the last 4 CPIs you would average on your winning side 228%. Assuming worse case scenario your loser is -100% (most likely itll be close to -90% at open) then you are looking at and average profit % of 128% total. \n\nThis means if you had had $2000 total and played $1000 on Calls and $1000 on Puts. You would in total walk away on average with a profits of $280. \n\nNote- July CPI despite a pretty nice -1.5% open did not pay very well compared to June, August and September CPI. If we were to factor out Julys low profits we would then have an average winner side of 263%. This means that assuming worst case scenario your loser is -100% your take home profit % is a total of 163%. This means your $2000 strangle nets you a nice profits of $630. \n\nWorst of the last 4 CPIs nets you 23% profits or $230.\n\nThe best of the last 4 CPIS nets you 200% profits or $2000.\n\nSeems kinda like free money right? Well yes and no. The one factor here that could results in a straight loss would be if like May CPI we see markets open 100% flat. However, with in my opinion a lot riding on this CPI I do not forsee that happening. The idea here is going to be CPI beats and markets rallies for 2 months on the false hope of a fed pivot. Or CPI misses and markets panic and start pricing in more rate hikes and potentially a 100bps hike in November. \n\nNow what if you thought CPI was going to miss and you wanted to play it straight up? \n\nWell lets take a look… \n\nLast 4 CPIs had you picked the right direction max gains at open using 5 OTM strike options\n\nJune CPI= 278%  \n July CPI= 123%  \n August CPI= 300%  \n September CPI= 211%\n\nThat means on average you are returning 228% over the last 4 CPIs with 5 strikes OTM if you picked the correct direction. That means if you chose to use your $2000 to pick one direction your $2000 just became $4,560. However, if you chose wrong your $2000 just because $0 before you could even attempt to do damage control. That’s the one bad thing about CPI being pre market… you cant touch it… this also works if like May we have a reaction then markets reverts to flat before open… you may be right and may see gains you can never even close out. \n\nWorst of the last 4 CPIs nets you 123% or $2,460\n\nBest of the last 4 CPIs nets you 300% or $6,000. \n\nWorst case scenario if you are wrong nets you 0% or $0.  \n\n**So whats the play? What the best risk to reward?**\n\nBest risk to reward would be the 5 strikes otm strangle. It is as close to free money and free risk to reward that you can get in a market like this or an event like this. Of course this will ONLY work if there is a big reaction. This will results in a loss if markets don’t move. Granted if the market opens flat the strangle combined would most likely lose less than had you picked one side an chose wrong. \n\nRemember this is 100% a lotto. Even the strangle is not risk free… DO NOT trade money you cant afford to lose or do not want to lose. There will aways be more plays… there wont always be more money.'), ('Pay attention regards according to my Robinhood advance chart, Spy will drop to 345-350 and mark the official bottom.

The Dollar rose while Treasuries fell.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe S&amp;P 500 finished near the day's lows, down more than 2%. The growth-sensitive Nasdaq 100 fell the most, dropping nearly 3% as Treasury yields rose, with the 2-year rate returning to 4.5%. Both indices experienced their first weekly declines of the month.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nEquity markets fell sharply after a University of Michigan survey found that year-ahead inflation expectations rose in early October, while the long-term outlook improved. The increase may be concerning for the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep views anchored. It also comes on the heels of data released the day before that showed a key measure of consumer prices accelerated to a 40-year high in September. However, stocks roared back from early losses on Thursday, in one of the biggest reversals in history.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nIn the most recent Fed comments, officials indicated that they are prepared to raise rates more aggressively than previously planned. Kansas City Fed President Esther George stated that the terminal rate may need to be raised in order to cool prices. The San Francisco Fed's Mary Daly stated that raising to restrictive levels and to between 4.5% and 5% is the most likely outcome.  \nForecasts released last month showed rates reaching 4.4% by the end of the year and 4.6% the following year, up from a current target range of 3% to 3.25%. Following strong payrolls and hot inflation readings, swaps traders have increased bets on rate hikes over the past week, with the market leaning toward back-to-back jumbo hikes at the next two meetings and a high above 4.9% next year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nBonds and the Sterling fell in the United Kingdom, capping off another turbulent week. Gilts fell as Prime Minister Liz Truss confirmed a reversal on a planned corporation tax freeze. On Friday, the Bank of England completed its emergency bond purchases, purchasing £1.45 billion in long-dated and inflation-linked Gilts. Following that, 30-year yields rose 23 basis points to 4.78%, following a drop of more than 30 basis points earlier.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;Fed's Bullard: The appropriate rate range should be in the 4.5%-4.75% by the end of the year, with any further increases in 2023 being data dependent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe UK is in talks with US LNG producers about major purchases - Sky.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nUK's PM Truss anticipates that UK's Chancellor Hunt will agree to no more U-turns on the UK tax package, according to person familiar with the matter. (Sterling weakened)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nFed's Daly: 4.5%-5% is most likely the top Fed Funds Rate, and then hold it there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nFor the first time since March, US 1-Yr inflation expectations have risen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nUniversity Michigan Sentiment Prelim Actual 59.8 (Forecast 58.8, Previous 58.6) (DXY &amp; 2 Yr Yield strengthened, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Gold weakened)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nUK's PM Truss: We have decided to keep increase in corporation tax.\n\n# 🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA\n\nFib.

Once that June 16th 52 week low was in the VIX had already “peaked” and already was on its descent down. The touch of the VIX on June 16th had a huge wick and after that it was a straight sell off. \n\nThe biggest difference is that on the current VIX trend is that we put a new low in on October 13th and about 1 or 2 days before that we “peaked” however we are not seeing the same level of sell off now that we did then. And the overall downward resistance line from that peak was broken today. \n\nThe VIX is still holding that 20ema support and we are still in that danger zone of 28.4 to 33.

The biggest issue of the day was the IV and IV rank was so high from the previous day that the movements yesterday that were paying out an east 10-25% gains were barely paying 5% before it turned against you. It actually was very interesting to see how the premiums were moving today. \n\nA few times I noted in one specific Call play I was in that the price of SPY had fallen and fallen a decent amount where I definitely should have had my 20% stop loss hit, however, with the drop in SPY my call actually rose in value. Then once SPY did bounce my actual premium barely increased in value. It was almost like the actual movement of premiums was happening before the actual movement of SPY happened. I definitely caught a few plays where the technical setup of them looked perfect, however, caught a rogue bounce that stopped me out before I was able to capitalize.

We'll have to see what Q3 brings, but likely it'll be less than the $1.4 eps they made in Q3 '21.\n\nEven apple is seeing eps decline. \n\nMy only point is that we've been in an earnings recession within big tech (and tech in general) for the past several quarters. Tesla has been one of the few outliers. Their eps growth has been explosive, where everyone else has been declining.

Traders often close out        the trades "mere hours" after opening them.     \n\nIn that respect, these professionals are behaving like"full-tilt day        traders, using the certainty of Dealer hedging flows that their orders        create to then amplify and \'juice\' the intended directional market        move," McElligott said.     \n\nTo illustrate his point, the Nomura managing director shared several        charts showing how trading volume in one- and zero-day-to-expiry options        has risen dramatically as a percentage of overall trading volume in        options tied to the performance of the S&amp;P 500 , SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF        Trust (SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ), which are        among the most popular products for traders of equity-linked options.     \n\n Investors piled into these near-expiry options ahead of last Friday\'s        expiration, which likely contributed to the huge intraday reversal that        occurred one week ago on Oct. 13, when the S&amp;P 500 logged        its biggest intraday turnaround on a percentage-point basis since 2008,        according to Dow Jones Market Data.     \n\nOptions tied to equity indexes, exchange-traded funds, and single stocks        often expire on Fridays, but some short-dated options expire on        Wednesdays as well.     \n\nU.S. stocks logged another intraday turnaround on Thursday        when the S&amp;P 500 rose sharply earlier in the day before falling 29.38        points, or 0.8%, to finish at 3,665.78.

I was 100% not expecting a green day and let me tell you if someone woulda told me that we would go from a -1% pre market to closing at 2.43% green today I woulda laughed in their faces. From the lowest point to the highest point SPY moved $12.3 up. \n\nSo where does that leave us? \n\nWell lets take a look at a few MACRO things first here. Next week is the week before FOMC (November 2nd). Now generally if we look at the previous FOMCS 5 out of the 6 last pre-FOMC weeks finished green averaging about a -4.41% drop. However, if we look at July you can see it was the only week where SPY finished green all year. What was the difference? Well that was back when they started the fed pivot/ inflation is getting better narrative. So I ask myself… are we in a inflation sucks, feds never going to stop hiking environment OR are we in an inflation is peaking and feds going to slow the big hikes soon? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kk87uy7kx8v91.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a94673e0a2e47b5b9c4b87eaff0ee8dd55d1a0fc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zsbgobnkx8v91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=277d33fd37be5015be893e3316b2496ed9eeca01\n\nNow I don’t like to include so many tweets in my TA but I find these to be VERY important. So lets break this down here… Next week is the week before FOMC. November 2nd will be FOMC. Followed by the next CPI reading the following week on November 10th. \n\nSo what does that mean. Today Bullard and Daly pretty much said without saying it and the WSJ article said that the fed is most likely going to do a 75bps hike on November 2nd. Once that hike is done in order to not over due it with rate hikes and cause a market crash/ collapse the economy they are most likely going to “pullback” to a 25 or 50bps hike. While this is NOT a pause what this is… is a clear slowing of rate hikes from the mouths of the fed themselves. This is one of the first times we have actually heard them discuss slowing or a lesser rate hike. \n\nWhy is this all important and how does it effect next week? Well the fed is now in a quiet period. What does that mean? That means no fed member can speak publicly to the press or say anything else until FOMC happens. They just left us with some extreme bullish news (even more bullish then when we rallied back in July-August). \n\nMy thoughts are this… next week we rally on this news and expectations of a 75bps hike followed by a 25-50bps hike in December. The week of FOMC we rally when JPOW confirms this news. Then this is when it gets tricky (and I don’t have the CPI consensus numbers yet to give an accurate probability of what CPI will be) but there is a chance that CPI will miss again and even if it does miss there is a chance that we will see markets rally instead of dropping just like the Septembers. Why? Because markets know that even if the CPI is bad the FED is going to slow its rate hikes. So unless JPOW says something different on November 2nd I would be bullish for the new two weeks minimum. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f10r8v8lx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7f26976211a045eb719eec49e35106c1abb6c76\n\nLooking at the SPY daily chart we actually have a really nice W pattern forming. What I am seeing is that today should have been our chance to retest the lower lows of the 350s however we rallied instead. With this daily candle being a two day (almost 3 day) bullishly engulfing candle with a double bottom off 365.1 from here I would expect upside. We have been trading in this grey channel for a full month now. The key resistance for this channel lies at 378.2 and the overall bear channel (blue dotted line) resistance from the August top lies at 378.8 from Monday. If we break through and close over those levels then in the next week or two we should look for a retest of the 390 level. However, if we reject that 378.2 level then I would be looking for us to maintain this grey channel and puts would be the most probable play. \n\nDaily supports- 370.5 -&gt; 365.2 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.5\n\nDaily resistance- 374.3 -&gt; 378.2 -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3pnjfrlx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f25e7a576acef7ddb04be2a5633f5e7a3d157a\n\nOn the SPY weekly we have a very V double bottom forming and we closed back over the weekly 200ema for the first time in a month. However we did fall just short of breaking through and closing over the daily 8ema. While we are still in this black bear channel right now that dates back to August. If SPY breaks through 374.3 at any point Monday or next week we will be through the bear channel resistance and that will open up the upside with a target of 382 to 385. \n\nWeekly support- 363.7 -&gt; 357 -&gt; 348\n\nWeekly resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 385.4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evp2th8mx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc610633efcb8e289e157c95617f47def49ba5f0\n\nAs you can see I am long on calls for SPY next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yavut9omx8v91.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e66ea6cab114266ae34c640db81437e25909e457\n\nLooking at the futures daily chart I feel like the overall V bottom is even more clear. This was a fairly bullish close as the futures daily candle not only backtested and held support at 3675 to form a double bottom it also fully bull engulfed the previous 3 trading days and closed over key resistance of 3760. \n\nFutures will look to target 3880 next week as the next major daily resistance level. \n\nDaily support- 3708 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3586\n\nDaily resistance- 3775 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3875\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4rqz3e3nx8v91.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24227808bd4253b49b04bd19dab5a1dce3a2ef9f\n\nFutures weekly also has a nice V bottom but more notable had a major support area now at 3590 that has been held for 4 weeks in a row now. Futures weekly too closed over the weekly 200ema ofr the first time in a month but did fall short of breaking through its bear channel resistance and daily 8ema. However, unless we see futures Monday open down below 3690 (-2%+ red open) and hold that level all week we will see the futures weekly pattern broken through. This will open up the upside to retest the next resistance level at 3900 which notably is just over the JPM collar of 3870. \n\nWeekly support- 3705 -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3500\n\nWeekly resistance- 3775 -&gt; 3890\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ql9j2dhnx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0273ab8cff0593e5e078a14dfa8ff47f1494852f\n\nOn Apples daily I had called out earlier in the week that Apple was through its August bear channel resistance. However, as soon as it poked through it sold off. I was bearish based on that sell off, however, Apple has found some heavy support on its daily 8ema and at this point has broken through 145.4 resistance and wicked over the next major resistance of 147.5. With a close over the daily 20ema for the first time since September (SPY also closed over its daily 20ema) this is a pretty bullish sign moving forward. \n\nI will be watching that key red v bottom support very closely next week. The next major resistance level to break on the daily is 149.3.\n\nDaily support- 145.5 -&gt; 142.9 -&gt; 141 -&gt; 138.2\n\nDaily resistance- 147.6 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 150.7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6c64c2ox8v91.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c77e13dbdbf41d5b946cf6cbe2207ac51bb87a\n\nThe Apple weekly bear channel has also not been broken yet. However, with 3 week strong support put in at that key 138.2 support level and a nice v bottom support bounce… Apple was able to close over its weekly 8ema for the first time since the week of August 22nd. I will be looking for apple to test that bear channel resistance and break through it next week. Much like SPY unless Apple opens and holds red below 147.3 all week it will take out that bear channel resistance and open the upside. \n\nApple posts earnings on October 27th also to keep in mind. \n\nWeekly support- 141.2 -&gt; 138.2 -&gt; 133.4\n\nWeekly resistance- 147.3 -&gt; 150.5 -&gt; 155.9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0kbrcujox8v91.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aeb78b8ff9ef5fe943243c9d8d5a24ffde653df\n\nMuch like SPY I am bullish for Apple and i am expecting an upside move for Apple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nifh1ryox8v91.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a79cb66b90777a5de72bf67c8743e03ca0eb669\n\nNow Tesla is the wild child of the bunch. I actually had even mentioned in my TA yesterday that I almost was convinced of buying longer DTE calls on tesla because of how hard it bounced and how well it held that 205 support area. Well today reconfirmed my bullish suspicions. I am looking for Tesla to break through that bear channel Monday and see a bigger push up. After putting its 52week low in this week and being absolutely beaten down for the last month straight… Tesla is poised for a big bounce if the markets bounce. \n\nDaily support- 206.3 -&gt; 196\n\nDaily resistance- 215 -&gt; 223 -&gt; 233.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ib64rdpx8v91.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd4b0e0c7e534d1569063b6d899f4cee89d1b673\n\nTesla weekly finally for the first time in 5 weeks broke its resistance line. With a nice bounce off 205 I am looking for a bigger push up. While this is not a true double bottom I am looking for that 205 support level to hold. There is always a chance we could retest it early next week but I believe Tesla will seek upside from here as long as the rest of the market is doing the same. \n\nTesla has a pretty big no mans land from 223 to 255 area. After the May/ June low it spent a lot of time consolidating there before it finally pushed for the 300s. I would expect tesla to attempt to close somewhere inside that range next week. \n\nWeekly support- 205 -&gt; 191.9 -&gt; 167.8 \n\nWeekly resistance- 223 -&gt; 254.7 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0aiog7ypx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6393e383943329d759e51de47f46f93001338a9c\n\nAs you can see with SPY, Apple and Tesla I am attempting to add some Level to Level plays (as I call them) into my trading. I have been absolutely killing it with scalps lately but I see an opportunity as of late to enter some longer DTE plays and play these key level breakouts and break downs. I look forward to incorporating them as time goes on, but also recognizing that not every day or week will have level to level play. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utnevgarx8v91.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a23b9e30200aa2d37b14423cc4ab7d006ba8f3\n\nAnd then there was the VIX. Now you would think with SPY moving $12+ from pre market to HOD and having a nearly 2.5% green day that we would see the VIX massively unwind right? Well you would be wrong. The craziest thing is that as SPY rose the 2nd half of the day the VIX actually rose with it. Now I have said this numerous times but I really just don’t believe the VIX anymore. However, the key takeaway is we close below the daily 8ema and below the daily 20ema for the first time since middle of September. However, we did not lose the bull channel support just yet. This is the last piece to the bullish puzzle. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall a pretty good day for me today and a pretty great week overall.

It\'s a crap deal, that\'s obvious to even somebody as regarded as me.\n\nUltimately then, they would want to move the debt off their balance sheets as quickly as possible. Two options: they already have sold the debt. Now I know nothing about banks, but I assume this is unlikely, considering they haven\'t given anybody money for anything anything yet. Option two: they are currently trying to sell the debt. If it\'s two - now is a terrible time, with rising interest rates and a low appetite for junk bonds. There\'s reports coming out that they\'re having a hard time selling the junk bonds that would finance this deal to other regards. \n\nSo - if banks don\'t want to do it/cant do it without taking huge losses, why can\'t they just back out? The date for them to get out of their contractual obligations is Oct 20th. That\'s passed. The date the twitter deal has to close is the 28th.\n\nIf banks walk, musk will owe 1Bn. Much smaller than the possible billions he could lose on this deal. So it\'s somewhat in his best interest as well to let the banks walk without a fight, in that case, he just points the finger at them and says "aw shucks, I guess I couldn\'t do it after all". He got to sell billions in Tesla stock without crashing the price too hard, and ultimately comes out on top. \n\nSo my thinking is - If we don\'t hear about things moving to close early this week I think the play is to LOAD up on 7DTE far far out of the money puts. Like I mean balls to the wall YOLO level puts. If the deal falls through you could see twitter go to $30 or below.\n\nAm I just extra regarded? Am I missing something entirely? Why is nobody talking about this? I feel like I\'m taking crazy pills because this seems really obvious to me -which is probably why it\'s one of the dumbest plays possible.\n\nTLDR: Tell me why I\'m regarded. \n\nCurrent Positions: TWTR Bearish 4 Contract Spreads 10/28 (54C Buy, 50C Sell, 47P Buy, 45P Sell) $1k credit  \n6/23 SPY Put Leaps'), ('META Earnings YOLO: Jacked up on 1.65x Margin leverage: Meta long 30000 shares vs short 200 Oct28-C140…Do Not Cuck Zuck', 'META Earnings YOLO: Jacked up on 1.65x Margin leverage: Meta long 30000 shares vs short 200 Oct28-C140…Do Not Cuck Zuck'), ('My girlfriend has 125 shares of Apple and gave me seed money.

The yen rose after reports that Japan may have intervened once more to support the currency.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nIt's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;**\\[12:10 ET\\]** Japan intervenes in the FX market to support the yen - Nikkei.  \n**\\[11:56 ET\\]** Fed's Daly: We will do a step-down, not to pause, but to 50 or 25 BPS increments.  \n**\\[11:48 ET\\]** Fed's Daly: According to projections, policy will be tightened to 4.5%-5% next year.  \n**\\[08:52 ET\\]** Fed set to raise rates by 0.75 point and debate the size of future hikes - WSJ.\xa0\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ko57t91jdv91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b50a1caca38ecaa66ed3d0d2ad7515a1775adb1\n\n# Earnings\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dar0im4jdv91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755ac7086cefaa29f543c207b0928c7b77164296\n\n# 🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA\n\nFib.

The selling prices right now are &gt;$2200, above the $1600 MSRP and are currently unavailable for purchase anywhere for less than $2200. Furthermore from source [1], the 4090 was retailing at around $2000 US in the Asian markets but since launch, the price has started to hike up and currently sits at around $3000 US. At the same time, the demand for NVIDIA's H100 GPUs has shot up due to the upcoming China ban. The H100 PCIe accelerator which was available for $11,000 US is now selling for over $33,000$. The SXM version of the same GPU sells for even more but is much harder to come by. \n\nAlthough NVIDIA has suspended sales of their high-end AI GPUs in China, they have up till September 2023 to fulfill all current orders. Nvidia says that they are applying for export licenses for non-military use in China. The NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs can also be supplied through Hong Kong before 1st September 2023 so it looks like there's at least 1 year of time given to customers to finalize their orders with NVIDIA. Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales (~10% of total datacenter sales from China) of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It said it plans to apply for exemptions to the rule.\n\n&gt;If GPU prices go up however, this potential lost booking might not be as bad as people think. It could actually prove to be a tailwind.\n\n&gt;People also don't realize that the 4090 absolutely destroys AI workloads (just not to the same scale as H100 due to the lack of NVlink) from [3]. I suspect a chunk of AI chip demand will come from mid-scale enterprise (not hyperscalers) scooping up 4090s going forward after the Sept 2023 ban. \n\nNVIDIA Clean Sweeps MLPerf AI Benchmarks With Hopper H100 GPU, Up To 4.5x Performance Uplift Over Ampere A100. Biren [2] chips were a strong competitor of Ampere but now they are banned from using any advanced node unless they get export licenses. Where will China get their AI chips after Sept 2023? This will make GPU prices incredibly elevated for at least the next year. \n\nThere are geopolitical risks but these risks are in some ways good for Nvidia in the long term. The upcoming recession is causing trouble for AI chip companies as this industry is very winner-takes-all (ask AMD). The china ban got rid of Nvidia's main competition from Biren and Huawei. I was bearish on Nvidia short term due to China, but after the recent hot 4090 and H100 demand and the 4090 benchmarks, I am bullish on NVDA. \n\n[1] https://wccftech.com/nvidia-allegedly-shifts-geforce-rtx-4090-gaming-gpu-production-to-hopper-h100-ai-gpus/\n\n[2] https://wccftech.com/china-biren-gpus-cant-be-made-at-tsmc-due-to-us-regulations-competition-with-nvidia/\n\n[3]  https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/NVIDIA-RTX4090-ML-AI-and-Scientific-Computing-Performance-Preliminary-2382/"), ('To the dude who’s quitting his job when his OTM short-dated SPY puts ‘print’ on Monday.', 'To the dude who’s quitting his job when his OTM short-dated SPY puts ‘print’ on Monday.'), ('Not bad for a quick hold on TSLA', 'Not bad for a quick hold on TSLA'), ('In my early 20s, need some advice', "In my early 20s, need some adviceI've just recently finished university and working full time now.

Covid was a strain on the market because of the forward thinking schizophrenic hive-mind that is traders.  They foresaw massive supply chain disruption and it is definitely here.  It is miraculous that we haven't seen more problems arising from Apple yet.  The new iPhone was announced as being delayed and stock quickly dropped and recovered.

Well, buying new tech is a hobby. An expensive one.  As the strain tightens, the products already in circulation will be bought and replaced with other products as the collectors dump their phones into the market.

I am someone that preaches and preaches risk management and small gains till im blue in my server. However, I failed to practice what I preached. \n\nLets take a look at the win % of July and August 71.76% vs. my current 84.16% win rate currently. Yes a 84.16% win rates impressive in my opinion but with my strategy I can and should be profitable with a 71.76% win rate? So why was I note profitable? Lets take a look at a few weeks of trades and its pretty easy to see why. \n\nNote- for those of you who question why I use excel to show my losses/ wins this is why cause I can analyze things in a way that TOS does not let me. \n\nNow what do you see? In terms of stop losses there were no stop losses. I thought I was smarter then the chart. I thought that I just got a bad bounce and it would come back to me. What I ended up doing was putting myself in such a whole that I couldn’t recover. \n\nFor the week on the left had I closed stuff out at -20% I would have finished the week at +$1974 and on the right I would have closed the week at $1890. Same win rate… but completely different result… So not even changing the loss from a win BUT changing where I close out my loss (and more importantly accepting my loss at -20%) would immediately have turned two of those 6 week green (and actually would have turned every one of those 6 weeks green and even looking back from January to June I believe 90% of my weeks had I closed out at -20% on my losses… and not increased my win rate or anything else… I would have been profitable on every single week.). \n\nSo when people ask me “what did you change?” “its impossible for someone to have 8 green weeks!” “its impossible for someone to recover like that!”\n\nI say no its not… I say and I say this to 90% of people who blow their accounts up or have a green week go red… “where was your stop loss?”   \n \n\nRisk management and mitigating our losses is about 100x more important then taking proifts. There are actually numerous strategies out there that can have 40-60% win rates BUT with proper stop losses can have extremely profitable results. \n\nThere is a rule called the 10/20 rules… the goal should be 10% profits and we should use a HARD -20% stop loss. We can not think about it and we can not try to out smart it. This is another reason I stopped playing 0dte lottos as they would result in -90% losses I could recover. \n\nHonestly I could stop right here but there is a few other minor things that have helped me.\n\n**Position sizing**\n\nI have talked about this since forever but I always say that your options account should be 10% of your total investment portfolio. That means if you have $10,000 to invest (for simple numbers) you should really only have about $1000 in your options account. And of that 10% you should only be trading with at MOST 10% of the 10%. That means each position size should only be about $100. \n\nWhy? Why so small? We have to assume the worst. If we use $100/ trade on a cash only account (which if you haven’t switched to a cash only account SWITCH NOW!) then we can make about 10 trades per day. That means with the 10/20 rule and about a 70%-80% win rate we can remain profitable every day. Its about quality quantity not one quality trade. This is a mistake I made in July and August also. \n\nI was so focused on making one good trade that I would end up making a bad trade or wait so long to enter that I would get stopped out immediately. \n\nSomething I did and HIGHLY recommend people do is to size heavily down in times of bad trading… when I recognized in June and July that I was struggling I sized down by 1/5th per trade. And then I sized down another ½ in the really bad times. From there focusing on the % gains not the $ gained I was able to gather myself and now I have gone from $500/ trade to $1000/ trade to $1500/ trade and now im pretty content at about $2000-$2500 per trade and I don’t think I will size up again for a while. Maybe another month or so of consistency and I will size back up. \n\nThe number one goal should always be capital preservation. Remember the light at the end of the tunnel is the end of this bear market and a return to the “easy” times of a bull market. \n\n**Win rate doesn’t= profit** \n\nThis is something I wish I would have taken to heart even earlier then I did. I had a really respected trader tell me this all the time when I was so proud of my 80% win rate. But he reminded me (and so did my weekly log) that win rate doesn’t equal profitable. There are actually a lot of strats out there where you can be holding a 40-60% win rate and still make money. This plays into the first and most important point of all of this… STOP LOSSES ARE KING. \n\n**Trusting myself**\n\nThis is the last point I want to make. In this market we have to trust ourselves and have confidence in our trades. Something that I experienced in this bear market for the first time was lack of confidence in myself. There was so many times where I would enter a trade (back before my hard set stop loss days) and I would get a rogue $3 green candle (like we saw this week) that would wreck my position beyond belief. I would finally take my loss and then we would see some wild bounce $6 the other way back in my favor. Where had I just held I would end up green. \n\nThis is where this 2022 market is absolutely brutal and I have seen some pretty decent traders wash themselves out of this market. When we lose confidence in ourselves we lose confidence in the plays we make. I struggled with this (and honestly some of it was pressure on myself to be perfect and to never lose cause of the server and I have a lot of eyes on me). But I know im not perfect and I know no matter how perfect a setup works in the end we will never win everytime. Sure it was fun when I had like a 35 green trades in a row win streak but honestly it was just luck. \n\nWhat I have learned is when we recognize a trend we do not fight momentum nor do we fight the trend. BUT it is okay to say I don’t like this setup, I don’t like this day, or this isn’t my ideal setup and to sit cash gang. There are so many people who fail to understand the importance of the fact that cash IS a position. You cant lose money sitting cash. WAIT for YOUR setup to come to you. \n\nAnother thing I struggled with for a while was traders paralysis. I had so many things I was waiting to be “perfect” before I entered a trade that by time the crystals would align I would have missed the move already. This plays into my last and final point. \n\n**Aggressive without being wreckless**\n\nSpeaking of trader paralysis what I found is that in waiting for everything to be perfect by time I got into the trade that initial little pop that gets you that 10% in 30 seconds had already pasted and I was left with the bread crumbs of bread crumbs waiting for the 10% pop that never came. \n\nI found that through those red weeks and endless days and weekends backtesting and backtesting and backtesting I found what works for me. What is the post HIGH PROBABILITY risk to reward plays. In my server often times you’’ll hear me play these “bounce or die” or “die or bounce” plays. \n\nThat is what I mean about high probability plays. Often times these are when the indicators are favoring lets say a call and SPY 15min chart has retraced to a key support and is sitting on it. Everything points to a bounce back up but its not perfect yet. \n\nI would rather take a play that has a high probability of success then wait so long for confirmation that I end up never seeing profits. I trade a fine line between aggressive and wreckless. With the 10/20 rule a 0dte gives you enough wiggle room to be slightly off on timing with being aggressive BUT if you are too aggressive (aka wreckless) then you end up just stopping out and then it plays out how you expected. \n\nI hope this helps you guys if you have any questions let me know!'), ('Meta Stock', 'Meta Stock[removed]'), ('Watching Meta calls blow up', 'Watching Meta calls blow up'), ('Recession avoided, meta 5ever', 'Recession avoided, meta 5ever'), ('bro bought meta calls 💀', 'bro bought meta calls 💀'), ('Finally a good day and week!

As you can see, in 2021, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 64 cents was going to costs. In 2022, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 80 cents is going to cost. We're seeing a 45.66% decline in operating income. Also they are paying 21.18% in taxes which we will use later in our picture 4 calculation.\n\n[Meta analysis 2](https://imgur.com/Qk325WQ)\n\nIn the 2021 quarter, eps came in at 3.22 and in the 2022 quarter, eps came in at 1.64. That is essentially a 49% drop. If we're looking at diluted shares outstanding, the number declined by 6% meaning they are outpacing stock based compensation with their buyback program. Their total share based comp expense has increased 31.74% which is understandable given they are growing a new revenue segment\n\n[Meta Analysis 3](https://imgur.com/IUKfISN)\n\nThe information here shows the revenue segments and as we can see, from the 2021 quarter to the 2022 quarter, reality labs revenue dropped by 48.92% and the family of apps revenue dropped by 3.6%. Given that reality labs is the segment they are pouring money into, this is highly unwelcoming news. This quarters loss on the reality labs segment also came in significantly higher and compared to 2021 quarter, was 39.57% higher.\n\n[Meta Analysis 4](https://imgur.com/GAb3pG9)\n\nNow if we remove reality labs, EPS would come in around 2.71 versus the 1.64 we got.

Let me know in the comments.\n\nThis week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.\n\nThe following is basically my plan for next week.\n\n# Major Economic Events\n\n**Monday 10/31**\n\n9:45 AM Chicago PMI\n\n10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct\n\n**Tuesday 11/01**\n\n9:45 AM S&amp;P Global PMI Final Oct\n\n10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct\n\n10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep\n\n**Wednesday 11/02**\n\n8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct\n\n2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision\n\n2:30 PM Fed Press Conference\n\n**Thursday 11/03**\n\n8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep\n\n10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct\n\n**Friday 11/04**\n\n8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct\n\n8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct\n\nSo all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.\n\nSo my play here is in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1 - The Rate Hike\n\nBelieve it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77\n\nAs of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing\n\n0% chance of 100Bps\n\n81.3% chance of 75Bps\n\n18.7% chance of 50Bps\n\nNow in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.\n\nIn all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.\n\nPart 2 - The Meeting\n\nWell this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.\n\nIf they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.\n\nThis part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.\n\nAnyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.\n\nThe fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)\n\nOn the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.\n\nAs you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.\n\nGuys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.\n\nBut like i said we shall see.\n\n# Earnings\n\n# Tue 1 Nov\n\n**After Close - Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD)**\n\n* Technology/Semiconductors\n* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST\n* Estimates: EPS $0.57 &amp; Revenue $6.7B\n* Options pricing in a 12.1% move on earnings\n* My Play: Been in this one for a while, since it reported Revenues and dropped hard but i keep selling because it keeps running.

Notice the RSI. \n\nEquities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.\n\nWhat did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. \n\nWhat about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn\'t as hot, but it wasn\'t cool enough. \n\nIs the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. \n\nWhat about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn\'t. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. \n\nWill POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don\'t think so. He was able to stand Trump\'s tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn\'t worried about job security,** he wants to be "the man" to solve this problem. \n\n**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. \n\nDid Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can\'t save the market single handedly.** \n\nDid the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn\'t. \n\nIs the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don\'t have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. \n\nWhy did we rally? **Historic put buying was "closed" and historic "bearishness" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** \n\n**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. \n\nFor some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** \n\nCounter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   \n\n\n**How to Trade It:**  \n\n\n* With the VIX "relatively low" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. \n* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It\'s going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. \n* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.\n* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves.

What a frightfully boring day today was… This honestly was one of the worst choppy range days I have seen in months. The total range for today on SPY was $3.14… usually we see that level of movement on the opening candle of SPY. \n\nThe question remains where are we headed? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sja1wwyjn7x91.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5af9d65c426d9ec3063ba7bd36ef14e1c078159a\n\nThank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4h1f3nekn7x91.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dce38d2bc2709e6acc983596099c37400eacd16\n\nToday we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. \n\nOvernight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. \n\nKey support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378\n\nKey resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.2 -&gt; 393\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf02w4xkn7x91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2a2012870dd57f88567609213c8e4d44becf9be\n\nFutures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. \n\nIts not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.\n\nKey support- 3870 -&gt; 3845 -&gt; 3800\n\nKey resistance- 3925 -&gt; 3975\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75s55sbln7x91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3186b6392b9fa2609251fc6f6fd378f4bd58f162\n\nNot much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. \n\nApple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. \n\nKey support- 151 -&gt; 148\n\nKey resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.8 -&gt; 157.4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mihozrtln7x91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=546ac9f63d50ed5dcbf5e669ff51ff97c092a9cb\n\nTesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. \n\nUntil Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. \n\nKey support- 224.8 -&gt; 219.3\n\nKey resistance- 230 -&gt; 234.2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0cs5dknn7x91.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c4529f0d2b4bf1e2a3ff680a5474bea171c579\n\nYou gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. \n\nSome of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. \n\nOverall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. \n\nFOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. \n\nI also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpvi8i5on7x91.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a2874c15f1667138319a8a6f0de51c94dc5841f\n\nClosing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. \n\nI posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p9hkg8mon7x91.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bff9726a6c257cd9e638320a59dfb3e46b19b999\n\nMostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely. \n\nNo youtube tonight!

Once or twice, I had to open a new nearly-naked Put position to buy out or roll another one. Like paying off a credit card with another credit card. Financial coaches always recommend that kind of behavior, right?\n\nWell, this week, I had 3 of these riskier semi-naked Put positions hit a trifecta. Bad press, bad earnings call, and the Fed Meeting. All 3 plunged 50-80% in days. Far below the Strike. Of the 3, there is really only 1 that I wouldn't mind owning.\n\nRolling will cost me almost all my gains from the last year, most of which are already invested into other shares that are covering a Call position. So I'll probably have to infuse more cash to buy back or roll at least 2 just to prevent a forced assignment 50% above the share price. Income accounts are meant to withdraw from, not dump more into just to avoid losing even more cash.\n\nPlease learn these lessons:\n\n1. Don't sell a Put on a company that you don't want to own.\n2. Have the cash in your brokerage to cover it.\n3. Don't transact right before Earnings season when it's already a volatile stock.\n4. Low volume Options are harder to roll your way out of.\n5. Limit your Puts to 1-2 at any given time.\n6. Don't be greedy.\n\nFortunately for me, these are all low dollar mistakes. I set a personal cap at $25 share price to sell a Put, and that saved my hide. Had this happened with high flyers like Meta, I'd be hosed.\n\nAnybody can make easy money once, but the tenth time will bite you bad. Invest wisely."), ('spy calls before job report tomorrow?

All this jargon essentially means it is a 3rd party platform that allows for ads to be personalized. This sounds all awesome until you realize some key features of the stock.\n\n1). Massive competition \n\nAs stated before TTD is a digital ad provider. They use a lot of jargon to make themselves seem more innovative than they are but at the end of the day they are a little fish in a big pond. Their biggest competition comes from ad dynamos like Meta and Google. They also have to compete with a large number of others like Amazon and Microsoft who are smaller players but still massive compared to The Trade Desk.\n\n\n2). The premium is too high\n\nThey have a P/E ratio of 680 and if they can’t produce a profit this quarter, the P/E will only get higher if they can’t produce a significant profit during these earnings. If this is coupled with the fact that revenue growth is slumping and profit is drying up, the stock will drop immensely because people will consider it overvalued.\n\n3). Unfriendly economic conditions for ads\n\nWe are in a recession and when in a recession advertisers spend less on ads. The reason being that they will get significantly smaller returns because less people will have disposable income to spend on unnecessary products. This is very bad for TTD due to the fact their business relies on advertisers and if they get scared they're revenue and profit will grow significantly less. But all of this combined with the next point is what will cause the catastrophic drop that is about to occur.\n \n4). The guidance nail in the coffin\n\nGuidance is what this market lives off of now. We've seen it a million times, especially with PAYPAL and others where companies can have  decent earnings but terrible guidance and drop accordingly. TTD will have bad guidance so to the fact that in a recession nothing is guaranteed, especially not for advertising and they can't have good guidance because of the economic conditions.\n\n5). Bull thesis\n\nThis is the devil's advocate that I personally don't believe but it is important to include so people see the whole picture. Last earnings, TTD shot way up on great revenue growth. I don't think this will occur due to the reasons stated above but it is a possibility and important to keep in mind \n\n7) TL;DR\n\n$TTD(The Trade Desk), is an overvalued digital ad provider who will flop on earnings due to slowing revenue growth, shrinking profit and poor guidance.\n\n8). Position.\n\nI have 44.5 puts expiring next week but I'm going in on more tomorrow and probably at a lower strike. I know it's not a lot but I'm 18 and my family is poor as shit so I'm going all in with an extra 7K on Monday.

The biggest bullish moves today was confirming the daily 20ema as support, closing over the daily 8ema support and closing back inside the green channel. The next step for bulls is to take our 380 resistance that held us up end of day and close over the 50ema. With the black rising wedge still in tact you can see my next target for SPY is that 388.5 to 390 level which I believe we could see before Wednesday EOD. \n\nHowever, tomorrow we have to see SPY break through 380 which is where that red resistance line for the pre fomc/ fomc sell off intersects. Once we break through that then this sell off from CPI is effectively over and we can look for some upside. However, if bears manage to hold us under 380 we could see a potential double top at 380 and look for a closure back under 378 which then would show signs of weakness for Wednesday. \n\nSupport- 378 -&gt; 376.2 -&gt; 374.7 -&gt; 371.4\n\nResistance- 380 -&gt; 384 -&gt; 388.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8megzjdgrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f4d22aad569cd1026ec839c93353a6f42c866b0\n\nFutures is holding within the blue rising wedge still also. It’s a little hard to tell but I highlighted in purple that key 3805 level which futures if finally going to close over (this is much like 378 for spy). With this closure it opens us up for the next key level of 3925. \n\nIf 3805 is lost and especially closed under again tomorrow then we will look for a retest of the mid to lower 3700s. \n\nKey support- 3805 -&gt; 3750 -&gt; 3675\n\nKey resistance- 3865 -&gt; 3925\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r69c3tugrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc1041bb2933bdcabaaf0768a85e94e06559ee8c\n\nApple despite looking extremely weak this morning on more china news managed to pull out a green day with a nice hanging man candle finish and still maintained a closure over 138.1 support. Though Apple barely scrapped by with a green day apple will look to test that steep red bear channel resistance tomorrow. If they can break through 139.9 resistance it should open up some more upside and possibly look to see that 145 gap fill. \n\nKey support- 138.1 -&gt; 137.1 -&gt; 135\n\nKey resistance- 142.1 -&gt; 145\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26c8fmahrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdf936215c353596806171a603932ab9f0750a87\n\nAnd then there was Tesla…. She giveth and she taketh just as fast. I mentioned that pretty massive diamond pattern that hard formed on tesla last week and we officially did break through the support line and now only that we broke all the way through the red sideways channel. I took a pretty big L on my tesla calls (shoulda closed for break even at open) today looking for a recoil off the lows like it has historically done. \n\nHighlighted by the 4 blue arrows here is the last 4 times a new low was put in. As you can see the following days resulted in pretty impressively green bounces. I am playing some calls for that historical bounce. With a new 52 week low put in and seemingly no catalyst for further dropping I like the odds of a bounce at least beast to reconfirm 205.6 as resistance. However, if we see further sell off tomorrow I will accept my loss on it. The 15min chart is forming a nice 197 double double bottom. \n\nKey support- 197 -&gt; 193.3 -&gt; 184.3\n\nKey resistance- 201.8 -&gt; 205.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zngtnoqirly91.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9b10b3e5e7e7e1faf0e9381751d5f869fc9b603\n\nThe VIX seemingly continues to point to more upside to come. Which is actually fairly impressive considering CPI is in 3 days now. I would have expected to at least (though we did at open) see some fear being put back into the markets. However, we actually formed a bearish daily engulfing candle (bearish because its red but for SPY this would be bullish). We also continue to reject the daily 8ema on the VIX. I mentioned last week that premiums are very cheap for longer DTE right now but I believe you are way too early to be going long as the VIX hasn’t hinted at any sort of upside in weeks. Actually what is even more impressive of the last 20 trading days… the VIX has either closed red OR closed &lt;1% green. The fear in this market is gone right now. Which leads to me show this next chart. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfln1xilrly91.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e379545443901d6c0c50c5a1f720a6322505f6c6\n\nLooking at the fear and greed index… we are actually at the highest level of greed that we have been at since January of 2022. Which for those of you who forgot… from January 4th (about peak of the greed of 65) to January 27th (roughly the bottom of the greed index of 20) SPY fell from 479.98 to 420.76 or fell $59.22 and 12.4%. \n\nThe current FG index reading is 61. The January 4th peak was 65 before it dropped us to a fear of 20. The April peak hit 62 before it finally sold of and dropped us to the May 12th fear level of 3 (wow). August 12ths peak hit 68 before it dropped us to our September 30th low of 15.  \n\nJanuarys drop= 12.4% drop over 13 days  \n Aprils drop= 16.7% drop over 32 days  \n Augusts drop= 17.4% drop over 32 days  \n   \n \n\nThat would mean we COULD be gearing up for roughly a 15.5% drop over the next about 26 days… that would give us roughly a drive target (from todays close) of 321.06 by December 12th…. \n\nNow hear me out on this one which is even more WILD… December 12th is the next CPI reading (after this Thursday) and then FOMC is on December 13th (the day after)…. Is it possible that we are about to see a top put in this week and this CPI is about to start a slow bleed down to 320 over the next month? Its possible… \n\nSomething to consider for this CPI that is coming up here in 3 days now. I still favor as I said last week a green Monday and Tuesday (half way there) followed by either a green or red Wednesday which would most likely result in a nice inside day. Then Thursday is going to be a huge miss on CPI ( analysis was posted to the server on my trade plan). This huge CPI miss could have the weight to start the next leg down on SPY especially depending on what happens with the mid term elections this week. \n\nDaily log- \n\nToday was my first red day since I believe September 1st. Didn’t miss it by much but red nonetheless. I held my tesla call far too long and should have realized that loss much faster. I also had another break even attempt to exit it this morning and failed to take it… though I wouldn’t have pinned tesla for a new 52 week low today at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3mcji9mrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28b6552ea94c4714d5fce056b25a70f6405f6f37\n\nSomething important to keep in mind with red days is that we can not let a day be so red that it makes not only the day but the week red. For me despite the bigger loss this week easily will be a green week if I continue to trade well. Another thing that many traders make the mistake of doing is revenge trading. They see that red day and think dang it I really need to get green today let me force this trade or let me do XYZ and they end up turning a manageable red day into a unmanageable red week. \n\nThe best thing to do is start the day fresh. Every day is a new day and every week is a new week… every trade is a new chance… If you had a great win or a huge loss on your last trade, day or week we can not let that sway us or change or mechanics. \n\nSomething I am going to intertwine on my level to level plays is a -25% stop loss on all plays. If they play is done correctly then If it hits that red I was wrong and it wont really come back to life. Trading a longer DTE on these allows for plenty of movement before -25% ever happens. This was the struggle I always had with scalps before I set a mechanical stop loss was that I would marry my play. I don’t want to get in a habit of that with these level to levels even though I know sometimes they need time to mature… this COULD result in a lower win rate as I may stop out more BUT for instance today had I stopped out on my Tesla and SPY level to levels that closed very red I would have ended up very green today. \n\nActually had a capped my L2L plays at -25% today for the two losers I would have only closed down -$50 for my L2L plays and with my $1249 from scalps today woulda ended the day up $1199 instead im ending it down about $103. \n\nYoutube will be up later! \n\nHope you guys had a great day.'), ('Firstrade mail about their new options interface features the “ABC Corp.” not to sponsor any particular stock… yet they forgot to take “AMD” out of the bar in the center, Damn regards', 'Firstrade mail about their new options interface features the “ABC Corp.” not to sponsor any particular stock… yet they forgot to take “AMD” out of the bar in the center, Damn regards'), ('NVIDIA top cards burning in computers...', "NVIDIA top cards burning in computers...I've noticed a huge influx of posts like this (I follow a lot of nerdy subs), and the silence by NVIDIA is deafening.

Again, this is a profitable short meaning that profit taking could occur hence covering hence an increase in price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2) The lending fee dropped but not to the previous levels**\n\nThis indicates the short is either fully or partially still open. Borrowing fees increase or decrease based on demand, so the decay in the lending price may just be a sign that this short is holding and isn’t creating new lending demand.\n\nIt’s also possible the short has been covering into the recent market downturns on CPI prints and that he’s halfway liquidated his short with a massive profit but is still holding onto \\~half of his position or around 6 mil shares.\n\nIn either case, there\'s an active short here and if they\'re a reasonable short who won\'t go for the bankruptcy lotto, they\'ll close their short once decently profitable or on signs that the market may be due for an upturn (e.g today\'s 7.7% CPI print).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I think this short is close to covering and positive price action will soon follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Other indications of a future increase in price (Crackpot shit)\n\n Well, basically if you believe this crackpot bullshit i made right here, this stock loves to double tap the bottom RSI before immediatelly going for an increase in price. I\'ll be honest, i believe my own crackpot  bullshit because it\'s served me well on plenty of occasions.\n\nAccording to the screenshot below, the time between RSI taps seems to be getting bigger and bigger over time and their frequency is further apart each time.

Now if the market shits its pants, this lucky short gets to cover his short in a falling market and we get to eat shit, so keep that in mind too, but if the market holds up, there\'s a chance for some decent price improvement to maybe $2.7 - $3.1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\'s some of my PT\'s for a short cover spike (not sustained price) based on the above:\n\n* Realistic Scenario $2.79 - $3.10 next 3 months\n\nChance for $1.17 before any of this happens.

But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. \n\nElon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here. \n\n*”DD”*\n\nTesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. \n\nSo Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. \n\nTesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. \n\nPeople love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. \n\nCheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. \n\nFord has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. \n\nVW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. \n\nTesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. \n\nSo the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. \n\nThe economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don’t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won’t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it’s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who’s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.\n\nChina is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They’re moving into Europe, I don’t see them moving to North American markets soon. It’s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they’re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I’d buy their stock if they weren’t IOUs from the CCP. \n\nI haven’t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn’t include  FSD because it’s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don’t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. \n\nTLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, with a forward PE of only 35 I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.\n\nPosition 33.69 shares (ik I’m poor).'), ('Gotta add that spy glaze 😈 turn me over baby', 'Gotta add that spy glaze 😈 turn me over baby'), ('All in spy puts baby📉📉', 'All in spy puts baby📉📉'), ('FB Naysayers All 👂 s plz : Zuck spent an extra $8B in YTD R&amp;D through 9/30.

I haven’t really been doing it on purpose per say but I have found that I have take a major risk off on Scalps this week. I have only scalped a total of 9 times this whole week (about 3/ day). However, in the last month or so I have been averaging 5-10 scalps/ day. I also have seen a major uptick in my level to level plays now fronting about 8-10/ day when over the last month I have at best done 2-4 a day. \n\nOverall I would say win rate and profits have been consistent with this change. I still believe we are in a scalpers market but I have really been enjoying these level to level plays. While I find that humbly I am good at scalps and good at recognizing high probability set ups. IT has been a really nice change of pace to be able to open a play and let it play out without having to have my finger on sell the whole time and without being worried about one small pop stopping me out only for it to come back to my favor. \n\nSomething to keep in mind in my level to level plays and really in any strategy you deploy in this market is the risk to reward. I am not perfect and it would be practical to have a 100% win rate all the time… yes at times I have done it for short periods of times but its improbable to expect it. What we need to focus on is high probability and high risk to reward set ups. So this means we have to be willing to go into a position that COULD stop us out at out -20%. But the risk to reward and probability of green is high enough that the reward out weighs the risk. It is also important in this market to use stop losses. \n\nMost importantly though it is important to be mechanical in those stop losses. The second you remove that stop loss “to let it play out” you already loss. You loss because you broke your rules in an attempt of being smarter than the market. \n\nStay mechanical. Take the high probability plays. Don’t be afraid to take 3-5% if that means green. If you see it going against you… we don’t have to let it play all the way to the stop loss.   \n   \n \n\nYOUTUBE will be up later!'), ('How to get started with more risky investments', 'How to get started with more risky investmentsDear degenerates,\n\nI consider myself an index, buy-and-hold, DCA,  long-term investor.

The one thing i will say is that as low as the VIX is right now… it sure shows signs it doesn’t want to stay there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfq05cbxt70a1.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bceb8d88dc64a122111ae099429909bfb085c4f\n\nThe one thing that did happen today that is important to note even before that huge dump with the Poland “incident” is that SPY had a massive pre market attempted to break out over the daily 200ema at open and then from there was stuck in a tight range and even before the Poland news broke it appeared we were looking at a bigger sell off EOD. \n\nNow SPY is faced with a nice daily 200ema attempt and rejection with a doji candle. So the question will be which should be answered tomorrow is… did we just put the top in with that 200ema rejection or did we just reject to gather further support before we push through this major resistance point? I still remain indifferent here as I did note that the VIX was pushing up this morning even before the Poland news drop. So it could be that at these levels people are finally starting to put some downside protection back on. However, I do still think its too early to go long on puts here but I also think its silly to be long on calls here also.\n\nSupport- 398.5 (key pivot point) -&gt; 395 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 390.1\n\nResistance- 401.9 -&gt; 405.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ra3egbrxt70a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4e21b3fd3ae31ab341e4c2ca95dd267553b9660\n\nLooking at futures daily compared to SPY daily there is quite a bit of a difference in the daily candle structure. On Futes we actually see a really large wicked double top at 4002 gravestone doji. This to me is set up as a far more bearish indication then SPY daily shows. \n\nFutures has struggled now 3 days in a row to break through 4002 and most importantly to close over it. This is our key pivot level. If futures can close over 4002 then I do forsee a case for 4100. However, IF we reject or fail to retest 4002 again then I am looking for support down 3900. The key support level is 3965. \n\nSupport- 3965 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3900\n\nResistance- 4002 -&gt; 4027 -&gt; 4060\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0neyc8yt70a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc52fdd5a93ed797457892c4d13fcb8a2e266bb3\n\nTesla had started out bullish in my opinion breaking through that falling wedge resistance and breaking over and holding over the daily 8ema for a while. I was actually bullish on Tesla thinking with this breakout we could see a run for the daily 20ema and possibly channel resistance at 208.8. However, we ended up loosing support and closing back under the daily 8ema. With the daily 8ema closed under I am seeing a very strong resistance at 196.1. Until this level is broken and the daily 8ema is closed over I do expect further downside or at minimum consolidation. \n\nSupport- 190.8 -&gt; 185.7 -&gt; 177.4\n\nResistance- 196.1 -&gt; 201 -&gt; 204.9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwd8stizt70a1.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74f97e505024fa967801a45662891d8c2a460ce8\n\nWe did see a pretty nice breakout of this bear channel today on the VIX. The thing I noted and mentioned earlier is that we saw the VIX was holding 23.5 and was actually pushing up even before the Poland new hit the markets. With the VIX options expiration tomorrow its very possible that is why we saw this movement up. Or as I had mentioned with spy at 400/ spx at 4000 range now I do wonder if we are seeing people put their downside hedges back on. I mean it doesn’t take a brainiac to realize we are STILL in a bear market and things STILL aren’t that great in the economy and realistically no one knows exactly what JPOW is going to do next month at FOMC. \n\nThere still is a very real scenario where JPOW says 50 bps hike and hints at another 50bps next meeting in January. On top of that there is nothing saying after 5 consecutive decreases on the CPI YoY readings that we don’t get a rogue spike in CPI YoY that sends the markets tumbling. At this point with the markets now expecting a beat on CPI any miss is going to get bloody… like historically bloody type of days…\n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t69kkk00u70a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8341e101162fcf735d9fe88cc69ad1529010dfb4\n\nGood day today. I was busy with my daughter and her birthday most of the morning so I wasn’t around to trade until about 1230… hit that morning put scalp on SPX before I left. I came back in right before that massive dump from the Poland news and got burnt on some calls off what looked like a support bounce. After that did a few quick level to level plays but on huge reactions like that I don’t enjoy trading much and I also don’t trade during power hour much anymore besides the occasional too good to be true lotto play. So I was mostly cash. Still a green day but small at that… \n\n**Daily Log-** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9uc4hpf0u70a1.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b52cd9c2c507d1b018c563ceb68dd7c068249e9d\n\nI am very curious to see what the market is going to open at tomorrow. I heard there COULD be an emergency meeting with NATO to discuss more Russia stuff. I don’t know if there will be any further action as the narrative im seeing pushed right now is that it was an accident OR it wasn’t even a missile… we probably will never know the truth. \n\nI did swing some Tesla OTM puts though based on that setup on the daily. I will take profits or take my loss at open pretty much regardless unless im seeing something different on my indicators/ the charts. \n\nThat’s the hardest part about swings is that I get a lot of questions before the market even opens of “are you going to take profits at open?” “you going to take your loss at open?” and honestly until the market opens and until I see exactly what VOLD is doing and the overall moneyflow/ momentum and the DMI stoch and just the actual movement of the candles I have no way to know exactly what the plan is. The only time I for sure can say yes I will close at open is when I know I have a substantial amount of profits OR the move I anticipated clearly isn’t about to play out. \n\nYOUTUBE be up later tonight!')], '2022-11-17': [("When my roommate asks me why I'm buying NVDA back at 160 after selling for a huge loss at 115", "When my roommate asks me why I'm buying NVDA back at 160 after selling for a huge loss at 115"), ('NVDA is expected to have close to 0% revenue growth from their FY 2022 to FY 2023', 'NVDA is expected to have close to 0% revenue growth from their FY 2022 to FY 2023'), ('What price will $SPY close at on 11/23 the day before ThanksGiving?', 'What price will $SPY close at on 11/23 the day before ThanksGiving?&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jnqzkwt0dk0a1.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e5dff450d6e99975a043263df94cc8afda6917d\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/yxzfdx)'), ('50k loss $SPY puts', '50k loss $SPY puts'), ('$TSLA 👑 Huge 1-Year inflection approaching 👑', '$TSLA 👑 Huge 1-Year inflection approaching 👑[removed]'), ('Rest of the Week - what are you positions?', 'Rest of the Week - what are you positions?Currently I am long the dollar, which means I am short equities.

The volatility and unpredictability of trading today was unmatched. I had extreme flash backs to June and July where SPY was so irrational it was untradeable. The pretty extreme low volume (we are 4 mil currently at this moment below the lowest volume day of the year) made for even harder trading today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/im8lk7kgpd1a1.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27eb2cdf258092943a5701d05f273649aec1cdf1\n\nThis is where things continue to perplex me and I continue to struggle with what the fed is trying to do or say. Look at this years CPI YoY forecasts and actual readings. Since July 13th we have not had a single increase in CPI YoY. We have also not had a single CPI YoY forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting. Now we look at CORE CPI YoY and from August until October core was rising, however, last reading core decreased again. \n\nSo we have the fed and mind you they’ve been saying “inflation is not under control” since at least July maybe August. But we are seeing inflation slowing… not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal… but with CPI YoY decreasing and CORE ranging from 5.9 to 6.6% with most of it being 5.9 to 6.3% I feel like there I just something the fed isn’t telling us. Or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound? I mean think about JPOW last FOMC what did he tell us? We was VERY clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature. Which means that almost all the fed members and even JPOW himself knows inflation isn’t under control. \n\nThis next CPI and FOMC meeting will be very interesting to say the least. The case for a huge CPI miss is growing by the minute for me. However, we don’t have any consensus yet (investing.com says forecast but that really the consensus…. There is a TEforecast out but I find that inaccurate). There is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until CPI and FOMC. Which then perhaps CPI misses and FOMC remains bearish and we see this drop hard. \n\nWednesday is FOMC minute day and we should get some more information from JPOW and what the fed members are thinking there. (I will release the FOMC minute trade play to the pre-market section tonight). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfrxzj5hpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=191381b89207ff63d8075f2910dae56ddf47af39\n\nLast week I brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in. However, we are still showing bullish enough moves here. To not short this. \n\nThe bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today (that was interesting) we are still holding that daily 8ema. That support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 394.7 to 398.5. Now mind you I really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 398.5 and actually touch that resistance… but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range. \n\nWe closed yet again another doji on spy too. I am eyeing a possible carrot top (blue lines) formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema. While we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it. \n\nThe issue we have here is this… buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25% of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls. While we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before CPI/ FOMC I feel like no one wants to go long here on calls. However, sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early. \n\nBears aren’t ready to hard sell and bulls don’t want to keep buying. So we are left with this terrible chop. \n\nKey support- 394.7 -&gt; 390.1\n\nKey resistance-398.5 -&gt; 401.3 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/feysfrohpd1a1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97068f6a4b52222fe178cb484f3dc4dbead51708\n\nFutures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart. Futures continues to hold 3960 support and remains under 4000 resistance. Looking at futures I actually see a clearer trend than I do on SPY. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4woaa4ipd1a1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56818a1864ada48fd356d989717ecd5cbe37bdb6\n\nI removed some of my trend lines here to make this look more clear. There is a nice diamond pattern forming here on Futures. This pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down. This pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4dh1vnipd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7488b50427a19e5bfa3253f3bf0b131cbce538fb\n\nOut of curiosity I went back to SPY and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one. Support at 394 and resistance at 397.8 for tomorrow. \n\nBack to futures now.   \n key support- 3960 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3910  \n key resistance- 4000 -&gt; 4028\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0sb8hq6jpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72da651ab80b0384fc70caa16103d40007d66d2f\n\nZooming out here first to show you the Tesla Daily and show you what lines goes where before we zoom in and chat about them. Focus on the bold dark green line here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hy86mnojpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5225f763631b55f413c3dd6bc3e2cb95122ac2fe\n\nNow looking at the zoomed in daily you can see that Tesla actually did break through the daily support line for the green bear channel. This green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel. We are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in December. \n\nInterestingly enough about Tesla here is we have a red falling wedge, a red/ black falling wedge and a blue/ red falling wedge. Now People have been calling for a bounce since 204.8 and since the 234 rejection back on November 1st. \n\nThis is where I struggle as it just seems Tesla cant quite catch a break. Had a bad news day on Friday and then again today (recalls I guess). The question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go? Or is this the easiest short of 2022? \n\nI want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… \n\nSept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   \n Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  \n Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  \n Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  \n Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   \n Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  \n \n\nAverage # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  \n Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  \n Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  \n Average % for the pop= 11.81%  \n \n\nso what does this tell us? \n\nWell being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. \n\nThis also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. \n\nLooking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6ebxazkpd1a1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2a2eda88760c96bf81025455f1a886dc4b406f7\n\nThere was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… \n\nLets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. \n\nThat means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. \n\nTo be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpi4leflpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f9b70d177ac87572352e1dbb896d87c7b3dee7a\n\n**Daily Log-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddjqa6ylpd1a1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c9c19c0d6b703e697bb85085b2781da8363bacf\n\nReally tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. \n\nFrom there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. \n\nA red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. \n\nHOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… \n\nAnyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. \n\nPeople really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. \n\nLong story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them…. Do not be greedy!  \n \n\nYoutube will be up later!  \n \n\nReminder I will NOT be trading tomorrow so no pre-market tomorrow morning and I wont be trading at all tomorrow… busy day with the kids and some other appointments.'), ('at what price does TSLA become tochtoig?', 'at what price does TSLA become tochtoig?[removed]'), ('so where do I stand...', "so where do I stand...Afternoon everyone, \n\nDoing a position review and looking forward to the feedback, I have positions in the following as my disclosure\n\nI've been long John Deere ( DE ) now since 391.73 ... the long term upside is still showing I don't see an issue to 460 and won't be surprised if it goes beyond to 490-ish.

The volatility and unpredictability of trading today was unmatched. I had extreme flash backs to June and July where SPY was so irrational it was untradeable. The pretty extreme low volume (we are 4 mil currently at this moment below the lowest volume day of the year) made for even harder trading today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86i6z821pd1a1.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc2b46bdf3129750ec66e8cd897cd477320f497a\n\nThis is where things continue to perplex me and I continue to struggle with what the fed is trying to do or say. Look at this years CPI YoY forecasts and actual readings. Since July 13th we have not had a single increase in CPI YoY. We have also not had a single CPI YoY forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting. Now we look at CORE CPI YoY and from August until October core was rising, however, last reading core decreased again. \n\nSo we have the fed and mind you they’ve been saying “inflation is not under control” since at least July maybe August. But we are seeing inflation slowing… not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal… but with CPI YoY decreasing and CORE ranging from 5.9 to 6.6% with most of it being 5.9 to 6.3% I feel like there I just something the fed isn’t telling us. Or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound? I mean think about JPOW last FOMC what did he tell us? We was VERY clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature. Which means that almost all the fed members and even JPOW himself knows inflation isn’t under control. \n\nThis next CPI and FOMC meeting will be very interesting to say the least. The case for a huge CPI miss is growing by the minute for me. However, we don’t have any consensus yet (investing.com says forecast but that really the consensus…. There is a TEforecast out but I find that inaccurate). There is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until CPI and FOMC. Which then perhaps CPI misses and FOMC remains bearish and we see this drop hard. \n\nWednesday is FOMC minute day and we should get some more information from JPOW and what the fed members are thinking there. (I will release the FOMC minute trade play to the pre-market section tonight). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5xi71r1pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdd25445934bf30c154e82ccfc8a3e4748237ae2\n\nLast week I brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in. However, we are still showing bullish enough moves here. To not short this. \n\nThe bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today (that was interesting) we are still holding that daily 8ema. That support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 394.7 to 398.5. Now mind you I really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 398.5 and actually touch that resistance… but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range. \n\nWe closed yet again another doji on spy too. I am eyeing a possible carrot top (blue lines) formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema. While we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it. \n\nThe issue we have here is this… buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25% of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls. While we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before CPI/ FOMC I feel like no one wants to go long here on calls. However, sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early. \n\nBears aren’t ready to hard sell and bulls don’t want to keep buying. So we are left with this terrible chop. \n\nKey support- 394.7 -&gt; 390.1\n\nKey resistance-398.5 -&gt; 401.3 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd36vx92pd1a1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=396f25d3cd980dd3b7e8bd4dc9e4a0b67726cee2\n\nFutures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart. Futures continues to hold 3960 support and remains under 4000 resistance. Looking at futures I actually see a clearer trend than I do on SPY. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldx9cvo2pd1a1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=873731cea7a0a60e46380165c67173b12953c78f\n\nI removed some of my trend lines here to make this look more clear. There is a nice diamond pattern forming here on Futures. This pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down. This pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/80xggb73pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64896086e827bf648afbf44f81a6aa1f7095f107\n\nOut of curiosity I went back to SPY and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one. Support at 394 and resistance at 397.8 for tomorrow. \n\nBack to futures now.   \n key support- 3960 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3910  \n key resistance- 4000 -&gt; 4028\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6sf6qwq3pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5b39094fc909d3cd38857b8dc2c5d2f995d8d8e\n\nZooming out here first to show you the Tesla Daily and show you what lines goes where before we zoom in and chat about them. Focus on the bold dark green line here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/04c1k964pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=764039f2470e44c4c265fe2272fe92ba88439d55\n\nNow looking at the zoomed in daily you can see that Tesla actually did break through the daily support line for the green bear channel. This green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel. We are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in December. \n\nInterestingly enough about Tesla here is we have a red falling wedge, a red/ black falling wedge and a blue/ red falling wedge. Now People have been calling for a bounce since 204.8 and since the 234 rejection back on November 1st. \n\nThis is where I struggle as it just seems Tesla cant quite catch a break. Had a bad news day on Friday and then again today (recalls I guess). The question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go? Or is this the easiest short of 2022? \n\nI want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… \n\nSept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   \n Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  \n Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  \n Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  \n Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   \n Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  \n \n\nAverage # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  \n Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  \n Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  \n Average % for the pop= 11.81%  \n \n\nso what does this tell us? \n\nWell being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. \n\nThis also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. \n\nLooking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t9xsyts4pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eff94f8f4eac7e7a71196af9a9f8b3401b61ff1a\n\nThere was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… \n\nLets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. \n\nThat means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. \n\nTo be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkxyvk95pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82cecb10759e894a90da574552d642ae1c4457f7\n\n**Daily Log-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ske2fn5pd1a1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5535b03f194bdbafab71b82160cfedf0760141f3\n\nReally tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. \n\nFrom there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. \n\nA red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. \n\nHOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… \n\nAnyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. \n\nPeople really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. \n\nLong story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them….

Looks like VOLD was behaving nicely today and overall the technical were pretty solid. Kinda sad I missed today but in the end family is always over money/ trading. \n\nTomorrow we get FOMC minutes and while its not guaranteed a big mover or big day this one with the fed pivot narrative and deciding what rate hike for next meeting could bring some good movement. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzqqhu4jel1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=167a8c87e0d955e14f20c3786f769e17f9c4bfe4\n\nQuite a lot going on today technical wise. We did confirm that daily 8ema as support once again and if you remember I had suspected with the doji candle and closure over that key 394.7 support that we would see a bounce today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i03j7jnjel1a1.png?width=788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f0b420fbf1bd2fee7d7535d183b65d11c8e02c2\n\nMy 0dte calls paid out nicely and made it worth missing the whole day today. \n\nNow today we see that we did break through that diamond pattern on SPY daily. This should open us up to some more upside and we also closed over that key 398.5 resistance. The next major support is 401.2 followed by 405.4. With FOMC minutes tomorrow and a lot of fed speakers I really don’t expect much bullish movement and the minutes are going to reconfirm just how hawkish jpow is right now. The keys level we need to watch is 398.5 and 401.2 tomorrow. Those will be our gateways. Also if we do close over 401.2 then we would be closing over the daily 200ema and that really would be a bullish sign. \n\nAt this point there isn’t a big reason to short SPY until we close back under the daily 8ema. But again as I have said going long (think 30-60dte) here also seems like FOMO and chasing. Best thing to do here is to pay the short term. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7d5k748kel1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1f2ddf776549b8a693987ea7cb0e65665af364c\n\nFutures also broke its diamond pattern but instead of showing you that again here I am going to show you this rising wedge that is on futures and SPYs daily chart. This is very key to watch and could lead us to a touch of the 2022 bear market resistance line (the thicker green line) and this could be the pattern to watch to show the next leg down. \n\nWith a closure over 4000 now and breaking the 3955 to 4000 consolidation period we naturally will be looking for the upside here. Key resistance is the daily 200ema at 4028 followed by 4060 and 4090. Key support is now 4010 and 3955. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0capz6qkel1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba4aabadb510fbf98d3ce4a4930292c15c658c29\n\nTesla did make a new low today despite closing green. I posted some analyzed data on tesla with its drops and pops so lets update these now and see what they show…\n\nI want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… \n\nSept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   \n Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  \n Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  \n Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  \n Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   \n Nov 15th (current drop)= 7 day drop -17.2% followed by a ????  \n \n\nAverage # of days for the drop= 6.8 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  \n Average % for the drop= -17.8% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  \n Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  \n Average % for the pop= 11.81%  \n \n\nso what does this tell us? \n\nWith todays new low we are now at day 7 of dropping and -17.2%. We are right at the average length of the drops before we see some upside. \n\nThis also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 166.19 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 185.82 by Tuesday that 29th. \n\nLooking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. \n\nSo again all this show us is that Tesla is following the cycle. With FOMC minutes tomorrow though that could be a wild card but I overall expect some upside on tesla the rest of the week. \n\nOverall 168 to 170 has now built itself as a nice support area here and we could see a push back up tomorrow to test that blue falling wedge resistance at 170. So unless tesla opens red tomorrow and never sees green it will break that blue falling wedge resistance which should provide a push up to at least 175-180. \n\nHowever, if Tesla loses 168 tomorrow then I will be looking for 162.5 which is the red falling wedge support line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yg1z6kzlel1a1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a74aa4ce1ee5690d8a54846320d36ba10ba2b560\n\nThe VIX is still on a mission to break back into the teens it appears. I am a little surprised to not see a slight move up on the VIX today with FOMC minutes tomorrow but perhaps that comes in the morning which does seem to be the trend lately. The VIX also gap filled the August 19th 21.27 gap now (well it hit a low of 21.28 today which is one penny from being gap filled). With the VIX touching 21.3 and dumping even further away form its daily 8ema I would be eyeing 19.7 next which is where the VIX hit in August before the “top” was put in and we started our next leg down. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\nBeing that I was gone all day and had a nice win on my SPY calls I decided not to even attempt to trade anything in the morning before I left. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6flvk0nmel1a1.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2240011acd75d28663bad3f911f482b93fb16763\n\nOverall a green day today and this green day turned my week back to a green week which is always nice.

I felt a little off earlier in the week and struggled but today I ended on a good note. I had one swing play that closed red today (IV crush was wild today) but other then that I had 3 scalps for 100% win rate and had 4 level to levels for a 100% win rate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x681soymt52a1.png?width=234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbb14c63470eb2077f5fc14aac206e6a2e2fea74\n\nSpy had the tightest range day I have ever seen it had not even breaking a full $2 move and we also saw IV in the teens and even hit single digits EOD.

While the actual IV % hasn’t really been too helpful trend wise we are seeing though that when the IV rank hits these levels is when we have typically seen the peak put in. this also is correlating well with us closing in on that 2022 bear market resistance line which on the weekly time frame has us right around 410 for next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7s2dwxnt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e618ec5bdc747a7776531bce5288bed48b9824\n\nWhen we look at the daily chart here we can see we have put in some pretty stout resistance right there at 402.4 with two candle bodies rejecting it and the November 15th wick hitting that level too. \n\nThis is our key level until we close over this level I am going to start looking for a retrace. There is a pretty good chance come Monday that we see that blue rising wedge support broken. We need to see SPY open over 402.4 and hold it all day otherwise that rising wedge is broken and I will expect a retrace. However, if we can hold that support then I don’t see a reason why we don’t touch that 405.2 channel resistance. \n\nThe daily candle while small is technically a gravestone doji with a double top, however, due to the short day today and the overall low IV I wanted to wait till Monday to act on this. I don’t trust this shorten day to make a full play on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/auuiangot52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e21b119ee6783f38450e01968746795d27831c9\n\nPretty similar picture here on the weekly. Unless we open over 403.3 and hold that support all week we break the weekly support and will see a sell off back to the 390 to 398 range. \n\nIf the weekly can find support and a green open I will look for 408.9 channel resistance and then the bear market resistance line is that 410 as I mentioned earlier. \n\nInterestingly enough this is actually the first back to back green months that SPY has put in all year and the first back to back green months since July/ August 2021. \n\nI am going to watch this weekly rising wedge closely and watch that 410 bear resistance closely. I did decide to sit cash all weekend so that I could see what Monday brought and while I note IV is the lowest it has been in months I wasn’t quite willing to take a risk on a play over the weekend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22aim3yot52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=053a2d2d1e7fe783e2db3ea1bb477dfe451631a1\n\nMuch of the same here on Futures as we did back test and hold that daily 20ema finishing with a doji here. However, on Futures you can see that it actually turned 4033 previous resistance into support with 4050 being the next resistance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pxppuaept52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9091c7f73793367946c6a6a6549a3b2082f5443d\n\nIt is a little hard to tell but on the Futures weekly this week DID fail to make a new high. Last week touched 4050.75 and this week saw a high of 4049.25. With the weekly 50ema clearly being resistance this is going to be our key level to watch next week of 4050. However, we have found really nice support on the weekly 20ema down near 3925. \n\nThat blue rising wedge support line sits at 4050 and unless we open and hold that then we should expect a retrace next week. \n\nBear market resistance for futures weekly sits at 4120 for next week with key level resistance at 4085.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ne3c8zpt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee284393c0f81ac4f792f0dea2d56eba4c7b69e\n\nSo looking ahead to next week… we got some gnarly data coming out AND we got JPOW speaking at 130pm Wednesday where he WILL be answering questions. Honestly with this economic data lineup I would not be surprised to see a choppy Monday/ Tuesday (maybe slightly green) and see a pretty large sell off the rest of the week. \n\nLooking at tesla it was once again the victim. Having yet again another large pre market that by open was miniscule and led to a red day. This may be the third or 4th time in the last two weeks I have seen this happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98ttt3lqt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8baa5ded2708a51d68c34a5d8e1d785f38c89af\n\nI posted this analysis of Tesla and its history of drops followed by pops since September. Well we are at day 3 of the pop and we are looking at about a 11.7% move from that bottom to current HOD. That’s pretty damn close to the average 4.2 day pop of 11.81%. \n\nI actually was pretty tempted to play puts on Tesla due to this trend but I did want to wait out Monday. I am seeing a nice double top right at 185.2 resistance. However, with Tesla holding the daily 8ema and still holding that green support line I was more nervous to jump into puts. There is a chance this pop could last another day or two and we could see a test of the daily 20ema near 192.5 Monday or of the red falling wedge resistance at 190.1 Monday. However, unless Tesla opens green and holds 185.2 Monday then we should break support line and I will be looking at the next leg down. \n\nHistorically speaking… we should look for about a 7day drop of 17.8%... so assuming that today was the top that means by December 6th we should look for a drop to about 152.2. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2r2rn16rt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39f978f535ead6ae4cb9800b78ae1d3e72dc5361\n\nLooking at Tesla falling wedge and the support line of that for December 6th that would give us a support bounce of about 150.6, however, if you look at this previous drop we did not touch the support line completely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmbbqjmrt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4fbb644d301cbccbb44076501172bc8a532d386\n\nTesla weekly did break through the red bear channel resistance. This is the resistance if we use support from the October 3rd and 10th weekly candles and project it to the peak of the October 31st candle. However, there is also a blue bear channel using the peak of September 19th and October 31st candles. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7nkv04st52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d18513a39dc8d9ff04be246612f0d1f6ed732b9\n\nIt would then make our weekly chart look like this. I personally put far more weight into the blue bear channel than I do the red bear channel. That would mean we actually did not break through resistance and have resistance pegged at that magical 185.3 level next week. If Tesla holds under that level all week then that is a rejection of the bear channel and should bring more down side. I am seeing a bullish reversal dragonfly doji candle formed here, however, we DID fail to close back over the daily 200ema. This daily 200ema next week could act as resistance and form a double top which would lead to further downside. \n\nKey support- 166.4 -&gt; 154.2\n\nKey resistance- 192.9 -&gt; 207.2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bo36u9ptt52a1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef8ba1b78bc7c3e30c79e1926b9e943141d926dd\n\nThe VIX is finally nearing that danger zone. That lower red highlighted channel of 19.7 to 16.5. Every time a “peak” on SPY has been put in the VIX has broken under 19.7 or touched it first. \n\nI am really eyeing a case of VIX touching 19.7 or below Monday or Tuesday this week with SPY rejecting 405-410 area and then come Wednesday through Friday we see a pretty large drop due to JPOW and the economic data coming out. \n\n**$5k/10% challenge-** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og005m4ut52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5735a8738ed1fdd0aa063b6f671d5fa4a1c45cc\n\nAnother week of green here on the Challenge closing out with a net profit of $980 this week and total profits over the two weeks ive been running this challenge of $1740. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\nUnfortunately I struggled this week quite a bit. However, my biggest losses came from once again holding too long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfisi5tut52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20de760d00def936f1d3ec68e15ae7538cc88422\n\nLooking at my weekly analysis here I actually impressively hit 100% win rate on all my SPY scalps this week. Had a pretty mild profit between the normal scalps/ $5k scalps of $1980 this week. I only scalped a total of 7 times this week with 3 of those coming from today. I just didn’t see a lot of good setups this week for scalps and struggled finding a good read on the technical earlier in the week. \n\nLooking at my level to level plays this is actually the first week I believe in about 7 weeks of playing level to level/ swings that I have close out my week red for strictly the level to level plays. The biggest mistake this week was my stop losses on those. I started the week off with a pretty large -50% loss on Tesla. It had popped from about -40% to -25% and then immediately to -50% before I could really do much on a massive drop. I also took a put on FOMC minute day to -78% that had I mitigated my loss properly at -20% or the -5% right before minutes I would have actually ended my week green. I as I had said was FAR too bearish for FOMC minutes (which I think come Wednesday when JPOW speaks im going to find out I was right but market didn’t react that way) and burnt myself. \n\nI also took a pretty large loss on a SPX call overnight last night. I have not seen the IV crush the way it did on SPX/ SPY overnight. I know we had the holiday and everything but for SPY opening barely down 0.1% I believe it was and for my strike being the first strike OTM I was extremely shocked to see my position open -65%. I was able to get out around -60% but that one hurt a lot. I don’t think anyone who played anything (unless they sold options) won with a swing today. \n\nMorale of the story is I let my losers run more than I let me winners run. This week I failed to properly mitigate my losses and that was a big mistake and one I will continue to learn from next week. \n\nOverall closing out the week at a total -$594 which is not bad in all reality but it is still my first red week since the week of September 12th. Looking to get back on a good track Monday and get back on that green gain train. \n\nI hope everyone has a great weekend! \n\nI will have YOUTUBE up later tonight or tomorrow (got some people doing work at the house and don’t have quiet time to make the video).'), ('Look at chart of TD blocking trades.', 'Look at chart of TD blocking trades.Why is WSB censoring this content?

It is something that has been mentioned by both Morgan Stanley's CIO Michael Wilson and Stanley Druckenmiller as a indicator to watch. \n\nTo calculate it you take the Fed's Balance Sheet (Total Assets) minus the sum of the Treasury General Account (TGA) and Reverse Repos (RRP). To put it in a overly simple way, the TGA and RRP are both essentially deposits and thus a liability so by subtracting it from the Fed's total assets, you get the money that is available to circulate. \n\n* Net Liquidity = Fed Total Assets - (TGA + RRP)\n\nNow remember the Fed is currently on a path of Quantitative Tightening (QT) and has announced plans to shrink the size of their balance sheet. In effect, this means their Total Assets should run down over time. \n\n**Net Liquidity and the S&amp;P 500**\n\nLets start off with this [chart](https://i.imgur.com/fbr5gBD.png). In this, we put together 10 years of Net Liquidity against the S&amp;P 500. \n\nYou can see that starting in 2020, they have begun marching in lockstep against one another. \n\nHere is a closer view over the last 2-3 [years](https://i.imgur.com/HrEet1Q.png). \n\nHere is a great visual from [Max Anderson](https://i.imgur.com/qklnh1m.png). \n\nConsidering the size of market returns in recent years and given the amount of money the Fed has injected through the TGA and RRP, it makes perfect sense that the amount of money injected should have an impact on asset prices as the sheer amount of liquidity dictates how high assets can rise. In that light, its clear there should be a relationship between the level of liquidity and the total value of the market. \n\nIf this correlation remains consistent, the Fed's stated plans for QT will continue to weigh on the equity markets as Net Liquidity further shrinks. In fact, current expectations see another $350B of removal over the next eight weeks and odds are that the Fed will continue to run down their Assets in 2023. This could push SPY significantly lower from where we are at today. \n\n**How to play this?**\n\nBuy puts, short growth, discretionary, materials, industrials\n\n**Risks?**\n\nPossible the correlation can break down. Maybe its all bullshit, but the rationale makes sense.\n\n[Read it straight from the source.](https://twitter.com/maxjanderson/status/1546473237491716096)"), ('Wanting to Start Brownhole Capital', 'Wanting to Start Brownhole CapitalHey community. \n\nThinking of creating a fund that working-class Americans would be able to invest in. 3X leveraged SPY positions obviously, 40% a year.

I should have played weekend swing puts but I was happy to sit cash as the weekends are pretty unpredictable as of late. \n\nBear case- today we opened red and attempted to retake the daily 200ema however was unable to, we broke the 3+ week long daily rising wedge pattern and we closed below the daily 8ema for the first time since the day before CPI. \n\nBull case- despite the rejection and closing under the daily 8 and 200ema we did bounce pretty hard off the key support range of 395 to 395.5 today. We are still maintaining that key lower support range of this consolidation pattern that SPY has been in since November 11th. \n\nFor me this breakdown shows that we have a potential to retest 390.1 support and potentially even lower depending on what JPOW says on Wednesday and depending on what all the economic data comes in at. I am bearish until we touch 390.1… If we touch and bounce off 390.1 again then I am seeing a nice consolidation channel from 390.1 to 402.5 and will play it at such. However if we break through and close under 390.1 then I am looking for at minimum the gap fill at 381.2. \n\nKey support- 396 -&gt; 392.6 -&gt; 390.1\n\nKey resistance- 399.2 -&gt; 402.4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yg2o8cigr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7777e1ba5e61d8807db2c0425b639b37064fc223\n\nMuch of the same case here on futures breaking that rising wedge. However, futures is still holding over one of the key support levels of 3970. If we see futures lose 3955 then I would feel confident in a 3910 retest of support. However, if futures can break back over 4000 we can start talking about a retest of 4020 and then 4040.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v7aupuigr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f55ad1ead9b49c0b10d8422a4714ce3f91b96ae\n\nTesla has the biggest bearish case of them all in my opinion when we look at the daily chart. We had that green support line that was 3 days long until today. That line was broke through today we also failed to even reach the falling wedge resistance line before we retraced. With this gravestone doji closing at Fridays candle body support of 182.9 this should open up some pretty large downside tomorrow.

However if we play out the % drop of 17.82% but not the number of days it took to get there we could see by November 30th (2 days) a touch of the red support line at 154.5. \n\nRealistically I would look for a test of support near 148-155 in the next 4-7 trading days. Biggest support to break through though will be that 166.2 level. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nb5x4lckgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060a5fcfcccf160399b111c5fc56bbba73474559\n\nI don’t love post weekly charts so early in the week but we did break through the blue resistance line of this current downward trend today. However we immediately rejected and hard rejected off the weekly 200ema. Key support for this weekly timeframe is 180.1. This current bear channel (thick red support line) gives us intraweek support of 154 and next week support of 152. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1ypnmtngr2a1.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b49e2fa1fe3ece40f4c34f686445047bba1158d\n\nAs much as I was looking for that 19.7 touch this week it appears that as of now we may not get it. We officially closed over the daily 8ema for the first time since October 14th. We are still in this bear channel though and its not quite time to get super excited but this is not a bad time in my opinion to start adding to some 30-60dte put positions. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ur18t0hlgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dccb7cb11673a4f1a2eacd4b6a306c09af6f1a16\n\nWas able to get a nice put scalp in this morning for the $5k challenge. Still haven’t quite been able to get any good big scalp wins but I also don’t want to stretch these plays out. This is one of those times where if I had a standard position size (usually $2000 for me) I would sometimes hold a little longer but with this larger bigger $5000 position I am more apt to quickly take profits and to take the first hit of profits. \n\nThis is where the emotional side of trading comes in. \n\n**Daily log-** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3x7gr0mgr2a1.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fccc2d95e2b22ee3d56cf1fc1318c5927a1e027\n\nOverall not a bad day and a great way to start the week off. Almost love starting the week off with a nice green day. Scalps were on fire today even if I closed them all early AF only for them all to 3-4x right after… but profit is profit! \n\nSome struggles with the level to level plays this morning. The first SPY put I played the bounce off 399.2 support however it was a fake bounce and broke down pretty quickly and I got out. I was just unfortunately too early on that first Tesla put and got stopped out before it saw green. \n\nNot a bad day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1angqsjmgr2a1.png?width=856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daeeb4c22ae758cb2fb6545bcde799f7e319c9e8\n\nLooks like a lot of you found green today too! \n\nHope you guys had a great day!

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. \n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons? I only see words. \n   * Click the links above.\n* Have you back-tested this?\n   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)\n* What is the historical performance?\n   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%.

However, I said unless we get a new volatility support level we should expect a break down to 176.7. But we saw a 182.5 support level come in and now we should look for 182.5 to 184.8 to be our new magnet on Tesla. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iliq166pky2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7f61f43eb7d927a5d3cc68fb662e22e7cb9e99d\n\nMy intentions today was to play puts overnight for the economic data and JPOW speech tomorrow however, I saw too much of a bullish case on SPY to warrant puts overnight. I considered a straddle but im not sure if we will get a big enough movement to make it worth the capital risked. \n\nWe saw the daily 8ema confirmed as resistance and we broke down o that key 393.7 support level (from the 15min volatility) and that’s as low as we went today. With that EOD recovery and closure back over 395.2 we are actually seeing a potential that we are still trading within that same 395.2 to 399.2 area that we have been trading in for the last 2 weeks. \n\nThis doji after 3 red days could set us up with that 395.2 closure for a move back towards 399.2 tomorrow. However, if this economic data comes in rough and depending on what JPOW says tomorrow at 130pm we really could see 390 or we could see 402.5 tomorrow. I don’t have a strong feeling either way besides I think JPOW continues to be far more bearish than the markets want to believe. \n\nSupport- 395.2 -&gt; 392.6 -&gt; 390.1\n\nResistance- 399.2 -&gt; 402.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2y9sbaopky2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=155e7c2376c1f651461d523ba2bde36ef72b5137\n\nFutures with a similar break down but held its 3955 support level from the last two weeks very nicely. We have now had 6 attempts to close below 3955 over the last 12 trading days and all have failed. Until we see 3955 support break and we close below that I do struggle to believe in a bigger bear case. \n\nSupport- 3955 -&gt; 3935 -&gt; 3910\n\nResistance- 4020 -&gt; 4040\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qcp1v28qky2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82910c2fdff5918e6b33ca72feb9b61a279642e5\n\nTesla is a tough one here as I really do see a bear case and a bull case. \n\nFor the bear case we rejected at 185.2 for the 2nd day in the last 3 trading days. This is the 5th rejection at 185.2 in the last 8 trading days. As you can see highlighted in blue we are in this overall bull channel here but we are rejecting at the bigger macro falling wedge here in red. This is our 2nd day of rejecting the falling wedge resistance without breaking through. \n\nHowever for the bull case we attempted and for a while we were looking like we would break through 180 support and close below that which would have resulted in a bearish engulfing daily candle. Despite the closure below the daily 8ema failure to have a meaningful sell off today and to lose that key 180 support does open more upside. \n\nKey support- 180 -&gt; 173.6\n\nKey resistance- 185.1 -&gt; 190.8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxchwzzrky2a1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a67b9c3b3cba5b9c6aee9b093851208d9ce5a7ab\n\nThe VIX did a whole lot of nothing today. Holding within yesterdays range pretty much all day but it did close below its daily 8ema support again. The VIX does not really give us any sort of direction either. These 3 dojis in a row show indecision in the market and show that we very well could with todays gravestone doji see the VIX unwind tomorrow and look to gap fill at 21.11. However, with JPOW speech tomorrow and with all the economic data tomorrow we very well could see the VIX move up and possibly even touch that bear channel resistance at 22.7 tomorrow. However, in order to be full bear I would like to see a closure over the daily 20ema which should be near 23.61 tomorrow. 23.6 also happens to be our lower channel resistance level too.

We are due for NFP and most importantly unemployment rates.. the last two times we have had unemployment rates we have had MASSIVE market moves… \n\nNovember 4th previous was 3.5% and we got 3.7% and markets opened 1.2% green. On October 7th we had a previous rate of 3.7% and got 3.5% and markets opened -1.2%... So we should expect a pretty good sized move tomorrow morning based on these numbers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whpk6v6rnd3a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a67449c314d0b3b1feea0523fa6653ededae2a1\n\nAs you can see we broke through the 2022 bear market resistance line (dark green). That is a big deal! However, from the moment we opened over it that was about all we ever saw of those levels. We have now formed two rising wedges on the daily chart too and established 408.8 as key resistance. \n\nWe did come back down and retest 405.2 support and did hold it. With this support test we should expect an upside push on SPY, however, today was far from bulls being in control. I wouldn’t be surprised if we broke through 390.2 tomorrow and can back down to retest 402.5 tomorrow or next week. However, if we break out over that 408.8 level I do believe we test 420 next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/egeb4lnrnd3a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad4a3854975458a3d028b9c3dabdb5ac9dbe6fd5\n\nFutures still is rejecting that key 4095 level. This gives me more bearish vibes than the SPY daily chart does with these doji candles. I am eyeing as long as 4095 is resistance that we could come back down for a retest of 4020 or 4040 support. \n\nHowever, once we take out 4095 we have a pretty big opening to run to 4200. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ovhmib3snd3a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4834b7f5c24609d7b58557da0525455f66875c31\n\nTesla today pushed through and retested key 197 resistance from November 7th and had a really nice rejection there. IT did hold yesterdays support of 194.5 support EOD. We also closed our first full candle over the daily 20ema since September 21st… which was the day of the sell off. \n\nThe one thing I am eyeing on Tesla is a massive rejection here and a breakdown tomorrow. If you look at the trends on Teslas daily chart almost any time it breaks over the daily 20ema or touches it the next day is heavily red. \n\nIf Tesla breaks through 197 tomorrow then we should see a breakout to 205 to 210 area. However if this was the top of this red channel we could be looking for a break down back to at least 180. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4g4dh4tnd3a1.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=335e26f5b5631dae2bcb00856f1233afe63d4c31\n\nThe VIX continues to unwind and despite this red day on SPY we are finally seeing the VIX near 19.7 levels. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5p73zmtnd3a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a3ea6cf9e036c54fd6c59a1c9b65091567bbedf\n\nWith Spy breaking through the bear market resistance line, the FG hitting 70 today which is the highest level all year and SPY breaking through its bear market resistance line… this could be the best area to start loading some 60-90dte puts ATM. The premium is going to be really cheap right now while VIX is so low and IV is low… We very well as I said could push to 420… so I would start small maybe 10-20% of your desired position size. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5ah3c4und3a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de7481c8368f2e26d0051fd4183b1ec110e7822b\n\nFinally was able to secure a bigger win on my $5k challenge play. Overall a GREAT week there for sure. \n\n**Daily Log-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3e8o8jund3a1.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a15fee286f9abcada1349b7ea120ab163cccf33a\n\nI had played a half sized 0dte put overnight. I was actually extremely surprised to open at only -40% and when it slightly push my way I took my exit. I thought that would be a great risk management loss but had I held a little longer and played the move back to my 407.8 magnet then I woulda closed around 50-60%. \n\nScalps and even l2l plays were fire today! I have not seen premiums pay as well as they did today in a very long time. I played 4dte for all of my SPY L2L today and the premiums were move extremely favorable. I stopped myself out of that call at -7% because I expected a bigger breakdown and thought I would get stopped out so I exited early… I watched it all the way down and I never woulda broke my -20% stop loss had I held and it woulda gone on to be very profitable too. \n\nOverall a pretty great day. I did take small wins on almost all of my L2L plays only to watch them double or triple pretty much instantly after I exited. But I am super happy with profits and with the day overall. Been a great week so far!\n\nYOUTUBE WILL BE UP LATER'), ('What is your theory on why so many finance professionals and experts are coming out and saying that a recession is going to happen?', "What is your theory on why so many finance professionals and experts are coming out and saying that a recession is going to happen?I'm **not** asking if these people are right or wrong.
