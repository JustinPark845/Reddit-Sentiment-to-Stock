It is called KASLR.  This is effective; but at a cost.  A 30-40% performance cost.  Almost all large data/cloud providers (Amazon, Google, etc.) use Intel chips.  \n\nPeople suspect this is because it's *rumored* a bug exists in the Intel CPUs that allow code to be run across multiple virtual machines on the same host.  A HUGE security vulnerability.  Think, Joe the hacker opening an AWS account and accessing all data on that machine (or even network) completely unrestricted.\n\nI would expect AMD to move upwards heavily on this rumor.\n\nI mean, no sane company would halve the performance of their product without GREAT reason.  And AMD is not doing this.\n\nEDIT: Found this comment in the Linux Kernel here: \n&gt;+\t/* Assume for now that ALL x86 CPUs are insecure */\n&gt;+\tsetup_force_cpu_bug(X86_BUG_CPU_INSECURE);"), ('Buy AMD Now!', 'Buy AMD Now!CES 2018 is in two weeks, and as per usual AMD will most likely announce new product lines.'), ('Year of the AMD', 'Year of the AMD'), ('MU or AMD?', 'MU or AMD?Investing $1000 tomorrow.'), ('Intel with AMD graphics', 'Intel with AMD graphics'), ('MU or AMD?', 'MU or AMD?Investing $1000 tomorrow.')], '2018-01-03': [('NVDA and TSLA Merger!!

This is it.', "My final DD for AAPL. This is it.Let's weigh in the con and pros arguments for why AAPL will beat estimates and guide higher.\nnote: **I have been wrong 3/4 last predictions so please inverse me**\n\n\n\n**Cons**:\n\nLet's start with the facts. Broadcom, TI and Qualcomm reported earnings stating that expectations for modems have tapered recently due to the iphone. Please see QCOM's latest transcript here:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/top-iphone-suppliers-warn-of-slower-sales-ahead-of-apple-results?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_campaign=headline&amp;cmpId=yhoo.headline&amp;yptr=yahoo\n\nSamsung also gave cautious guidance to OLED for mobile for 2018. In their CC, Samsung reported **23%** lower revenue than guidance for OLED for mobile phones.\n\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Poor-iPhone-X-sales-weigh-down-Samsung-s-Oct.-Dec.-results\n\nFurthermore, China mobile sales were very weak as compared to other years.\nhttps://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/MediaTek-expects-headwinds-in-China-mobile-market-in-2018\n\n\n\n\n\n**Pros:**\n1) \nThe bloomberg article did not mention that Apple is now using intel modems (https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/31/apple-inc-may-have-wanted-to-use-intel-corps-modem.aspx). \n(https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/01/qualcomm-iphone-x-still-faster-than-intel/)\nIn fact during intel's CC, they've reported a huge growth in their mobile business unit.\n\n2) \nThe Korean Won was very strong this quarter due to bank of korea raising rates and growing peace between North and South. This headwind can account for 5% of the 23% lower revenue in OLED for mobile. Furthermore, we don't know exactly how much of the OLED goes to Apple although Samsung has exclusive rights to make the OLEDs for the Iphone X. \n\nCautious guidance can be explained by other OLED mfgs such as LG's.\n\nTherefore, it is my conclusion that Iphone X sales (in units) have moderated about 10%, but not as bad as other analysts have predicted. However, in revenue ($ USD) due to the weak dollar, Apple may have in fact beaten guidance despite the lukewarm sales.  \n\n3) \nLatest Foxconn sales have shown a huge increase in revenue. Mark Hibben (Seeking Alpha) attributes the growth to the Iphone X sales solely.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZXL1b8o.png\n\n4) Apple's services will grow by more than 20% YoY. This is where the real growth is coming from. http://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/apple-siri-now-active-500m-devices/\n\n5) Taxes and the 350B spending spree. This is self-explanatory. I believe that Apple has been using this quarter as an experimental period where they want to take the next GIANT leap in progress - just like what Mark Zuckerberg has done. They both know that they can get away with it - which is totally fair. Please see my previous post to cite for your research: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7txxw7/isnt_it_to_apples_benefit_to_lower_aapl_to/\n   \n\n\n6) Qorvo, an Apple supplier, has seen a bit weaker revenue but expects encouraging growth in later half of 2018:\n\n\n\n7) TSMC reported 10nm revenue in the 2 consecutive quarters of 2.55E9  USD. Since virtually all 10nm goes to Apple at the moment, we see 2.55E9/($26 cost for A11)*1E-6 &lt;= (upper bound) 98M IPhone X sold. Although this is an upper bound, this is way way higher than the estimates calling for 15-20M.\n\n*With Apple’s softer holiday sell-through being well reported over the past several weeks and QRVO’s stock already having declined about 20% from its highs in November, investors look to have already largely factored in QRVO’s lighter guidance, with the company’s shares remaining relatively flat in after-hours trading.\nAlso likely helping to support QRVO’s share price is its indication of “recent developments with mid/high-band PADs and Phase 6 design wins”, which include mid/high-band and low-band integrated PAD modules.  The company also sampled a custom mid/high-band PAD to an additional tier-one smartphone OEM. These mid/high-band PAD are significant as it has been the lack of high-performance BAW filter shipments that have recently weighed on its gross margins, particularly as it previously earned a high volume low-band PAD design with its largest customer that used SAW filters instead of the firm’s BAW designs.\nUpdate: The stock has now staged quite an impressive turnaround, surging by $6.43, or almost 9%, at $78.20, and at one point almost 10% higher this evening. One thing that may be helping the company are remarks by management on the call that later this year, it expects to see the biggest-ever content gains in Apple products that it has ever seen for its wireless parts.**\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/qorvo-stock-already-reflects-weak-apple-results-says-drexel-1517437350?mod=hp_RTA&amp;\n\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**:  Analysts have been deceptively scooping your shares, and Apple is using this time to experiment and take the risks needed to still be innovative in an era where value and growth are perceived to not go hand in hand.\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer: I am long (and all in on): NVDA, MU, AAPL, AMZN, AMAT, LRCX, MU, MU (not in any particular order). **\n\nEDIT SEE TSMC BOM CALCULATION\n\nEDIT: also am long AMD"), ('Who else HYPED for $TSLA earnings next week.

I guess at 4:14 or 4:15 before the option expired SPY must've dipped below 266.50 because I woke up the next morning before the market opened and saw my balance was up about $140k. I thought it was a glitch with the Etrade app at first but then looked at my portfolio and saw what happened. For some reason I was assigned only 863 of the 1000 put contracts I sold. That's 86,300 shares of SPY which is about $23,000,000 worth. I only had $50,000 in my account so I started panicking and wondering if Etrade would liquidate my account or something, so I put in a limit order of 268 (SPY was trading around 268.12 at the time), hoping the sale would go through immediately. After putting in the order a message popped up saying my order would be put through when the market opened, which I don't understand because I thought you could buy and sell stocks/ETFs during premarket hours. So anyway I was stuck staring at my phone's screen until 9:30 when the market opened. Immediately about half my shares sold for $268 each. The market seemed to be dropping so I lowered my limit for the rest to 267.60 and the rest of them sold for that price. After all that my balance was about $112k higher than it was yesterday.

I guess at 4:14 or 4:15 before the option expired SPY must've dipped below 266.50 because I woke up the next morning before the market opened and saw my balance was up about $140k. I thought it was a glitch with the Etrade app at first but then looked at my portfolio and saw what happened. For some reason I was assigned only 863 of the 1000 put contracts I sold. That's 86,300 shares of SPY which is about $23,000,000 worth. I only had $50,000 in my account so I started panicking and wondering if Etrade would liquidate my account or something, so I put in a limit order of 268 (SPY was trading around 268.12 at the time), hoping the sale would go through immediately. After putting in the order a message popped up saying my order would be put through when the market opened, which I don't understand because I thought you could buy and sell stocks/ETFs during premarket hours. So anyway I was stuck staring at my phone's screen until 9:30 when the market opened. Immediately about half my shares sold for $268 each. The market seemed to be dropping so I lowered my limit for the rest to 267.60 and the rest of them sold for that price. After all that my balance was about $112k higher than it was yesterday. Does anyone know how much interest Etrade will charge me for holding 23 million dollars of SPY for these few hours?\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/onEjU"), ('$NVDA EARNINGS THREAD: NVIDIA Reports Q4 Adj.

Mothafuckin, "untouchable" JD. Not one green day this week, as it plummeted as low as 15% this week before stabilizing at -10% as CEO Liu bent over for Papa Ma, as disclosed in the sexual assault SEC filing it shared with investors. Closing the week at a very distant $43.78. \n\nSQ whiplashed left and right, holding third until JD tanked. Falling to 43 after earnings and then spiking to 48 for like 5 min, SQ ended up stabilizing at 46, where it closed the week. High PE? Perhaps, but who gives a fuck. Stocks only go up, anyways. My barber started taking SQ and he\'s 85 years old, time to go all in. \n\nAnd let\'s show some love for BIG PAPA SANJAY. MU climbing 5% on the week before tanking on that orange faggot\'s steel semi-boner and regaining it all at close of week, only 60 cents or so from our prior meme high. MU IS NOW COMFORTABLY IN FIRST. \n\nThe race stalled somewhat this week, but props to MU for staring the red market in the eye and shitting dollar bills throughout (MU\'s market maker must be colorblind, but we\'ll let the poor autist believe he earned his position instead of being offered it out of pity - GS already hired the special needs quants and they had a quota to fill). \n\nPer last week\'s popular request, ROKU has been added to the meme race. IDK why the fuck why, because the tards who voted to add roku as a late entry last week (I\'m looking at you u/avgazn247 &amp; u/Brunoob) must have been looking at its chart upside down. Down 10% this week and rumor has it the new Roku Premiere+ will come packaged with dildos so they can continue fucking themselves.  \n\nINTC has been dropped as it isn\'t a meme stock and technically  already won. Who the fuck wants to watch Usain race a group of quadriplegics? (lowkey I would anyways..... I\'ll take the 1:10000000 odds on Stephen Hawking in case Bolt sprains his ankle)\n\nLast I heard, AMD was giving Kimmy Jong Un\'s little pencil wiwi a blowy in the stadium bathroom but it may have been a north korean choir boy, idk they all have the same haircut. \n\nAll in all, an interesting week. My account closed up $144, a staggering 0.31% , holding a weak AB (Ally Bank) Coefficient of 0.20 (0.3% / 1.5%).

I have seen some interpret this number as an intentional exaggeration based on the fact that Musk later specified the initiation of deliveries on July 1st as "an impossible date". The two factors are easy to separate, though, if you look further down in the transcript. \n\n Musk says,  \n&gt;  "I feel confident about the topline number, but the mix internally, it is difficult to figure that out. Maybe it\'s something like 100,000 to 150,000 S and X, and then maybe 300,000 to 400,000 of 3, I don\'t know. It\'s really hard to say." \n\n Musk was obviously incredibly confident in a figure in the ballpark of a third of a million by the end of 2018, so it\'s reasonable to extrapolate that at the very least, 10% of that should have been done in 2017-even if factoring for the frequently mentioned "production ramp", which Tesla can never seem to get a hold of. We\'ll see if they can find the traction necessary to make it a reality. \n\n Tesla has actually been sued [over the matter of failure in Model 3 production readiness](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/31/technology/tesla-shareholder-suit-model-3/index.html). They mentioned it themselves in their [Q3 2017 report](http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1564590-17-21343&amp;CIK=1318605): \n\n &gt; On October 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its current officers and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May 4, 2016 to October 6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made materially false and misleading statements regarding its preparedness to produce Model 3 vehicles. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\n\n I haven\'t seen any update on the case\'s progress but would update this if anyone has info.\n\n***\n\n***\n\nI\'m going to add a component to this which I feel is necessary because oftentimes when I see a post/comment which highlights Tesla\'s inability to meet goals and/or deadlines, a Tesla fan (or investor) comes forward and questions its significance within the overall market - usually against automotive competitors.\n\nSo, I\'ll compare projections for the Model 3 against the Bolt since those are both in the 200+ mile range EV segment.\n\nI checked various investor materials from both companies\' going back into 2012 and coming forward to 2017. In addition, I checked media reports for general events. Here is when each company made projections of availability for the respective segment entry, when revisions occurred, and the actuality:\n\n***\n\nYear|Tesla|GM\n:--:|:--|:--\n2015 | ["..our goal is to introduce the Model 3, a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market, in 2017."](http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1564590-15-1031&amp;CIK=1318605) | [Official debut](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2015/01/naias-2015-chevrolet-bolt-ev-debuts/): "The $30,000 EV crossover concept boasts a range of 200 miles"\n2016 | [Official debut](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/31/11335272/tesla-model-3-announced-price-release-date-specs-preorder): "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the car will deliver at least 215 miles of range beginning at just $35,000"| ["The Bolt EV will be an all-electric vehicle when it goes into production at our Orion Assembly plant in late 2016...](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=231169&amp;p=irol-secTextTest&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2FwaS50ZW5rd2l6YXJkLmNvbS9maWxpbmcueG1sP2lwYWdlPTEwNzA4NjE4JkRTRVE9MCZTRVE9MCZTUURFU0M9U0VDVElPTl9FTlRJUkUmc3Vic2lkPTU3)\n2016 | [(May earnings call transcript, Musk speaking)](https://s.t.st/media/xtranscript/2016/Q2/13559022.pdf): "So as a rough guess, I would say we would aim to produce 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s in the second half of [2017].

I have seen some interpret this number as an intentional exaggeration based on the fact that Musk later specified the initiation of deliveries on July 1st as "an impossible date". The two factors are easy to separate, though, if you look further down in the transcript. \n\n Musk says,  \n&gt;  "I feel confident about the topline number, but the mix internally, it is difficult to figure that out. Maybe it\'s something like 100,000 to 150,000 S and X, and then maybe 300,000 to 400,000 of 3, I don\'t know. It\'s really hard to say." \n\n Musk was obviously incredibly confident in a figure in the ballpark of a third of a million by the end of 2018, so it\'s reasonable to extrapolate that at the very least, 10% of that should have been done in 2017-even if factoring for the frequently mentioned "production ramp", which Tesla can never seem to get a hold of. We\'ll see if they can find the traction necessary to make it a reality. \n\n Tesla has actually been sued [over the matter of failure in Model 3 production readiness](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/31/technology/tesla-shareholder-suit-model-3/index.html). They mentioned it themselves in their [Q3 2017 report](http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1564590-17-21343&amp;CIK=1318605): \n\n &gt; On October 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its current officers and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May 4, 2016 to October 6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made materially false and misleading statements regarding its preparedness to produce Model 3 vehicles. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.\n\n I haven\'t seen any update on the case\'s progress but would update this if anyone has info.\n\n***\n\n***\n\nI\'m going to add a component to this which I feel is necessary because oftentimes when I see a post/comment which highlights Tesla\'s inability to meet goals and/or deadlines, a Tesla fan (or investor) comes forward and questions its significance within the overall market - usually against automotive competitors.\n\nSo, I\'ll compare projections for the Model 3 against the Bolt since those are both in the 200+ mile range EV segment.\n\nI checked various investor materials from both companies\' going back into 2012 and coming forward to 2017. In addition, I checked media reports for general events. Here is when each company made projections of availability for the respective segment entry, when revisions occurred, and the actuality:\n\n***\n\nYear|Tesla|GM\n:--:|:--|:--\n2015 | ["..our goal is to introduce the Model 3, a lower priced sedan designed for the mass market, in 2017."](http://ir.tesla.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1564590-15-1031&amp;CIK=1318605) | [Official debut](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2015/01/naias-2015-chevrolet-bolt-ev-debuts/): "The $30,000 EV crossover concept boasts a range of 200 miles"\n2016 | [Official debut](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/31/11335272/tesla-model-3-announced-price-release-date-specs-preorder): "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the car will deliver at least 215 miles of range beginning at just $35,000"| ["The Bolt EV will be an all-electric vehicle when it goes into production at our Orion Assembly plant in late 2016...](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=231169&amp;p=irol-secTextTest&amp;TEXT=aHR0cDovL2FwaS50ZW5rd2l6YXJkLmNvbS9maWxpbmcueG1sP2lwYWdlPTEwNzA4NjE4JkRTRVE9MCZTRVE9MCZTUURFU0M9U0VDVElPTl9FTlRJUkUmc3Vic2lkPTU3)\n2016 | [(May earnings call transcript, Musk speaking)](https://s.t.st/media/xtranscript/2016/Q2/13559022.pdf): "So as a rough guess, I would say we would aim to produce 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s in the second half of [2017].

I think so. \n\n\n[Here is the google drive with the model paper, and position proof, updated whenever I update them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h2cTeiNRP07K8-2Wn4lYyQtbB_go2HGB?usp=sharing)\n\n\nI'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:\n\n\nCatalysts\n\n\n* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.\n\n* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.\n\n\nRisks:\n\n\n* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.\n\n\n* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.\n\n\n* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.\n\n\nPrice Target:\n\n\n* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. \n\n\nWhat I think:\n\n\nI think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&amp;D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.\n\n\nI have +1 Jan 19 NVDA $350 Call that I purchased for $8.30. Proof in drive. Why not investing more? I don't want a lot of exposure and I'm poor.\n\n\nTLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity.

If it shoves up past it, it might be a pretty nice breakout that could swing for a few days. I personally think its more likely we hit 265 on SPY today and retest the lows of the channel.\n\nEither way, be prepared to see 50 percent of your position vanish LITERALLY before you can sell. GL bros and may God be with you. Be patient with your entry points. Sometimes you'll make more money just waiting and trying to pile onto the trend once it really makes its decision for the day. Even then though, it might turn around instantly. \n\nEdit: I'm looking to short the spy if we get 269ish and will hold a bit past 270 but liquidate at 270.5; taking profits around 265 depending on momentum. If we dont hit it, I probably wont buy puts because they're fucking expensive at the moment. Will buy calls if we get to the 264-265 for a short term bounce but probably will sell half at 266ish and the rest at 267. If we dont hit either of these numbers I'm just watching today.

He might escalate the current trade war, start a real war in North Korea to distract the country from the results of the Mueller investigation, and send SPY puts and the VIX to the moon. [Serious post]This past week has been interesting in the markets. Today and yesterday especially. \n\nWe have a president who is not afraid to set the world on fire, so to speak. He has no qualms about destroying the current world order (which has been so good to commerce and the stock market so far). \n\nTrump\'s first year was marked by restraint, thanks to his advisers.

However, as he has gotten more comfortable with the authority vested to him as President, it appears that Trump\'s darker instincts have taken hold. And as we all know, one of Trump\'s most consistent views is his disdain for international trade and desire for autarky. \n\nWe got a trade war this week. I do not believe that Trump will let down or is actually bluffing. Even if the Chinese offer to negotiate, I doubt Trump actually wants to negotiate. He believes that tariffs will force America to make its own stuff again. That is the true aim of this trade war, it\'s to dissuade firms from importing from abroad and make their own stuff, and employ American workers in the process, to bring about America\'s former manufacturing prowess. \n\nIt is a fundamental ideological view he has held for more than 30 years. We need to sell more to other nations, and attain a high degree of self-sufficiency. That is how countries "win" at trade. \n\nTrade wars are devastating. I believe that Trump will escalate the matter further. He does not believe in negotiating, only brow-beating. May 1st is an important date to watch, as it\'s the date that the exemptions to steel tariffs ends for certain countries like Canada, Mexico, the EU, South Korea, et al. \n\nThe result of a trade war is increased inflation, as consumers pay more to get their stuff. Increased inflation will pressure the Fed to raise rates more quickly than anticipated, and with that goes economic growth and the bull market. Banks are especially under pressure. While increased rates help net interest revenue, if fewer people are borrowing as a result, why would it even matter?\n\nThe second threat to the bull market is political instability from the 2018 mid-terms and the Mueller investigation. Trump feels threatened by these two things. If Democrats take back the House, they can start restraining him a little. Mueller could release a report that puts Trump in a poor light and perhaps recommend him for impeachment. Trump is an authoritarian, and does not believe in accountability from other government institutions. What might he do to draw attention away from these things? He could start a war. \n\nWith hawks like Pompeo and Bolton on board, I believe that Trump will launch some sort of first strike on North Korea to distract everyone from the results of Mueller\'s investigation and undercut Congressional authority in the name of "national security". \n\nThe results of a Second Korean War? Supply chains to Asia will be disrupted, an important trading partner will have its economy flushed down the toilet, and increased government spending to fund such a war will stretch the United States\' financial resources to the limit. \n\nLook at the charts from yesterday and today.

'), ('A little story about following the smart money [Short TSLA DD]', "A little story about following the smart money [Short TSLA DD]So back in the summer of 2007 i was a bright eyed and bushy tailed 18 year old, fresh out of freshman year of college. I didn't have a worry in the world, and neither did anyone else, as every Joe the Plumber could get a jumbo mortgage and buy his dream $700k home in las vegas with an adjustable rate NINJA mortgage. \n\nOne of my college buddies took a family trip to cancun that summer. He was like 5'8, balding but otherwise hairy, with a medium build. He managed to get seduced by a (as described by him) 230lb behemoth who took him back to her place for some good ol unprotected sex a few of the nights.\n\nAnyway - she worked at Goldman. During pillow talk one night, she mentioned that he should stay away from investing in Bear Stearns - they wouldn't be around for much longer. \n\nHe relayed that onto me because he knew i was a budding investing autist. I scoffed at it (but had no money to invest anyway). At that point, Bear was $140 a share and a wall street titan. Even as the first signs of the financial crisis began to pop up, it seemed silly that Bear would be impacted to a greater degree than anyone else - and surely they'd never go bankrupt. \n\nFast forward to the spring of 2008 and bear basically went bankrupt and got sold to JPM for the pity price of $10/share. \n\nSo what's that got to do with anything (other than maybe it's a good idea to fuck a fat chick on vacation to get insider info)?\n\nClearly there's a crisis of confidence regarding TSLA. Shares are down $100 (30%) in less than a month. Bond prices have fallen off a cliff and yields have risen. TSLA is pretty much structurally bankrupt (and always has been) and the stock price was always based on elon's cokedreams, but it seems as though the smart money has had enough of elon's shit. \n\nSoon, M3 depositors will ask for money back, suppliers will ask for better terms (up to potential up-front payment), and cash will dry up. Solar City is a moneyhole that TSLA has to keep funding. TSLA has already securitized and sold off pretty much anything it can (solar city / tesla future revenue streams). TSLA already played the AP game last quarter in order to generate cash flow - can't do that again. They can't really tap the debt market any more with the current bond prices implying that any further raise would happen at 8%+ interest rates. They maybe can still sell a little equity, but that will only further show that the jig is up.\n\nSo follow the smart money that's already been selling stock and bonds and get the fuck out of TSLA (and buy puts). maybe not today - there's some chance elon pulls a rabbit out of his hat regarding Q1 M3 deliveries and there's a bit of a relief rally and shares retrace towards $300. But the M3's being produced right now are shit - all over the internet there are pictures of people being asked to take delivery of cars that wouldn't pass a Kia quality control inspection. There will be endless replacements and warranty claims until TSLA just gives up and rolls over.\n\nI'd expect to see TSLA below $200 within a month, below $100 within 6 months, and perhaps in restructuring talks within a year. \n\nedit - TLDR - fuck fat chicks to get insider info; they'll probably tell you to short TSLA rn"), ('$TSLA Is Going To Miss Production Targets Next Quarter[DD Inside]', '$TSLA Is Going To Miss Production Targets Next Quarter[DD Inside]In case any of you guys missed it: \n\nIn a set of internal memos, the heads of engineering and production at Tesla are trying to ramp up production for Model 3s to exceed 300 cars a day in order to show up the "haters." According to them, this would be a big win and make shorts regret betting against them. It does not confirm if they have even reached 300 models produced per day.\n\nIn reality, this confirms predictions that Tesla will miss promised production targets, again. Tesla promised to increase model production rates to 2500 cars per week.  With some simple math, assuming the factory operates 7 days week producing 300 cars per day, that\'s only 2100 per week. Tesla\'s promises to improve production have allowed them to secure more capital. This does not help their situation, as they are recalling the Model S. If they miss big again, lines or credit and access to capital markets will be limited. \n\n\nSource: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-29/tesla-urges-workers-to-prove-haters-wrong-ramp-up-production\n\nTL;DR: Buy puts on or  short  $TSLA.

I didn't have a worry in the world, and neither did anyone else, as every Joe the Plumber could get a jumbo mortgage and buy his dream $700k home in las vegas with an adjustable rate NINJA mortgage. \n\nOne of my college buddies took a family trip to cancun that summer. He was like 5'8, balding but otherwise hairy, with a medium build. He managed to get seduced by a (as described by him) 230lb behemoth who took him back to her place for some good ol unprotected sex a few of the nights.\n\nAnyway - she worked at Goldman. During pillow talk one night, she mentioned that he should stay away from investing in Bear Stearns - they wouldn't be around for much longer. \n\nHe relayed that onto me because he knew i was a budding investing autist. I scoffed at it (but had no money to invest anyway). At that point, Bear was $140 a share and a wall street titan. Even as the first signs of the financial crisis began to pop up, it seemed silly that Bear would be impacted to a greater degree than anyone else - and surely they'd never go bankrupt. \n\nFast forward to the spring of 2008 and bear basically went bankrupt and got sold to JPM for the pity price of $10/share. \n\nSo what's that got to do with anything (other than maybe it's a good idea to fuck a fat chick on vacation to get insider info)?\n\nClearly there's a crisis of confidence regarding TSLA. Shares are down $100 (30%) in less than a month. Bond prices have fallen off a cliff and yields have risen. TSLA is pretty much structurally bankrupt (and always has been) and the stock price was always based on elon's cokedreams, but it seems as though the smart money has had enough of elon's shit. \n\nSoon, M3 depositors will ask for money back, suppliers will ask for better terms (up to potential up-front payment), and cash will dry up. Solar City is a moneyhole that TSLA has to keep funding. TSLA has already securitized and sold off pretty much anything it can (solar city / tesla future revenue streams). TSLA already played the AP game last quarter in order to generate cash flow - can't do that again. They can't really tap the debt market any more with the current bond prices implying that any further raise would happen at 8%+ interest rates. They maybe can still sell a little equity, but that will only further show that the jig is up.\n\nSo follow the smart money that's already been selling stock and bonds and get the fuck out of TSLA (and buy puts). maybe not today - there's some chance elon pulls a rabbit out of his hat regarding Q1 M3 deliveries and there's a bit of a relief rally and shares retrace towards $300. But the M3's being produced right now are shit - all over the internet there are pictures of people being asked to take delivery of cars that wouldn't pass a Kia quality control inspection. There will be endless replacements and warranty claims until TSLA just gives up and rolls over.\n\nI'd expect to see TSLA below $200 within a month, below $100 within 6 months, and perhaps in restructuring talks within a year. \n\nedit - TLDR - fuck fat chicks to get insider info; they'll probably tell you to short TSLA rn"), ('The next $AAPL, $GOOG, $AMZN, folks!

The ISM manufacturing report for the same month came in at 59.3, compared with a previous monthly reading of 60.8. A reading of 50 or above indicates improving conditions.\n\n&gt;A reading on construction spending, meanwhile, inched up 0.1% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.27 trillion, the Commerce Department reported Monday. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected growth of 0.3%, compared with an unchanged reading in January.\n\n* Trade War\n\n&gt;Trade policy continued to be in the forefront in the minds of investors. China announced tariffs on about 130 U.S. goods, including a 25% penalty slapped on U.S. pork and 15% on fruit. The news means China has made good on its threat to retaliate against the Trump administration’s tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports. \n\n&gt;“Today’s weakness has everything to do with China’s announced tariffs. Even though they were quite small, there’s a fear that this could escalate. We don’t know if this could be the end as far as retaliation goes, but it seems like the trade issue is escalating into bite and not just bark,” said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co.\n\n\n* Tech Woes\n\n&gt;Technology and internet stocks have also remained in focus, as the sector—still one of the stronger performing of the year—has undergone heavy volatility.\n\n&gt;Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co. also pointed to the weakness in tech and internet stocks as a main focus for investors. “You need to keep in mind that these stocks have had tremendous upward moves over the past year, but whenever the specter of Washington shines on an industry, you typically don’t get good performance. That’s what we’re seeing right now.”\n\n* Apple isn\'t Tech\n\nFinViz classifies it as consumer goods, not technology. It swings with the tech stocks still.\n\nWH is shining light on big data and tech.

Since most of you are casuals and probably on Robhinhood, I thought it would be fun to write up a thread on some plays I’ve been thinking about for the month of April. I’m also drinking alone at home, so why not. These plays are risky. If you lose, you **will** lose over half (or all) of your initial “investment”. If you win, you could make a lot more. \n\nAll prices I use will be the middle point between today’s closing bid-ask spread. Come Monday morning, these prices and values may be wildly different, but the theory behind my reasoning will be the same (assuming underlying share price stays around the same). I also may or may not already have positions open for some of these plays. I promise you I’m not trying to pump options prices or sell you overpriced calls. None of these plays will be on penny stocks or low volume companies, so I can’t move their share price. If I had that kind of clout, I wouldn’t be typing up stuff on this retarded subreddit. \n\nThese plays will also be simple. No spreads or exotic options plays. I might save that for another thread if this takes off. \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Wells Fargo ($WFC)**\n-\n\nThe play that comes right after this one is objectively better in almost every way, but I’m putting this play first because it’ll give you some insight into my theories. \n\nWells Fargo and other banks (bar JPM) have been struggling really hard this year. Wells Fargo has been struggling the most. I consider this pick to be a badly cut diamond in a pile of other, slightly worse, badly cut diamonds. But here’s the thing with badly cut diamonds like WFC: they have really cheap premiums. Their options premiums are low because investors expect these companies to do poorly (because of recent performance), have low volatility (because of their generally stable nature), and/or are simply overlooked. \n\nWFC has not been stable this year. It’s down over 20% from its highest point this year ($66/share), which is a lot for a largely stable company, let alone a large financial company like WFC. Despite its downward trend, WFC has not fallen below $52 very often. Even during today’s huge red day, and other red days alike, WFC has a hard time staying below $52. This makes me believe that it has reached its bottom and that investor sentiment cannot realistically drop lower until we have more material information. \n\nWFC’s earnings report is on April 13th. When I see companies like these, where share price has tanked but then refuses to tank any further on horribly red days, I see a potential buying opportunity. Call prices are usually low, implied volatility is low, and investor sentiment is rock bottom. That means that even average news can increase share price. Above average news can send it flying. This news is coming up very soon and is a gambling opportunity in my book. Note that this is a *gamble*. You will most likely lose 100%, so put in only what you’re comfortable losing. \n\n* **April 13th 52.50 Calls**\n\nThese calls are stupidly cheap for an earnings play on a recently volatile company. An increase of 2.3% in the underlying makes this call profitable. WFC *today* dropped almost 2%. Personally, I think investors have overlooked this company, and its options, far too much. I think that average news will increase WFC’s share price to $54/share, which is an around 3% increase from today’s closing price. Anything more is great, but I’m banking on average and hoping for more. I’m also hoping for an increase in share price next week before earnings. The play here is to buy April 13th 52.50 calls. \n\nIf share price goes up to $54, these calls will **profit 56%** (again, using prices derived from today’s closing bid-ask spread). If share price goes up to $55, these calls will **profit 160%**. If share price goes up to $65, near its highest price from this year, these calls will **profit 1200%** (unlikey to happen). \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Financials ETF ($XLF)**\n-\n\nI was debating on whether to share this pick in this thread or not because I haven’t bought calls yet myself. But then I thought, who in the hell with enough money to pump up prices on an ETF this large would also listen to my advice? Anyway, this play is a variation of the play I shared above with WFC, but better (less upside, though with much greater chance for success). This ETF is impregnated by Warren Buffett, and other financial companies and banks.\n\nThe premium on these calls is ridiculously low. They’re low because 1. this is an ETF filled with very stable companies, so it’s doubly stable; and 2. sentiment among financials this year has been lackluster. But with earnings seasons kicking off on April 13th with banks, I expect this ETF to be extra volatile. It’s not priced for volatility because investors don’t think this earnings seasons will start off with a bang, but I think it will because I’m smarter than those fucks. \n\n* **September 21st 30.00 calls**\n\nThis play isn’t all-or-nothing. In fact, even if the play goes south, there will still be plenty of premium left in it for some semblance of recovery. But the point isn’t to baghold. What you should be doing is selling these calls come April 13th no matter what happens — unless you believe trade war fears will die down and the entire market will recover. This play *does* leave that avenue open to you. Still, don’t do it. Just get rid of it and move on. \n\nIf the underlying goes to $28/share (~3% increase), these calls will **profit ~50%**. If the underlying goes to $29/share (~6.7% increase), these calls will **profit ~140%**. If the underying goes to where it was before trade war fears came up ($30/share), these calls will **profit ~220%**. \n\nThe above values are rough estimates of what you could realistically see. They’re conservative estimates and on the lower end, so you don’t feel like I jipped you if share price goes up and calls aren’t as profitable as I advertised. \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Amazon ($AMZN)**\n-\n\n* **April 13th 1500 calls**\n\nThe timing for this play has most likely already passed if Monday opens green. It’s also incredibly risky. It depends on a single green day early in the week, and if that green day doesn’t come, it’s over. I only put $2000 into these calls today at closing because the likelihood of this succeeding is basically nothing. \n\nWe all know Trump hates Amazon. Share price dropped from almost $1600 to $1400 with Trump’s tweets coupled with trade war fears. However, $50 swings in this company’s share price is not uncommon. In fact, this thing had a $100 swing just this week, in less than 2 full trading days, before today’s tariff announcement. \n\nAll I need is for share price to go back up to $1450 before Wednesday mid-day. If it does, these calls will **profit ~300%**. If share price goes up to $1475, these calls will **profit ~600%**. If there’s another $100 swing up to $1500, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. \n\nThe above estimates are, again, a bit on the low end. Timing also matters a lot here. A 300% profit one day may only be 100% the next (with the same change in underlying). \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Micron Technology ($MU)**\n-\n\n* **April 20th 50.00 calls**\n\nDon’t buy this shit. \n'), ('[Serious] Ultimate Guide to Bagholding Equities and ETFs', '[Serious] Ultimate Guide to Bagholding Equities and ETFsSuppose you bought right at the top and your position has moved against you. Now what do you do? Here is a list of things you can do.\n\n\n1. Nothing. Yup that is the first thing you could do. You could just wait and hope that the stock goes back up.\n\n2. Panic Sell. All you do is hit the sell button and realize your loses. Great if you need a tax break.\n\n3. Tax loss harvest. Similar to number 2, works great for ETFs, kinda hard to do for equities. So suppose you bought the S&amp;P 500 right at the top and it drops. All you do sell the ETF for a loss and buy something similar. For example, you could sub out SPY for QQQ (another example is swapping MU for AMAT) and once 30 days has passed, you can go back to opening SPY and successfully harvest losses. Note that the ETF that you swap it out for must not be "substantially identical," aka you can\'t sub SPY for VOO (since both of them track the S&amp;P 500).\n\n4. Double down/average down. As the name implies, as the price goes down, you buy more. You should only do this if you are still bullish.\n\n5. Selling covered calls + Double down. (If you are bearish in the short term but bullish in the long term)\n\nNote this requires a Level 1 Options. If you can\'t get approved for a level 1 options account, then you are a true faggot. Here is how to this strategy. Buy more shares so that your total amount of shares is a multiple of 100. For example if you have 48 shares of NVDA, then you go out and buy 52 more shares. Next you go out and sell some OTM covered calls. Selling calls with a week or two works best for this in order to maximize Theta decay.\n\n6. Selling naked calls. Note you have to have naked calls from your broker and you also need a margin account. Basically is the same thing as above except instead of buying 52 more shares of NVDA, you just selling a call. Don\'t get too greedy with this. If the share shoots up, you will get cucked.\n\n7. Buy a put. Pretty self explanatory.\n\n8. Collars. Can be combined with 6 in order to cap losses. For every 100 shares you own, you sell an OTM call and buy an OTM put. Works great if you want to protect yourself from an unexpected to drop in price but also don\'t want to pay for an OTM put. Recommended expiration date (1-2 years).\n\n9. Stock repair strategy. (Requires options and a margin account). Suppose you don\'t want to commit any more money to a trade and all you want to do at this point is just break even. Here is what you can do, buy a ATM call and sell two OTM calls. The price of the ATM or close to ATM call should be equal to the price of the two OTM calls or as close to equal. This way you don\'t have to commit any more capital to the trade. Recommended expiration date is 1-2 months out.\n\nHere is a example.\n\nSuppose you bought Facebook right before the Cambridge Analytica thing. Let\'s say you bought 1000 shares @ 172.5. Now it is March 23, and well you are down around $13k. What you can do this buy 10 $162.5 calls (May 4th) for $1.20 and sell 20 172.5 calls @ $0.6 (Try to get your debit/credit under 5 cents, just put an offer and eventually it will get filled).\n Now there are three cases.\n1. Facebook tanks even more. In this case you collect that 0.05 Premium per share (since we have a credit). Please note that you shouldn\'t try to maximize credit for this strategy.\n\n2. Facebook recovers a little bit to $160, you net even on expiration date since your call that you bought will expire worthless and the two calls you sold will expire worthless. Watch your trades however since sometimes if it recovers a little bit, you can close you your trade for a profit. \n\n3. Facebook expires between $162.50 and $172.50, this is the best result as your $162.50 will expire profitable and the two $172.50 calls will expire worthless.\n\n4. Facebook gaps up past $172.50, you will still end up profitable at the end since you own the underlying, however in this situation you would have made more money not using this strategy. \n\n\nPlease do a quick Google search before attempting any of the strategies that involve options if you don\'t know what you are doing.\n\n\nFAQ\nQ: Can I do the stock repair strategy for options? \n\nA: No, you can\'t buy an option for an option unless if you have an ISDA. If you don\'t know what an ISDA is, fuck off and go watch The Big Short. Even if you do have an ISDA, calls-on-calls are very illiquid assets.\n\nIf there was anything unclear or you have questions, please ask below.'), ('How AMD is the top stock to buy before 4/20', 'How AMD is the top stock to buy before 4/20Hello WSB, last night while i was drunk off my ass i had a dream.

But here’s the thing with badly cut diamonds like WFC: they have really cheap premiums. Their options premiums are low because investors expect these companies to do poorly (because of recent performance), have low volatility (because of their generally stable nature), and/or are simply overlooked. \n\nWFC has not been stable this year. It’s down over 20% from its highest point this year ($66/share), which is a lot for a largely stable company, let alone a large financial company like WFC. Despite its downward trend, WFC has not fallen below $52 very often. Even during today’s huge red day, and other red days alike, WFC has a hard time staying below $52. This makes me believe that it has reached its bottom and that investor sentiment cannot realistically drop lower until we have more material information. \n\nWFC’s earnings report is on April 13th. When I see companies like these, where share price has tanked but then refuses to tank any further on horribly red days, I see a potential buying opportunity. Call prices are usually low, implied volatility is low, and investor sentiment is rock bottom. That means that even average news can increase share price. Above average news can send it flying. This news is coming up very soon and is a gambling opportunity in my book. Note that this is a *gamble*. You will most likely lose 100%, so put in only what you’re comfortable losing. \n\n* **April 13th 52.50 Calls**\n\nThese calls are stupidly cheap for an earnings play on a recently volatile company. An increase of 2.3% in the underlying makes this call profitable. WFC *today* dropped almost 2%. Personally, I think investors have overlooked this company, and its options, far too much. I think that average news will increase WFC’s share price to $54/share, which is an around 3% increase from today’s closing price. Anything more is great, but I’m banking on average and hoping for more. I’m also hoping for an increase in share price next week before earnings. The play here is to buy April 13th 52.50 calls. \n\nIf share price goes up to $54, these calls will **profit 56%** (again, using prices derived from today’s closing bid-ask spread). If share price goes up to $55, these calls will **profit 160%**. If share price goes up to $65, near its highest price from this year, these calls will **profit 1200%** (unlikey to happen). \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Financials ETF ($XLF)**\n-\n\nI was debating on whether to share this pick in this thread or not because I haven’t bought calls yet myself. But then I thought, who in the hell with enough money to pump up prices on an ETF this large would also listen to my advice? Anyway, this play is a variation of the play I shared above with WFC, but better (less upside, though with much greater chance for success). This ETF is impregnated by Warren Buffett, and other financial companies and banks.\n\nThe premium on these calls is ridiculously low. They’re low because 1. this is an ETF filled with very stable companies, so it’s doubly stable; and 2. sentiment among financials this year has been lackluster. But with earnings seasons kicking off on April 13th with banks, I expect this ETF to be extra volatile. It’s not priced for volatility because investors don’t think this earnings seasons will start off with a bang, but I think it will because I’m smarter than those fucks. \n\n* **September 21st 30.00 calls**\n\nThis play isn’t all-or-nothing. In fact, even if the play goes south, there will still be plenty of premium left in it for some semblance of recovery. But the point isn’t to baghold. What you should be doing is selling these calls come April 13th no matter what happens — unless you believe trade war fears will die down and the entire market will recover. This play *does* leave that avenue open to you. Still, don’t do it. Just get rid of it and move on. \n\nIf the underlying goes to $28/share (~3% increase), these calls will **profit ~50%**. If the underlying goes to $29/share (~6.7% increase), these calls will **profit ~140%**. If the underying goes to where it was before trade war fears came up ($30/share), these calls will **profit ~220%**. \n\nThe above values are rough estimates of what you could realistically see. They’re conservative estimates and on the lower end, so you don’t feel like I jipped you if share price goes up and calls aren’t as profitable as I advertised. \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Amazon ($AMZN)**\n-\n\n* **April 13th 1500 calls**\n\nThe timing for this play has most likely already passed if Monday opens green. It’s also incredibly risky. It depends on a single green day early in the week, and if that green day doesn’t come, it’s over. I only put $2000 into these calls today at closing because the likelihood of this succeeding is basically nothing. \n\nWe all know Trump hates Amazon. Share price dropped from almost $1600 to $1400 with Trump’s tweets coupled with trade war fears. However, $50 swings in this company’s share price is not uncommon. In fact, this thing had a $100 swing just this week, in less than 2 full trading days, before today’s tariff announcement. \n\nAll I need is for share price to go back up to $1450 before Wednesday mid-day. If it does, these calls will **profit ~300%**. If share price goes up to $1475, these calls will **profit ~600%**. If there’s another $100 swing up to $1500, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. \n\nThe above estimates are, again, a bit on the low end. Timing also matters a lot here. A 300% profit one day may only be 100% the next (with the same change in underlying). \n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Micron Technology ($MU)**\n-\n\n* **April 20th 50.00 calls**\n\nDon’t buy this shit. \n'), ('Recap: Day 5 of US Economic Results', 'Recap: Day 5 of US Economic Results[Recap: Day 4 of US Economic Results Forecasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8a4ptf/recap_day_4_of_us_economic_results_forecasts/)\n\n[Recap: Day 3 of US Economic Results Forecasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/89yeu7/recap_day_3_of_us_economic_results_forecasts_2nd/)\n\n[Recap: Day 2 of US Economic Results Forecasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/89lgtc/recap_day_2_of_us_economic_results_forecasts/)\n\n[Recap: Day 1 of US Economic Results Forecasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/895ygq/recap_day_1_of_us_economic_results_forecasts/)\n\n[Ref. original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/88injx/us_economic_results_4218_4618/)\n\nLet\'s go over the results for today:\n\n**FORECAST**\n\n**Non-farm payrolls**\n\nForecast: 198.0\n\nPredicted (i.e. what I predicted): 178.6\n\nActual: 103.0\n\nPredicted a miss.

These will not go away. China is only the first country to counter our tariffs. Wait until other countries realize they can exact massive pain on us by levying their own. You guys know Mexico, right? Well, they just told Trump to quit being a dick or they\'ll stop collaborating. In other words, they\'re telling us to stop fucking with them or they\'re going to fuck with us right back. Trump doesn\'t want a wall to keep people out. He wants one to make sure he still has a cheap labor supply for his fucking golf courses.\n\n* We just got our first hint of the subprime auto loan bubble collapsing. Several smaller lenders have entered bankruptcy proceedings in the last month. What changed in the last month? I can\'t boil it down to a simple answer, but the short of it is: turns out that, on average, people still can\'t afford to buy things, and the default rate is starting to weigh down the industry. And if you think they\'ve hedged appropriately, you\'re the type of idiot who\'d get a subprime loan in the first place.\n\n"I\'m concerned that we may not be able to attribute dips to overreactions anymore," is a complete fucking understatement. **STAY AWAY FROM WEEKLIES** and start shifting a portion of your portfolio to cash if more shit-meets-fan cues manifest.

Buy in by COB Wednesday to take advantage, and exploit using $XLF options or $FAS.\n\nThesis: The financial sector is one of the most undervalued in the market right now, and as earnings season begins I expect the market to finally give the sector the attention it deserves. Reasons:\n\n1. The financial sector is tremendously undervalued right now when you [simply look at ratios](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true). At 18.3, the financial sector currently has a P/E ratio that is not only the lowest in the S&amp;P 500, but [is in line with historical P/E ratios](http://www.multpl.com/), unlike many sectors right now. \n2. Earnings should be strong for a couple reasons. One of these reasons is that net interest margins, the difference between the interest a bank pays and the interest it receives, [has been expanding](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo-and-pnc-financial-are-part-of-zacks-earnings-preview-cm945379), possibly more than analysts have been expecting.\n3. Another reason to expect strong earnings is strong economic fundamentals. The market has had ADHD recently with concerns about tariffs, $FB data usage, Trump tweets about $AMZN, and so on. Investors have lost sight of the fact that the economy is pretty strong right now, but earnings season will remind them of that. We have great job numbers, rising household incomes, high consumer confidence, and so on. These are conditions that lead to high use of the financial sector among both consumers and industry.\n4. Another reason for strong earnings is this is the first quarter of earnings after tax reform. Enough said.\n5. FAANG may finally be becoming passe. I realize as I am typing this that $NFLX is up 3.5% today (though on low volume) even though it has a P/E ratio around 232, but the market seems a bit more skittish around tech ever since the Cambridge Analytica news came out. Retail investors are being dumb and buying the bubble, but [big investors are very short on tech right now](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/04/09/hedge-funds-turn-bearish-on-tech-giants/). (If you don't have access for WSJ stop being a pleb.

This week kicks off earnings season. On Thursday, [$OZRK and $CBSH announce premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-12). On Friday, [$C, $FHN, $FRC, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC are all announcing premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-13). All of these are forecast to have improved YOY EPS, and some of them significantly so. P/E ratios for these are respectively: 14.14, 20.62, none, 27.41, 21.09, 17.86, 14.57, and 13.06.\nMore importantly, one year forward P/E ratios for these are respectively: 12.65, 17.49, 10.72, 13.08, 18.87, 12.27, 14.04, and 11.14. These valuations are as close as you can get to a steal in this market.\n\n\n\nHow to exploit:\n\n1. Trade $XLF. It's a high volume ETF that tracks the financial sector of the S&amp;P 500. Of the banks announcing earnings this week, its holdings include $C, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC. I would expect good results among these banks to raise share prices among the rest of the holdings of $XLF. Simply buying $XLF is the safe play.\n2. Buy calls in $XLF. Pretty straightforward.\n3. Buy $FAS.This is a 3x leveraged ETF tracking the financial sector. It tracks all of the banks announcing earnings this week, among others. It has average volume of around 2.3 million shares per day at a price of around $65, so it's big enough that liquidity won't be an issue. This is what I'm doing.\n4. Buy calls in $FAS. This is only for those who play Russian roulette for fun. DON'T DO THIS.\n\nFor any of these methods, I would buy in the next couple days. With today's gains, I feel like there are decent odds of a pullback. Look for buying opportunities.

This package will grant him over 500 million dollars for market caps reached at 100 Billion and at 50 billion increments above that, vesting 1% of the shares outstanding per increment up to 12% of shares outstanding. It is reliant on market based milestones, which musk can influence with his public brand and on acquisitions to further integrate the company as a renewable energy company. The exercise price is that of TSLA shares on Jan 18 2018, around $350. Additionally the vesting is reliant on operational milestones involving increased revenues and EBIDTA. The operational requirements may be achieved through aggressive accounting practices and wouldn't be hurt by strange depreciation accounting that would improve FCF. In the current compensation plan, Musk is required to have TSLA achieve 30% or more in gross margins for several consecutive quarters. We have instances of capitalisation of expenses that has helped get TSLA’s margins close to that number in previous years. If Musk believes or sees that these milestones are unreachable, even with the zeal that he can inspire in his followers, he may very well jump ship. When you realise that they don't expense R&amp;D as cost of goods sold then you realise what is being done to inflate the gross margin figures.\n\n**Exhibit 2**\n\nSolarCity acquisition should have been illegal from a corporate governance point of view. Six of Tesla’s seven directors have clear ties to SolarCity. Tesla’s board includes SolarCity’s former CFO, a SolarCity director, and two VCs whose firms also have seats on SolarCity’s board, along with Musk’s brother, Kimbal. Musk chairs both companies and is SolarCity’s largest shareholder. He has taken out $475 million in personal credit lines to buy more shares in SolarCity and Tesla when advantageous. SpaceX, his aerospace company, has purchased $165 million in bonds issued by SolarCity. Some analysts cautioned that Musk might be self-dealing, rescuing his own investments and his cousins’ company through this purchase. Hedge-fund manager Jim Chanos, who had shorted Tesla and SolarCity, called the acquisition a “shameful example of corporate governance at its worst,” a “bailout” of SolarCity that “strikes us as just the height of folly.” SolarCity was not doing well, Chanos believed that it was on its way to bankruptcy, with its bonds yielding over 20% by the time that they were bought.\n\n**Exhibit 3**\n\nMusk’s public popularity raises valuations of the companies who he attaches himself to. He has been touted as the world’s Tony Stark. Just go to YouTube to watch the drivel that fanboys post about him. Recently and notably, Youtuber boyinaband has begun to celebrate Musk with his audience and the amount of absurd “thug life” and “MUSK DESTROYS” compilations on youtube is beginning to rival that of Jordan Peterson.\n\n**Exhibit 4**\n\nAlong with these liquid stock grants that further dilute shareholders, TSLA equity finances a lot, especially, it seems, when they assure shareholders that they have no plans to. They also issue a lot of debt, and are not transparent with their plans to raise capital. When asked about TSLA capital needs in last year’s Q2, Musk responded, “And now that said, there may be some wisdom in having a cash cushion for unexpected events. You just never know if there's going be some significant force majeure events in the world. It could be an earthquake in California, for example. But we're not at this point considering an equity raise. We are thinking about debt, but we're not thinking about an equity raise.” Considering that the Company announced the debt raise less than a week later and is already on a roadshow, management was clearly well past the “thinking about” stage at the time of Q2 earnings. In fact, the Company seems already well on its way to a raise in contacting debt rating agencies and planning for a roadshow. Readers can determine whether Tesla’s representation during earnings call was accurate. There are many other instances of this kind of behaviour by TSLA management, and is not a credit to their credibility. Their only positive cash flows come from financing activities and they now have a D/E of 2.22. It is clear from a quick look at their cash flow statements that even in 2017 they are raising far more debt than they are paying back. Also they keep claiming in their 10-K that they are innovative manufacturers, and are supremely safe, meanwhile they have to borrow Panasonic employees and are hand-assembling batteries, and they change their production forecasts downwards many times a season.\n\n\n\n**Exhibit 5**\n\nThey are becoming increasingly unprofitable as their revenues scale. This is highly unusual as one would expect that fixed costs would begin to be spread as they scale. This points to a break even point at lower rather than higher than current sales volumes given the current infrastructure. This of course would run completely contrary to their plans of becoming an all round provider of sustainable energy vehicles and other products. Their interest expenses have also more than doubled moving into 2017, with precipitous increases in SG&amp;A expenses. These lower incomes are not as a result of higher R&amp;D costs, as those have risen less than proportionally. Their EPS fell by 200% from 2016 to 2017.\n\n**Exhibit 6**\n\nOther than Elon Musk, CFO Deepak Ahuja and CTO J.B. Straubel no other executives are listed on its website, its investor relations page or in the annual report filings. Over the last year over 30 Executives and directors have left the company including chiefs in accounting and the CFO and the head of the Autopilot engineering division. This is an especially bad sign and is the hallmark of a failing company.\n\n**Exhibit 7**\n\nTSLA are no longer leaders in the most vigorous part of automobiles, which is autonomous vehicles. Among the largest market cap automobile manufacturers, TSLA has relatively unsophisticated autonomy in cars so far, trailing even behind GM. Considering that they were touted as pioneers in this field, with their first forays with NVDA, this does not bode well. Also given the lack of scrutiny that investors place on Musk, most likely the stock price still has expectations of leadership in autonomous vehicles baked into the price.\n\n**Exhibit 8**\n\nMany other incumbents are catching up to TSLA in high end EVs, and already has a presence in economy EVs segment. The market is very competitive and there is no reason to expect that TSLA will become leaders. Also TSLA has huge reliability issues according to TrueDelta.com, ranking as the most unreliable car purchasable in America.\n\n**Exhibit 9**\n\nTesla may not be eligible for the subsidies granted by the government, given that the Model S pollutes more than a Jeep on a per mile basis in the US, when accounting for the pollution in production and recharging.\n\n**Exhibit 10**\n\nTax credits in the US will no longer benefit TSLA in its Solar Energy provisions post December 2021. The services that they provide will no longer be tax exempt for residences. Expenditures only include set up costs, set up services are also provided by TSLA. By 2025, economic benefits for electric cars will also disappear in Norway if gas cars become banned. People will then flock to other auto manufacturers producing electric cars as the demand for TSLA exceeds supply.\n\n* Quoted from the 10-K risk section:\n\n&gt;We currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles. In the U.S. and abroad, such incentives include, among other things, tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees, the 25% value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. Notably, the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gas-powered vehicles through the oil and gas industries. Nevertheless, even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted. For example, in April 2017 and January 2016, respectively, previously available incentives in Hong Kong and Denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired, negatively impacting sales. Moreover, under current regulations, a $7,500 federal tax credit available in the U.S. for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles with at least 17 kWh of battery capacity, such as our vehicles, will begin to phase out over time with respect to any vehicles delivered in the second calendar quarter following the quarter in which we deliver our 200,000th qualifying vehicle in the U.S. We currently expect such 200,000th qualifying delivery to occur at some point during 2018. In addition, California implemented regulations phasing out a $2,500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for high-income consumers, which became effective in March 2016. In certain circumstances, there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interests to bring about such developments, which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles.\n\nThis will all further fuck their shitty cash flows.\n\n**Exhibit 11**\n\nReservation deposits are another way to finance the company.\n\n**Exhibit 12**\n\nVerbiage is relatively extravagant, overstating or emphasising features of their products that are not differentiating and are completely expected given their sector. For example their use of inverters, that they write their own software, make their own UI, the autopilot feature which is reportedly not better than many competitors and the fact that their power storage is infinitely scalable. Also they claim that they have core competencies in powertrain engineering, vehicle engineering, innovative manufacturing and energy storage, then they disclose in the risk section that they HAVE NO EXPERIENCE TO DATE IN MANUFACTURING VEHICLES IN HIGH VOLUMES. Clearly they are not competent in their core competencies. In producing the Model 3, they were so incapable of meeting demand that some of the production line is by hand, there were constant bottlenecks, quality control employees were totally inexperienced is automobiles. Batteries could be defective and management apparently didn’t care. Apparently their stress tests aren’t efficient either.\n\n**Exhibit 13**\n\nSolar City’s lease agreement model is highly risky for homeowners to agree to, it puts their house to a commitment to pay rising prices for a technology whose efficiency and cost is decreasing in the long term. It’s like buying a 20 year bond when you know rates are going up, it’s totally retarded and becomes a huge liability on the house when you need to sell it, because only a braindead idiot would want to buy a house on which they are forced to pay a coupon out to Solar City on a less than optimal solar rig. It’s like a subprime lending company. And Solar City won’t be able to compete against highly subsidised and technologically advanced solar manufacturers like DQ in China in the regular solar panel sales market. They have no claim on the residential market. Also it’s worth mentioning that Elon’s cousins run the company, and Elon is majority shareholder. So he basically bailed his family out of this shitty company when he bought it. It’s as cancerous as Goldman Sachs.\n\n**Exhibit 14**\n\nOut of warranty, Teslas become extremely expensive, especially since the way they’re built and service policies require less modular servicing. The battery costs 12000 dollars to replace for the Model S, and 40000 dollars for the Roadster, door handles cost 1000 dollars to replace each, and apparently they’re highly unreliable, 5000 dollars to replace the touchscreen which can become discoloured or even misaligned leading to freezing. Drive unit replacement would cost 6000 dollars out of pocket, which is composed of the entire so called power train, this is the source of the lack of modularity in repairs. Also TSLA does not support the used car market very well, apparently parts for salvage vehicles are impossible to acquire for “safety reasons”, even though competitor electric car makers do provide salvage parts, and it is not possible to see the service history of a used car.\n\n**Exhibit 15**\n\nTesla has a penchant for forecasting very unrealistic production numbers. Their forecasts for weekly production at the beginning of the year were 5000 units of the Model 3 per week by Q2. They said they’d have this production rate by mid 2017 before, and now they're making about 700 units a week, when they said they'd pull off 2500 by the end of Q1. Also TSLA has started issuing VIN insequencially, so it is more difficult to track production rates and service rates of newer vehicles.\n\n**Exhibit 16**\n\nWhile most investors are aware Tesla had received 518,000 Model 3 reservations as-of early August, 63,000 of which had been cancelled (12.16%), few know the problems Tesla has faced trying to get their own employees to convert Model 3 deposits to reservations. Tesla and SpaceX employees placed an estimated 13,000 Model 3 reservations and Tesla was counting on this army of employee beta testers, bound by NDAs and the threat of being fired (or worse, losing their stock option grants) to beta-test the Model 3 without leaking details to the public. Quite surprisingly, on November 15th Tesla sent out the first batch of Model 3 configuration invitations to non-employees (Electrek reported non-employee configurations on November 21st) with the first known non-employee VIN assigned November 22nd and the earliest confirmed non-employee delivery on December 20th. Based on Tesla’s fourth quarter production and delivery press release, a total of 1,892 Model 3s had been produced prior to December 21st - indicating the estimated 13,000 employee Model 3 reservations translated into perhaps 1,500 firm orders (11.5%).\n\n**Exhibit 17**\n\nThe price is just too high on the Model 3, which is supposed to be their mass market product. Tesla is only shipping the ‘Long Range’ Model 3 loaded with mandatory options: Not only are there very few $51,000+ compact sedans in the world (for good reason), reservations holders initially believed they were purchasing a $35,000 vehicle ($25,000 net of Federal and State tax credits) with $5,000 to $10,000 of potential options. The shift in pricing likely explains our estimated 11.5% conversion rate on Tesla’s 13,000 employee Model 3 reservations - these are primarily hourly workers, after all! Apparently sales in the Model 3 price range is just 1/6th of the sales in the 20k-30k. So much for mass market.\n\n**Exhibit 18**\n\nOn the gross margin front, due to Tesla’s ‘unique’ accounting, we forecast gross margins of 15% to 20% for the Model 3 at average sales prices $46,500 per copy - but this will merely be an accounting mirage: If we apply traditional automaker accounting to our Model 3 forecasts - reducing the sales price by 10% to re-allocate SG&amp;A (19.41% at Tesla versus 7% for Ford and GM) as well as include expensed R&amp;D in COGS, the $46,500 Model 3 would generate gross margins of –7.48%. The irony is that Tesla’s bull case (a mainstream car) is finally here, quite possibly bringing about their downfall (via massively flawed business model). The way this happens is by reducing the gross margin by the 10% discount that regular automakers give to dealerships, that save them SG&amp;A expenses, TSLA’s gross margins look nothing special. But when you realise that TSLA expenses R&amp;D costs that should be in in COGS in a separate line, since it’s development on current vehicles, the gross margins are actually much worse than the other companies.\n\n* Cost of Revenue - TSLA\nAutomotive\nCost of automotive revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead (including amortized tooling costs), shipping and logistic costs, vehicle internet connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive revenue also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write-down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for on-hand inventory that is either obsolete or in excess of forecasted demand. -- (NOTICE NO EXPENSED R&amp;D)\n\n\n* GM - Research and Development Expenditures \nResearch and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive cost of sales, were $7.3 billion, $6.6 billion and $6.0 billion in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

I am going to introduce a new game to you all so that you can literally gamble on the stock market as if it were a roulette table at your local casino.\n\nThe game is called **Autist’s Roulette** and it is played by guessing the point range that SPY will be in at the end of the week.\n\nUsing an option strategy call an **iron condor**  you can actually make this bet with real money, and the payoffs can be surprisingly huge.\n\nYou might say, “But hold up Shady, what the fuck is an iron condor?” I will briefly explain it for you fuckbois who are too lazy or too stupid to go on investopedia. An iron condor is an option strategy that makes money when the underlying falls within a certain range. You do this by selling a call and selling a put, the range in between which is where you will make the most money. You then use that premium to buy a call and buy a put that are just outside of the ones you wrote in order to limit the maximum loss. The inner legs (the options you write) are the body of the bird, and the outter legs (the options you buy) are the wings. Hence iron condor. Simple enough right? Probably not for most of you.\n\nNow the gains from an iron condor are pretty modest, but, if you make the inner legs closer together, and keep the outer legs within one point, then you can get a return of up to 2, 3, 5, or more times your maximum risk in one week\n\nNow let me explain how it works using a fictional casino.\n\nIt’s monday at 9:30am and you walk into the casino to find a new game, **Autists’ Roulette**. There is a big roulette wheel with all the possible prices for SPY this week listed on it. Say SPY is currently at 266.50 right now. Numbers closer to the current number that SPY is at have a larger slice of the wheel. The further away the numbers are then the smaller the slice gets, hence these ones being less likely to land on. If you win, your bet turns into $100, if you lose then the casino takes your bet. The thing is that bets with larger slices of the wheel will have a higher buy-in, so you will make less money. You want to bet that SPY is gunna close in its 266-267 range on friday.  The dealer says the bet will cost you $41 (he is gunna use this money to sell a 266P and a 267C then buy a 265P and a 268C for a net credit of $59). He spins the wheel, and it doesn’t stop until friday at 4pm. Turns out you were right, and the wheel lands on 266.73. The dealer takes your $41 and hands you a crispy $100  bill. Congratulations, you have more than doubled your money in just a week.\n\nIn short, **Autists’ Roulette** is a game where you try and pick the correct one point spread that SPY will close in on friday. I figured if you guys were sick of losing money on FD’s then you could give this strategy a try in order to triple or double your gainz in only a week.\n\nLet me know what you think. Am I retarded?

With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.', 'How to play extremely high-risk FDs with 1000% upside. With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I\'ve been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.\n\nSince you all love throwing your money away, I\'ll share how I play FDs. I cannot understate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won\'t go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you\'re serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.\n\nI only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I\'ll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It\'s possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I\'ll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don\'t go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. \n\nIn my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn\'t a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you\'re only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don\'t mess with FDs if I\'m only looking at a realistic upside of 500%. \n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**\n-\n\nI haven\'t bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I\'ve bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. \n\nSo, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn\'t like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ\'s results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn\'t have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.\n\nThus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.\n\n-\n\n**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you\'ll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. \n\n1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. \n\n2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We\'re banking on some unexpected volatility. \n\n3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it\'s all over. \n\n4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. \n\n5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ\'s average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I\'m predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that\'s more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it\'s a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ\'s yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday\'s close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.\n\n6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren\'t really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.\n\n-\n\nAnd now onto the actual play.\n\n* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**\n\nThese are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday\'s closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. \n\nIf this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say "Wednesday noon", I don\'t actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. \n\nThese estimates are going to be off because we\'re dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you\'re trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I\'m not wrong often.\n\nBy the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you\'re down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.\n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Apple ($AAPL)**\n-\n\nI personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I\'ll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. \n\n* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**\n\nThese calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. \n\nReasoning in decreasing significance: \n\n1. Apple\'s earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. \n\n2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn\'t only because they\'re both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. \n\n3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. \n\n4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn\'t a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don\'t go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. \n\n5. With the tax cuts and Apple\'s big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they\'re good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.\n\n-\n\nAs always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there\'s a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn\'t go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road.

I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.\n\nSince you all love throwing your money away, I\'ll share how I play FDs. I cannot understate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won\'t go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you\'re serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.\n\nI only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I\'ll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It\'s possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I\'ll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don\'t go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. \n\nIn my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn\'t a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you\'re only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don\'t mess with FDs if I\'m only looking at a realistic upside of 500%. \n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**\n-\n\nI haven\'t bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I\'ve bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. \n\nSo, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn\'t like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ\'s results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn\'t have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.\n\nThus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.\n\n-\n\n**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you\'ll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. \n\n1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. \n\n2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We\'re banking on some unexpected volatility. \n\n3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it\'s all over. \n\n4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. \n\n5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ\'s average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I\'m predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that\'s more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it\'s a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ\'s yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday\'s close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.\n\n6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren\'t really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.\n\n-\n\nAnd now onto the actual play.\n\n* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**\n\nThese are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday\'s closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. \n\nIf this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say "Wednesday noon", I don\'t actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. \n\nThese estimates are going to be off because we\'re dealing with moves that are far-fetched.

With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.', 'How to play extremely high-risk FDs with 1000% upside. With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I\'ve been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.\n\nSince you all love throwing your money away, I\'ll share how I play FDs. I cannot understate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won\'t go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you\'re serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.\n\nI only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I\'ll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It\'s possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I\'ll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don\'t go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. \n\nIn my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn\'t a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you\'re only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don\'t mess with FDs if I\'m only looking at a realistic upside of 500%. \n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**\n-\n\nI haven\'t bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I\'ve bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. \n\nSo, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn\'t like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ\'s results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn\'t have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.\n\nThus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.\n\n-\n\n**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you\'ll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. \n\n1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. \n\n2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We\'re banking on some unexpected volatility. \n\n3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it\'s all over. \n\n4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. \n\n5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ\'s average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I\'m predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that\'s more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it\'s a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ\'s yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday\'s close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.\n\n6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren\'t really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.\n\n-\n\nAnd now onto the actual play.\n\n* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**\n\nThese are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday\'s closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. \n\nIf this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say "Wednesday noon", I don\'t actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. \n\nThese estimates are going to be off because we\'re dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you\'re trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I\'m not wrong often.\n\nBy the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you\'re down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.\n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Apple ($AAPL)**\n-\n\nI personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I\'ll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. \n\n* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**\n\nThese calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. \n\nReasoning in decreasing significance: \n\n1. Apple\'s earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. \n\n2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn\'t only because they\'re both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. \n\n3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. \n\n4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn\'t a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don\'t go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. \n\n5. With the tax cuts and Apple\'s big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they\'re good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.\n\n-\n\nAs always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there\'s a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn\'t go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road.

However, I still felt that itch to gamble, so I've been putting most of that money into Magic the Gathering cards, as I can not only potentially turn a profit but also play with my physical holdings until I want to sell them. Anyway, the market value is driven by several factors, most notably the rarity of any individual card and it's functionality in playing the game. No one wants cards that suck, and there are more desperate autists looking to assert dominance over fellow losers than there are good cards in the game, so rather than trying to make their own deck, they just see what decent players are doing and try to copy that.\n\nThe game makers, Wizards, in an attempt to keep things level, occasionally bans cards from use, making the card worth little more than the cardboard it's printed on. However, because they want to make things interesting and constant autistic screeching about how Jace should be legal was getting annoying, occasionally the decision is reversed, allowing kiddies to play again, just like how the 21st Amendment made it so I could legally find the will to live.\n\nAnyway, I have it on good authority that three individual cards currently on their ban lists are going to be returned to legality at the start of July. Look at the prices on [Bloodbraid Elf](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Eternal+Masters/Bloodbraid+Elf#paper) in February when this happened. Can AMD get you those kind of investment returns?

I don\'t factor Trump into my initial set, but as the week wears on, I do account for his dumbass shenanigans in my commentary and make revisions if needed. Earnings reports don\'t get factored-in, either way, because I don\'t have the time to go so in-depth -- and we\'ve seen how, lately, they don\'t really appear to have much impact on the markets. Finally, no revisions after midnight or on days where my guesses are correct.\n\nI think the main driver this week will be the Iran sanctions. Oil prices ought to continue rising, but the closer we get to Trump\'s "will he/won\'t he" decision, the more likely it\'ll be that people start taking profits.\n\nAnother driver is the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the trade war. If China announces new tariffs, expect the market to shit its pants. If nothing happens, though, expect the trade war question not to factor in so much.\n\nFinally, Trump: if he says something retarded on Twitter ("More trade wars, boys!"), expect the market\'s dick to shrivel.\n\n**Current record:** 10 correct / 15 total\n\n**HOW\'D I DO LAST WEEK?**\n\n||Actual\t|Predicted\t|Variance\n---|---|----|----\nPending Home Sales (MoM) (Mar)\t |0.4 \t |0.4 \t|3.18%\nISM Manufacturing PMI (Apr)\t |57.3 \t |59.3 \t|-3.36%\nADP Nonfarm Employment Change (Apr)\t |204 \t |228.4 \t|-10.68%\nFed Interest Rate Decision\t |1.75 \t |1.77 \t|-1.18%\nISM Non-Manufacturing PMI (Apr)\t |56.8 \t |58.8 \t|-3.41%\nNonfarm Payrolls (Apr)\t |164.0 \t |202.2 \t|-18.88%\nUnemployment Rate (Apr)\t |3.9 \t |4.0 \t|-2.43%\n\n**MY POSITIONS**\n\n[5/5/18 - 5/6/18](https://imgur.com/XLKfmj1)'), ('NVDA wants it all', 'NVDA wants it all'), ('Elon Hangs Up on NTSB Chief: TSLA ATH INCOMING', 'Elon Hangs Up on NTSB Chief: TSLA ATH INCOMING'), ('How stupid am I if I buy AAPL at open Monday', 'How stupid am I if I buy AAPL at open MondayReal stupid right.

With more than 140 million connected devices installed worldwide, Echelon\'s solutions host a range of applications enabling customers to reduce energy and operational costs, improve safety and comfort, and create efficiencies through optimizing physical systems. Echelon is focusing today on two IoT (Internet of Things) market areas: creating smart cities and smart campuses through connected outdoor lighting systems, and enabling device makers to bring connected products to market faster via a range of IoT-optimized embedded systems”\n\n\nSo they have all these fancy smart systems that win awards and shit. Really cool stuff. \n\nNow is 4Q they made some nice moves, \n\n — A major city in New England selected Echelon\'s IoT-enabled, connected streetlight system to intelligently control 5,150 LED streetlights in the downtown district. Together with the potential for sizable energy and maintenance savings, Echelon was chosen for its proven ability to control and manage the city\'s lighting infrastructure through a combination of wireless connections for conventional light fixtures, and power line communication for decorative lighting fixtures. This system is currently being installed.\n\n   -- The City of Rancho Cucamonga in southern California selected Echelon as part of their LED streetlight retrofit project. Not only will the city have fine-grained control over its streetlights and automated monitoring and reporting for the first time, they also estimate that the retrofit will save over $1.0 million a year from lower energy use as well as maintenance savings. This project is also currently being installed.\n\n   -- A major city in Silicon Valley selected Echelon\'s lighting controls for 5,749 LED street lights. Echelon was chosen for its ability to control and manage the city\'s lighting infrastructure and being "Smart City" enabled to support future IoT applications. This project is currently being installed. \n\nThey are growing rapidly in an emerging space, now you must trust in $ELON because as a WSB member you should have at least 1 $ELON in your back pocket.  \n\n\nImagine going up to that pretty bitch at the bar, \n\n“hey you know, I work close with $Elon” “Really!?

No car payment means I can put my money to work for me, like buying spy ITM puts”\n“Take me now you autistic genius!”\n\n\nLike that’s the power that comes with owning $ELON now the average volume for this company is 16k ..

Also, when putting on a credit spread, the credit goes into your account right away. This will be your max gain and your goal is to keep all or most of it. \n\nWhy a bull put spread: Choose a stock that you are bullish on. Rather than being an option buyer, you are selling the expensive put option (the short leg) and buying the further out and cheaper put as a hedge (the long leg, without this it’s a naked put and your risk is unlimited).  \n\n[Here is a credit spread on AMZN that I opened on May 8th.](https://imgur.com/a/LKdeiQi) I sold the May 18th 1600 put for $2,758 and bought the 1590 put for $2,279 as protection.

'), ('Getting lernt with Daddy', "Getting lernt with Daddy*read till the end for my own strategy* \nI figured since I have some time and because so many of you are interested in options I would make a post to help y'all get lernt instead of spending time with your mom's like the non-autistic population. \n\nThere are several ways to play options other than just buying OTM faggy d's. Notably combining buying and selling or calls and puts. \n\nThe first thing to know is what level of options you're approved for. I use TDA and there are several levels of approval. 1. Covered calls/protective puts - can't even buy options without having the shares to cover them, rich people do this, it's very simple and you can't really go wrong. 2. Buying Calls/Puts - this usually is for speculation like faggy D's and probably what most of this sub does. Going long on calls/puts is a minimum risk, unlimited reward strategy. 3. Spreading, either bearish or bullish with calls or puts. Debit spreads are just like going long on options, but cheaper because you limit your upside, this is probably what most of us should be doing as it's much cheaper than just buying OTM calls that will expire worthless. Then there are credit spreads, or selling. With a credit you define your max profit as whatever you want to sell the option spread for and your max loss as the width of your spread minus however much the credit was. E.g. you can define your p/l risk management and won't need to manage most positions because they expire worthless. This is a great strategy because you can define your risk tolerance and you can leg into it if you already have the long option side to create less of a loser from an older position. Spreads usually have the same expiration date but they dont need to. 4 - selling naked calls/puts - the riskiest strategy which you won't have access to without significant trading history or a lot of capital. Good luck getting approved for this.\n\nHere's an example for some of you to take your trading to the next level. Let's say you buy an OTM call like your faggy self would. You paid $2 premium for this option. It's a $110 call 1 month out and the stock is at 100. This means a 12% gain in one month is your break even price. Unlikely for most companies, but you like faggy D's. You could keep this strategy but it's vularable to down moves and a 5% drop might make your call worth only $1. Now consider if you bought the 110 call and sold the 115 for $1. You now paid $1 for the debit spread and can make max profit at 115 (a 15% gain for the stock). Now let's say you bought the spread and the stock went down 5%. The 115 is worth .50 and the 110 is still worth $1. You lost .50 instead of $1. (Let's just assume it went down 5% in a few days and there's still like ≈25 days till expiry)\n\nI'm going out on a limb here and say this is a better strategy for most people here because y'all are terrible at choosing stocks and expecting huge changes in a month. I shouldn't have to say this but this is a way better short term strategy and I wouldn't do this with LEAPs.  \n\nHere's one more strategy I want to tell you about because it's defined p/l as well. Some option chains don't have crazy spreads, and it's more likely to work on one's with tighter spreads. ITM options have more intinsic value than OTM which is why this strategy is possible.  I have done this and told a few people to do this as well. Let's say that AAPL has earnings coming up and you think it's going up 2-5% but you don't want to pay the premium to get fucked like most option buyers. You want to make an exciting weekly option play and post your sick gains on here. So here's what you do. Scenario - AAPL is at 190. You think it's going to 195+ so you want some high r/r potential without getting fucked. Sell and ITM put and buy an ITM as well, a credit spread so you sell the one worth more and buy the cheaper one. Sell the 195 put and buy the 190 I'd guess for weekly's before earnings the 195 is $9 and the 190 is like $5 for sake of the example so you take in $400 and the max loss is only $100 (500-400) if AAPL dips at all, like lower than 190, you lose 100, if AAPL goes up to 191 you break even. Hypothetically speaking, the 195 will be exercised and you might exercise your 190 to cap your loss, or in my case everytime the option gets exercised I'm just long 100 shares that I can unload when I get a chance or they'll unload for you to avoid a margin call, they often won't make you exercise your OTM for max loss since the shares are protected until you sell anyways. So if it goes to 192 you make 100, 194 you make 300 ect. Going farther itm might be worth it, if the spreads aren't crazy you can sell an itm put for 15.50 and buy for 11 which is a 4.50 credit on a $5 spread, giving a risk/reward of 9/1 which is fucking nutty if you win. Side note: don't go all in you fucking nerds, you only have to keep the max loss as your margin so if you have 1,000 and you sell a .50 spread like I said, you could do 20 contracts, with a max gain of $9,000 or a a 900% return, which is pretty good for a week, or you might lose it all (if you're too far itm, and I know you're going to do this since y'all play faggy d's all the time, you were warned). \n\nI do the last strategy all the time for earnings if the bid/ask spreads are right. It doesn't hurt to put in an order and have it not get filled faggots. which will happen if you ask for too much on the spread. Most of the time i ask my itm spreads go for 3.80 on $5 wide spread.

[Here is the P&amp;L chart for the position. ](https://imgur.com/a/1v2yVwG) Notice that theta is now your friend, as long as AMZN stays above 1600. \n\nAnd that’s how you can use options to trade Amazon and only risk a few hundred bucks. If this helps anyone, I can share some other trades and strategies. '), ('Does anyone use stocks and options to create a short term risk free portfolio? I am trying to do one because my bank pays .01% interest in savings account.', 'Does anyone use stocks and options to create a short term risk free portfolio? I am trying to do one because my bank pays .01% interest in savings account.My bank pays me nothing and even ally has only 1.6%, if I opened an account with them. Risk free interest rate is obviously more than that but I am unable to find any thing that I can buy in market. US Treasury bonds maturing on 7/31 have only 1.636% return. None of the short term CDS are any different.\n\nMy portfolio is this using AAPL as an example. Buy a stock, sell 187.5 call and buy 187.5 put for 6/29. Call is at 5.95 and put is $4.30. So I pocket $1.65. Then stock price is at 188.58, so I will lose 1.08 on that. Net gain is 57 cents for about a month and half on one apple share. The effective interest rate comes out to be about 2.27% which is certainly higher than anything out there and for a shorter time too. \n\nSo I have two questions. Do you see any flaw in the strategy? If not, then why are people not doing this and buying bonds. I am sure someone has though about it. If the answer is that lack of volume than I alone doing this will not move the market but if there is some other reason I would like to know.')], '2018-05-14': [('Citigroup increases NVDA price target to $380', 'Citigroup increases NVDA price target to $380'), ('US Economic Results: 5/14/18 - 5/18/18', 'US Economic Results: 5/14/18 - 5/18/18Dear WSB:\n\nSorry I\'m late!

Investing is my hobby and loosing money is my addiction so be easy on me (which I don't expect to be the case in this sub). Anyway, here goes.\n\nTesla has been claiming that they have a hard time keeping up with productions and meeting demand. However, its balance sheet doesn't speak the same thing to me. Compared to F and GM, Tesla has extremely high inventory/sale ratio in Q1 2018:\n\nTSLA: 0.70 = $2.57B/$3.41B \nGM: 0.32 = $11.46B/$36.1B\nF: 0.07 = $10.28B/$156.78B\n\nAt first, I thought since Tesla includes SolarCity in the equation, a chunk of it could come from SolarCity. Since merging, they don’t breakout the detail anymore so it is hard to find the true inventory of just cars. But on the last available 10-K of Solar City which was December 31 2016, there was detail of SolarCity’s inventory, and it was minimal - $172M. Meanwhile, Tesla’s inventory at the end of 2016 was already 2.07B. So, it is safe to say the majority of inventory at the end of Q1 2018 was from Tesla’s cars. I’ll be generous and let just say SolarCity’s inventory doubled since 2016, it still only stands at $340M which leaves $2.23B of inventory to Tesla.\n\nWhy is it significant? Well, one thing I didn’t tell you was that out of $3.41B sales in Q1 2018, automotive revenue was only $2.7B. The rest was energy sale. So the true inventory/sale ratio for Tesla is $2.23B/$2.7B = 0.82! And why is it significant? Any sane person will know that much of inventory is just dead weight. You have to pay for storages, maintenance, etc. So unless you have a terrible production line (which might be true to Tesla) that you can’t scale fast enough or you can’t get rid of your inventory fast enough, you are an idiot to keep that many inventory just to be safe. It is like they are keeping almost a quarter worth of sale in their inventory.\n\nIn the grant scheme of things and everything else is going on at Tesla, inventory might be the last thing that investors pay attention to, but in my opinion, something is not right. Are they doing this on purpose to keep their assets inflated for financing purposes? Or are they just straight out lying about the attractiveness of their car to lure more customers? Or am I missing something? Help me out here guys.\n\n\n"), ('$AMD &amp; $MU C riding today!', '$AMD &amp; $MU C riding today!GL boys!'), ('AMD puts', 'AMD putsDo i even have to say why?'), ('TSLA DD - Soros now holding', 'TSLA DD - Soros now holding'), ('Susquehanna Bros Upgrade $AMD to Neutral, up 1.5% Premarket', 'Susquehanna Bros Upgrade $AMD to Neutral, up 1.5% Premarket'), ('$AMD at a 83% call ratio.

My thought is it will get fucked so might as well buy a cheap TV and replace it when it shits the bed, lightening, rain, drunk dude, etc.  The cheap TV makes you sign up on Roku and you have to go through a Roku account to get to the cable box HDMI  source to watch TV. Now this shows you being a Roku subscriber and you are an active account. But you are not. You are just watching two fags on ESPN yell at each other about if LeBron is a leader on your cable provider and not giving any money to Roku. \n\nSince this is a cheap shit TV from the largest brick and whitetrash store, how many fucking Roku accounts out there are BS? Someone just made an account to get into the TV to get to cable, air tv, or other platforms like AMZN, Netflix, Hulu, xBox, Playstation, etc. and Roku acting like they are "active users".\n\nMore to come as I dig deeper into this bottom bitch, without lube.'), ('Prayer circle for market surge at opening', 'Prayer circle for market surge at openingPlease Mr Buffett, my SPY calls got super fucked with Trumps little talk after all this good news, and what is still good news. \n\nPlease help the market stop acting like little bitches and getting scared over this when it’s just an orange man trying to act tough. \n\nPlease make the Fed meeting minutes be good and not fuck us here. \n\nThank you, \nYour WSB fags'), ('6/15 AMD Put $12.50', '6/15 AMD Put $12.50'), ('Musk shits on analysts during quarterly call, TSLA stock bounces hard.

This is not comprehensive and it may be considered basic by many people but I feel like it may be helpful. I’d love other people’s learnings to get better at this stuff. Some of it may actually be incorrect so please call it out. \n\n1. If you buy stock, be willing to hold for months because volatility is unpredictable. The market could spike any time and you need to be willing to hold the stock until it goes up to the price target. This applies to buying the dip as well as buying undervalued stocks. For meme stocks this is even more because most investors are afraid to actually buy until they see a crowd buying and have FOMO\n\n2. Margin and options are risky. Always have an exit and escape plan to ensure you don’t double or triple down too hard due to greed. Understand the risk and ensure you have downside protection. Insurance for 10-15% less profit is worth it ultimately. \n\n3. Don’t try and make quick money. It’s far better to rely on buying options for far out periods because your liquidity is much higher and you have a lot more time to deal with up and down swings from the volatility. When buying the dip this is pro as hell because now you have ample time to see the stock rise and can optionally sell or exercise whenever you want to ensure you are successful. \n\n4.  Try and seriously use straddles and spreads sometimes to mitigate downside risk. It’s more complex and limits upside but is worth it to avoid stress and heartache. \n\n5. If you YOLO then do it for far out options. And as soon as you start to see serious gains start to roll out your options for further out. If the stock will keep going up, having options a few months ahead won’t hurt your gains much but it will avoid a scenario where your gains are lost because you held near term options and it suddenly crashed. \n\n6. Don’t buy ridiculous options that are too far out of the money or too far in the money just hoping for a huge profit margin. One will potentially be a huge loss and the other will potentially just be dead weight if the stock moves slowly or sideways \n\n7.  Volatile stocks are great to buy puts and calls on even if you are bullish.  If you see ER profit taking occur then having far out puts that are at a decent strike ITM is worth it in case profit taking makes your stock dip too far. If the stock runs up, just roll it to a higher strike or hold it if it’s far out. \n\nThis gives downside protection as well as potential profit opportunities for times when the stock will dip guaranteed due to huge run up which is expected. If I did this for Mu I could’ve made a killing and worst case dumped it after inevitable post ER profit taking in case it never dipped. \n\n8. Pushing your options really far out removes a ton of stress because you have so much time you can literally take weeks away from the market without worrying. This gives more emotional balance and control meaning you’re less prone to knee jerk reactions like selling your options when it’s at a huge loss because you aren’t sure if it’ll be green again while losing time value or if you are worried the profits will go down and you need to take profits immediately. \n\n9. Don’t trade on emotions. It is not worth it and you’ll make stupid decisions. Take a day to sit and consider if it’s a good idea.\n\n10. Options lose value fast and disproportionately to stock. Make sure to keep a good balance of stock and options so you don’t have your entire portfolio at risk. \n\n11. Diversify your portfolio of options by dates at the least so it’s not concentrated to expire at a specific time leaving more exposure to certain events \n\n12. Remember the market is full of smart people and dumb people. Dumb people follow what the market tells them to do and listen to analysts. Smart people are incentivized to manipulate dumb people to do what they want. Pump and dump and other shit is real. People will not always behave rationally when emotions and money are involved. We’ve seen this a ton with amazing ER and crashing stocks. Don’t expect rational behavior ever. \n\n13. Unfortunately analysts and banks have a ton of influence. Noise can obfuscate signal of what stocks are good and people can add and remove that noise for profit. Learn to read between the lines and don’t take anything at face value. Make sure to read and understand fundamentals before you invest big in something. \n\n14. If you are long on a stock, buy the fucking dip. It’ll pay off in long run. Stocks with sharp declines will normally bounce back if it’s not clearly due to fundamentals or missed profits or signs of long term failure. It may take a while though so be prepared to sit. Options far out are a nice way to maintain high exposure with minimal deadweight investment. \n\n15. It’s worth it to hold out buying stocks/options at the morning open and end of day close because prices will get better/worse. Prices may rise throughout day to fall at end of day or fall early morning after first hour as profit taking occurs. Same for buying. Use limit prices to space out purchases into smaller orders to get better deals and worst case just change it to buy at market if the direction of stock changes\n\n16. Sell your profits and roll out in thirds. It’ll help mitigate downside risk while giving exposure to upside potential and ensure you are still in game while converting gains. \n\n17. Price targets are bullshit and more like guidelines. But they do act as catalysts for sheep/dumb people\n\n'), ('2Pac - Tendies ft. WSB', '2Pac - Tendies ft.

The analysts there suspect growth to slow down in the range of 42&amp;#37; to 48&amp;#37;. I went ahead and did a safe growth of 35&amp;#37;.

IQ's current stock price almost assumes that growth has gone up 35&amp;#37; since March rather than a full year of growth.\n\nRealistically, the stock should be priced around $30-35, but this is understandable as to why it is trading higher than where its American brother Netflix was at a similar growth period because of their new AI competition, board changes, and user growth. NFLX was at \\~$63 a share when they had 50 million subscribers, IQ already has that many subscribers and its growing, and even more free users. They also make about the same amount off advertising with their free users which is great news and have other revenue streams and continue to make new partnerships and release news between earnings. Knowing where there are in comparison to Netflix as a baseline is great because I know that anything below $35 is an immediate buy for me.\n\nEnjoy the numbers, correct me if I am wrong anywhere.

I've been thinking about buying puts on it since it was trading at 350. So I thought this was as good a time as any to jump into options. So I bought 5 contracts at 10.74.

There was fear that Trump will limit Chinese investments in tech and all shits hit the fan.\nNFLX quickly fell below 390. My puts were up to ~17-19 range. (It wasn't a happy morning for me though, b/c my long term holdings were down &gt;15k from the pullback.)\nNFLX was stabilizing at around 384. All of previous week, I was anxious about a big loss from first options trade. So I was thinking it's better to make a quick profit rather than risking big loss from my first trade.\nOn the other hand, I didn't want to close the trade so soon because I really thought that NFLX was vulnerable, and there is a chance that it could crash further. So I took the middle road and sold 3 contracts at 17.95 at about 11AM. (The price was selected to make back my initial investment. i.e. the 2 remaining contracts are pure profits)\n\nNot much happened in rest of the day. I think the puts had a high of ~19, so I sold at a pretty good price.\n\n**Tuesday June 26th**\n\nIt seems all worry about Chinese investments are gone. NFLX shot up &gt;4% in one day.

You could just use the S&amp;P as a benchmark for the weights, but it has sectors that I'm just not interested in, and overweight/underweighting a benchmark is how you create alpha. You could just simply buy sector ETFs and weight them to the benchmark but where is the fun in that?\n\nSo to get my base weights, I used Merrill Lynch's US1 list. Their performance of that list (which is considered their best investment ideas) is pretty hit and miss (been decent recently but not over the past five years), but I'm only going to be using their sector weights.\n\nWeights\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QRzlcMb.png\n\n\nI'm completely avoiding energy, materials, real estate, telecom, and utilities. Mainly because those are boring sectors and I'd rather be overweight in tech and discretionary than taking away from them to have some real estate coverage.\n\nNow that I had my sectors and weights, I just needed to make my own modifications of where I wanted to overweight/underweight. I ended up with this:\n\n* Cons Discretionary: 34%\n* Staples: 5%\n* Financials: 5%\n* Health Care: 5%\n* Industrials: 10%\n* Tech: 41%\n\nI don't know anything about health care, but I wanted exposure and it's a high beta sector, otherwise I would have left it out. Staples I included just to add a lower beta sector to the overall fit.\n\nNow it came down to finding stock picks for each sector. If I couldn't find a couple I liked from the sector, I paired a sector ETF with one stock I like. That one stock can't be a major component of that ETF of course.

They are going to kill earnings\n\nNFLX: Same with Amazon. Their sub numbers somehow keep getting better and better, particularly internationally, and they keep pumping out good original content. Some estimates put them at 300M+ subs over the next ten years.\n\nHD: They beat earnings in May but dropped because of same store comps. However this was likely due to spring being colder than expected. The CFO recently said that since then, comps have been up in the double digits, making the Q1 comps a lagging number, pushing sales into Q2. They've beaten eps estimates consistently on a QoQ and YoY basis.\n\nLEN: I'm actually late to Lennar as they just beat the hell out of their ER last week (doubled their EPS estimate), getting an 8% jump. I've read a couple reports that have been very bullish on the homebuilding sector in total, and Lennar is now one of the stronger names there. Giving them a reasonable sector average PE of 12x put them at ~$90 a share. They also bought CAA last October, making them the largest homebuilder in the US.\n\n**Staples**\n\nStaples have a bunch of names, and it's a typically boring sector. Wal-Mart was one of my first choices (they have been getting better online and are trying to inorganically grow in India) but it was already 8% of XLP.\n\nMDLZ: Staples just comes down to which major company you want to go with. Not a ton of growth in any of them. Mondelez beat on sales/EPS last quarter and they have had a lot of growth in emerging markets and non-classic foods. Their P/E and P/FCF is below the sector average, they have above category revenues, and good margins. \n\nDoing a simple DDM of MDLZ (using a 5y div growth of 11% and ROE of 12.43% - historical rate) gives you a price of $66\n\n**Financials**\n\nXLF is good enough overall as banks tend to like to move together. I went overweight BAC because they consistently are the best performing bank out there.\n\nSide note: I was surprised at how high the beta is on the big bank stocks, consistently 1.2+. Figured they'd be much lower.\n\n**Industrials**\n\nI wanted to skip industrials, but it's too big a part of the US1/S&amp;P to overlook and should drastically help bring down the beta and up the exposure.\n\nDOV: Boeing or Caterpillar were my first two thoughts, both potentially underpriced, but they are a bigger part of XLI (BA is the #1 holding), so I went with a lesser known name. Dover is actually on the US1 list. They just spun off their energy group, taking some cyclicality out of their revenue. They do a million different things, and the new company should be more streamlined. They also are doing $1B in buybacks this year and next quarter will be the first full one without energy.\n\n**Tech**\n\nNot going into these. You guys know the thesis on them.\n\n\nHere is some backtested portfolio stats with two warnings:\n\n1) Past performance doesn't predict future performance but it's a decent estimator of risk and return levels of a stock, as long as you make mental adjustments.\n\n2) FB has only been around since 2013, shortening the time frame of returns. I'll give ex-FB stats too.\n\nMPT stats (2013-2018):\n\nS&amp;P 500 correlation: 0.76\n\nBeta: 1.39\n\nCAGR: 47.3%\n\nStandard Dev: 17%\n\nSharpe: 2.29\n\nInformation Ratio: 2.2\n\nDiversification Ratio: 1.7\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Y2QajTq.png\n\n\nExcluding FB (2003-2018)\n\nBeta: 1.35\n\nS&amp;P 500 correlation: 0.76\n\nCAGR: 29.9%\n\nStandard dev: 23.6%\n\nSharpe: 1.18\n\nInformation Ratio: 117\n\nDiversification Ratio: 1.59\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vWXtsM0.png\n\n\nRemember that Amazon, Netflix, AMD, NVDA, and Apple all turned into giants over this time period. It's easy to find the winners fifteen years later. I'm more worried about the beta and correlation figures than the returns.\n\nThis is what I'm going with going forward, unless a stock just becomes too good of a story, then I'll sell something from that sector and replace it.\n\nQ3 and Q4 of 2018 will be the half-year of no more undiversified bullshit. I'm still tech heavy and above S&amp;P beta by a good deal. \n\n\n\n"), ('$TSLA up 6.5% in Pre-Market', '$TSLA up 6.5% in Pre-Market'), ('Should I close TSLA positions or hold?', 'Should I close TSLA positions or hold?'), ('$TSLA TA', '$TSLA TA'), ('Yes, this is a post about $BAC', 'Yes, this is a post about $BAC[Position](https://imgur.com/a/deB2ngG)\n\nI averaged down once-a-fucking-gain today because I will not stop until I make a profit or I actually die. \n\nI averaged into $60K worth of $AMD stock for an avg cost of ~10.60 while it was at $9 before last earnings. \n\nRed is my comfort.

You could just use the S&amp;P as a benchmark for the weights, but it has sectors that I'm just not interested in, and overweight/underweighting a benchmark is how you create alpha. You could just simply buy sector ETFs and weight them to the benchmark but where is the fun in that?\n\nSo to get my base weights, I used Merrill Lynch's US1 list.

Staples I included just to add a lower beta sector to the overall fit.\n\nNow it came down to finding stock picks for each sector. If I couldn't find a couple I liked from the sector, I paired a sector ETF with one stock I like. That one stock can't be a major component of that ETF of course.

However this was likely due to spring being colder than expected.

This is the lowest price since May, erasing almost the entire earnings rally. Its P/E Ratio is now 5.07. \n\nMU has dropped 14.5&amp;#37; in the past week and a half.  To put this into context, this stock has dropped by at least this much and fully recovered 5 times this year. \n\nAll this over an injunction that Micron says it has not received, brought to light by a Chinese competitor, and even if it is real, it is "unlikely that the chip sale ban will do sustained damage to Micron\'s memory sales within China".\n\nTSLA- \n\nTesla is down roughly 13.6&amp;#37; since it announced greatly improved production numbers yesterday. It\'s actually down 5&amp;#37; for the year overall now. It has a history of extreme swings in price. Why would it sell off this hard, in response to positive news? Was it going to sell off no matter what its production looked like? What fundamentally has changed in the past 2 days to warrant a 13&amp;#37; drop? \n\nAlibaba- \n\nAlibaba is called "The Amazon of China" by some.

A Strangle is a both an out of the money call and an out of the money put.\n\n\nTake this example. Suppose $SPY is at 270, an example strangle would be to be long the $275 call and long the $265 put. \n\n\nConversely to be short the strangle, you just do the opposite. So you short the $275 call and short the $285 put.\n\n\nNow you might ask, why might someone do this? Well the answer on the long side, they might not know which direction the stock will go, but they know that it is going to move in a direction (or that they know that implied volatility is going to expand), so they buy a strangle. This is different than a straddle because you buy out of the money options, rather than the at the money option so that their margin goes down less.\n\n\nNow for the short strangle side, why might someone do this? Well it is to collect as much premium as possible. The best part is that you get to make your broker carry some of the risk, while you get to collect all the reward. &gt;:)\n\n\nNow the truth is that is never been long a strangle, so I can't really give you pointers on how to adjust this position and what else to look for besides an expansion of implied volatility.

To talk about short strangles! As a reminder, a short strangle is a short OTM put + a short OTM call.\n\nThere are two flavors the short strangle. The covered strangle and the naked strangle. The covered strangle is when you both own the stock and have the cash. An example of why you might want to do this is if you own 100 shares of $SPY and you would be glad to own more of $SPY at a certain price and would be willing to sell at some certain price as well but also want to generate lots of premium.\n\nAfter you have trade a couple of options, what you will have realize is that a covered call is synthetically equal to a naked put. In order to spend less margin, you could just short 2 puts and get the same results as the covered straddle. If you don't understand why it is synthetically equivalent, don't worry about it.\n\nThe second flavor of the short strangle, is the naked strangle.

The more fractured the content space gets, and ROKU really has brought down the barrier to entry(see: NRA TV) the more you will see the platform benefit, as opposed to the content creator benefit. That means more hours spent watching third-party content, and is very likely to be ad-supported rather than subscription based.

Plus, the customer data and distribution is valuable for a producer of content.

The more fractured the content space gets, and ROKU really has brought down the barrier to entry(see: NRA TV) the more you will see the platform benefit, as opposed to the content creator benefit. That means more hours spent watching third-party content, and is very likely to be ad-supported rather than subscription based.

This is different than a straddle because you buy out of the money options, rather than the at the money option so that their margin goes down less.\n\n\nNow for the short strangle side, why might someone do this?

In order to spend less margin, you could just short 2 puts and get the same results as the covered straddle.

In a few months I traded up to $16k and have removed everything except $4k. So now I\'m just playing with house money. Below I have captured my strategies. Overall my strategies are to sell put spreads on strong stocks any time there is a dip, or to buy weeklies on really strong stocks any time there is a natural dip less than 1%. Anything more than 1% and I get nervous about it continuing to dip or holding for an extended period of time. Also, I always leave about 30% of my account in cash. This way I can buy large dips. Very rarely have I been 100% invested and it\'s usually only for a short period of time until positions start closing.\n\nI started by trading SPY calls and puts in RH. I would attempt to swing trade during some of the volatility, but I was terrible at it, didn\'t have enough time or money to buy anything more than OTM weeklies, and the RH interface blows so I switched to a simpler strategy of buying 100 shares of XLK and then selling covered calls. I quickly got bored with this so I started buying XLK calls, and the market went down on the trade war crap. So I took this an an opportunity to switch brokers to tastyworks and I kept buying more XLK calls, all about 2-3 months out. I sat on them for awhile until we had a rally and I was about $2k positive on 10-ish calls. I easily could have blew up my account right away but got a bit lucky by being patient. The learning experience here was to really be patient while the underlying stocks fluctuate in price.\n\nMeanwhile, I wanted to practice some other strategies. My overall strategy is to remain bullish. The market always goes up slower than it goes down, but it consistently goes up and it\'s really difficult to predict when it is going to go down, unless you\'re buddies with Trump I guess. One stock I have in my don\'t-touch-it portfolio is Visa. This beast seems to continue to rise over time and cannot be stopped. I started selling put spreads on Visa. Anytime Visa is red, even for just a little bit, I sell a put spread that has roughly a 60-70% chance of profit according to TW. Then I set a limit sell for 60% profit. I rinse and repeat this constantly. So far I\'m up a little over $800 the past few months with Visa and opening conservative positions. I plan on continuing to do this with more and more money over time. Right now I\'m holding Sept 21 140C, which I plan on rolling profits higher and higher as time moves, if Visa keeps going up.\n\nFor my more "aggressive" strategies, I tend to trade AMZN on any sort of weakness with weeklies, typically on Thursdays as this gives me a day of recovery. I watch for a .3% to .6% drop on AMZN. Anything more than .6% and I just keep adding slightly-OTM calls if I can afford it. One of these times it\'s going to just keep dropping and I\'ll lose everything, but till then it\'s fine, right?. All I do with the weeklies is watch, and again shoot for a 60% profit on the positions. The key here is to take any profit once it shows itself. Do not think that it will just keep going up and you\'ll make more money because it can drop at any moment. One day I really wasn\'t paying attention and opened up a position at 3:59pm. I honestly had lost track of time and heard the closing bell immediately after the position filled. I had to sit with $8k of next-day-expiring OTM calls on AMZN. I barely slept since this was more than my entire profit for the year at the time. I was super lucky that AMZN opened up a decent amount and I made a few k profit quickly. If I had held all day, like Chad, I\'d have more than doubled my position. But again, my strategy is to take profits when I get them, and let losers ride.\n\nROKU and PYPL. Both of these are promising stocks and I tend to also trade them on weakness. However I limit my positions with them and thus have only earned about $110 and $180 respectively. If there is a strong dip on some news, I snag a call and set a limit sell for about $100. For these I tend to buy slightly-OTM calls and I rarely trade because it\'s difficult to keep up with these stocks all the time. Something about a day job...\n\nSPY: I pretty much only buy protective puts with SPY. They\'re cheap, and they keep my account balanced on bad days. Just today I sold my PUTs for a net loss, but a daily gain which is helping me to generate profit on what has been a red day so far. I do this anytime the market is up a bit and I buy just enough to balance out the delta on my account. As such, I\'ve done nothing but lose money on SPY, but it\'s also saved me on some pretty red days. I guess overall I\'d probably be up another $600 if I never did it, but that\'s the price I pay for protection.\n\n**Trades that went to shit:**\nSBUX: I hate this stock. After the first dip that was caused by the CEO retiring I picked up a call just to test the over-reaction of the market. I quickly made some money but regretted not buying more calls so I got greedy and picked up some more. The price came back down and I closed out my position for a net wash. Shortly after, SBUX dropped even more with the news of stores closing. Around $55 I picked up a call and, well, it just kept dropping. Overall with SBUX I\'m down $400 this year. Again, not much, but I try to compound little gains over time.\n\nTWTR: I tried to swing trade the recent news and lost out about $220 because I was weak. It came back up immediately after I sold, but now it\'s back down so whatever, time to move on.\n\nRIG: I bought a handful of $10 puts on this around $12. I had planned on holding them for months, but I seriously got bored of it going from $12-14 over and over so I just closed it all out for a $500 loss and moved on with my life. If I want to hold something for a long time, I open the position in my ROTH IRA.\n\n**Boring trades that worked out:**\nAMAT: After earnings I bought 100 shares and sold a covered call for 52.5. When the call was close to expiring I closed everything for a $441 profit and have since watched AMAT be a total piece of shit. Probably won\'t touch this stock anymore.\n\nQQQ: I continue to sell put spreads on QQQ and I continue to make a tiny amount of money. Probably not even worth it as it barely covers the commission. Seems it might be better to sell put spreads on AMZN.\n\n\n\n'), ('Buying the Trump freakout has proven to be a money maker, so I bought 10k worth of SPY calls today', 'Buying the Trump freakout has proven to be a money maker, so I bought 10k worth of SPY calls today'), ('feelin frisky today...20k in NVDA FDs', 'feelin frisky today...20k in NVDA FDs'), ('AMD Shorts Lose $$$', 'AMD Shorts Lose $$$'), ('NVDA rally to ER?', "NVDA rally to ER?Full article: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/nvidia-s-ai-topower-daimler-robotaxi-fleet-by-2020-14646825\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the chipmaker unveiled a project that it says will move the tech out of development and onto roadways by 2020.

However, there are a few key takeaways from this earnings that may have contributed to this big pullback:\n\n1) NFLX doesn't know what the fuck they are doing when it comes to guidance. They tend to overestimate or underestimate by 1 million subscribers. Netflix has a tough time coming up with proper guidance since they have something like 170 markets to monitor and correct guidance is near impossible. This has worked well in their favor having underestimated most quarters, but once every 4 or 5 quarters they miss guidance and the stock will take a massive shit.\n\n2) NFLX content this quarter sucked balls. Like that fucking Will Smith movie? That shitty Lost in Space series? Like where the fuck was content this quarter? On top of that, their most popular shows did new seasons during Q2. We can likely assume that Q3 won't suck quite so much ass.\n\n3) The World Cup likely cut into numbers (especially international numbers) more than Netflix expected. The truth is, this World Cup was lit as fuck. How can some shitty Will Smith MIB ripoff compare with the fucking World Cup, especially when soccer is practically a religion for half the global population.\n\n4) Netflix still beat EPS estimates. This is extremely important since Netflix is borrowing enormous amounts of cash to produce contents during rising interest rates. Their entire business model fails if growth fails since they will be fucked by debt, but luckily they are becoming more profitable even in the midst of a weak quarter.\n\nPersonally, I think Netflix is overvalued, but there are plenty of legitimate reasons why this selloff may have been affected by outside factors and why a quarter like this may not remain a trend. If growth continues to wane for another quarter then Netflix starts to look very unattractive as competition heats up in 2019 and 2020.

DD Inside', "Analysis of Microsoft. DD Inside**Azure (The Cloud):**\n\nBefore I touch on financials from their most recent quarter, which was reported yesterday, I want to look at the success of Microsoft’s Azure platform. While we don’t know the fiscal impact of it yet, Microsoft secured a 6-year deal with the US Intelligence Community for Windows 10, Azure Government, and Office 365 Government. I believe there is still potential growth potential for Microsoft in the US Federal Space.\n\n1. Significant Federal adoption opportunity. 7 years after the first cloud policy was announced, cloud adoption among US federal agencies is picking up in pace. The US Fed cloud spending is expected to grow at 11% CAGR through 2021 to over $3.4bn. The Federal FY18 budget includes a focus on adopting new technology.\n\n2. Six-year deal with intelligence communities. This deal allows 17 different federal agencies to use Azure Government cloud services and Windows 10. This builds upon Microsoft’s $1bn deal last year with the Air Force.\n\n3. US Department of Defense Contract. The win potentially helps MSFT in its pitch for the US Department of Defense JEDI cloud contract, expected to be awarded by September 2018. The 10-year US Department contract could be worth as much as $10bn. Unlike the multi-cloud approach that has permeated across Enterprises globally, the DoD contract is expected to be a sole-source award with AWS reportedly seen as the front-runner.\n\nDuring the conference call last night, Satya Nadella said that “Azure is the only hyper scale cloud that extends to the edge across identity, data, application platform, security and management, and our differentiated architectural approach drove another strong quarter of growth.” Essentially, this means that Microsoft is taking this platform and translating it into impressive revenue growth that will allow margins to expand as the business is gaining scale.\n\nHere's where things get interesting: in their Q4FY18 report yesterday, Microsoft reported that operating income grew faster than gross margins, which grew faster than revenues. This is due to successful cloud growth, which I believe is the future of Microsoft (as I’ve said about many companies previously).\n\n**Analyzing the Earnings:**\n\nRight off the bat, Microsoft delivered more than $110bn in revenue for FY18 which witnessed double digit growth on both the top and bottom line. Supporting this was the commercial cloud business which brought in more than $23bn with a gross margin of 57%.\n\nThe Intelligent Cloud brought in $9.6bn, which is up 23% YoY. This was supported by server product revenue growth of 26% and Azure revenue growth of 89%.\n\nThough people have been claiming that PCs are dying, revenue increased 17% to $10.8bn, which was supported by an impressive 23% revenue increase in Windows commercial products, 25% Surface revenue growth, and 39% increase in gaming revenue.\n\nThough Microsoft reported an absolutely monstrous quarter, it is not without problems.\n\n**The Potential Risks:**\n\n1. OEM Non-Pro revenue declined 3%, which is slightly below the improving PC market.\n\n2. Declining Xbox Live users. Live had 59mm users in Q3 and that figure declined to 57mm in Q4. This is slightly less encouraging.\n\n3. Though the financials are relatively strong, FCF decreased YoY. Nadella said this is due to “reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our cloud business.”\n\n4. Microsoft acquired LinkedIn in order to market its professional audience, however, LinkedIn is still losing money. Granted, its margins are improving.\n\n**What’s Microsoft Worth?**\n\nAssuming Microsoft continues to grow at the rate they currently are, I believe Microsoft should be worth $115. Therefore, I believe its current valuation is actually very fair. In my opinion, its share price will depend on the discount rate applied to its WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital).\n\n[Discounted Cash Flow](https://imgur.com/a/Ja55IUU)"), ('$AMZN CALL HOLDERS HUDDLE THREAD GTFIH', '$AMZN CALL HOLDERS HUDDLE THREAD GTFIH'), ('$TSLA theory', '$TSLA theoryMusk is preparing another huge short squeeze.

Some relevant facts \n\n-MTCH continues to steamroll in the online dating space. They own literally ALL the dating apps out there except Bumble which they have a complicated legal relationship with. Bumble accuses them of suing them just to drive down their share price so they can acquire them later. Who knows. The origin of both companies is both shady and fkced up and I won't get into it here.  It's a tale of heartbreak, internet love and casual sex that turned into real feels but that's a story for another day.  Anyhoo MTCH just acquired Hinge which is Bumble's younger, innocent naaive sister aka An App that allows women to upload full profiles and is targeted towards middle to higher income women who want meaningful shit.  MTCH continues to sit on a boatload of cash for future acquisitions and has so far dodged anti trust regulation because the market cap on the industry is relatively small but eventually they won't be able to buy anymore but by then it'll be too late and they'll own everything (sorta like MSFT in the early days before anyone even knew what Enterprise software even meant).  \n\n**The real shit**\n\nThis is the last quarter where comparison to a previous quarter did not include Tinder Gold.  The comp numbers will look astronomically large.  Gold was a runaway success with users continuing to pay more for extra features. ARPU is up bigly and will continue to climb as the app adda more features (such as the ability to make full profiles and women get to control who messages first etc).  \n\nTinder has hinted to the point of blue balling about a new feature which should add significant revenue. They strongly indicated on the last conference call that this feature would be announced at the end of Q2.  \n\nLastly, Tinder continues to push in emerging markets such as India and South Korea.  Pairs in South Korea is growing and continues to bring in good numbers. Domestically the amount of new subscribers should be higher as MTCH has invested in advertising this quarter at a level they have not done in previous quarters (aka college campus appearances with celebs like Adam Levine, traditional ads etc).  \n\n-For the love of God wait till after Wednesday in case FB announces 'Facebook Fuck' or something but then go hard.

And in all honesty its the dumbest thing for it to drop, we all agree on this... AMD barely gets its shit together and its already close to hitting $20... MU has millions for buy back, knows revenue/EPS out the park. Sets a great tone for guidance. its such a perfect stock in so many ways. And its not cyclical like alot of bitch ass analyists have said in the past(maybe true a few years ago)... Why do I think they are wrong now? Because there is a computer boom occurring right now as we get closer to living in a world similar to blade runner. In all different fronts and not just personal computers is this stock booming. \n\nPlaces like cloud data centers (you know that thing that pushes Amazon and Microsoft to the stratosphere each quarter), AI, IoT technologies, phones, you name it, if it has storage, it has MU and friends.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo how do you play MU? RUN UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't believe me? Look at the last two earning's, month before ER, run up... BOTH times this hoe as gone up from ~$50 to $60 (Last one was $64!). It doesn't have negative shit out (aside from china possibly which I will speak more on). ITs already going up, I am done with the wrestle-mania of tech and switching over to MU.Good luck to apple and the rest that still got a go but I need more assurance and space than just a week before ER.\n\nSo CHINAAAAAAA. Yes, its playing retarded right now and trying to steal MU's patients to copy. And Trump is about to throw in 500 billion dollar tariffs on this country. Both should make you uncomfortable. But now unlike 2 weeks ago, US is not alone on this. EU this week said that they will work with the US and try to get China to play honest. If china is smart, they would try to fold like the commies in EU did. Or else they are about to get hit with tariffs they cant directly counter attack... China dont even have 500 billion tariffs to counter. How they plan to retaliate is still to open to debate (target US companies in china, tackle American debt they are owed, etc). But with pressure coming from all the major countries in the world... It will be interesting to see what happens.\n\nI am actually closing all positions as an options only trader since these past few weeks is the moeny maker for me. Don't need to buy/hold much and risk another correction(We had a nutty tech run where we hit ATHs)... But I will buy/hold for MU which is $10 away from ATH.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWIth all this said... we may get a rocky journey to MU's ER but its more bullish than bearish. BUT since you autism isn't fully charged to utter stupidity. I hope you only buy a Sept 21 Calls at $57.5(or $55 if your a pussy) for 1/3 of the amount you want to invest and add more with each dip.\n\nEarnings is on Sept 19.\n\nMake sure to SELL before earnings!

We\'re basically just trading Monopoly money around. Sure, it\'s backed by the good faith of the government and has value because everyone believes it has value, but what if I decide not to believe in it, since at it\'s core it doesn\'t?\n\nFrom there, consider the valuation of a company. I like to think that most of us have at least a tenuous grasp on how companies are values with DCFs and The Intelligent Investor and all that, but think about it. How does it make any sense to consider what your ROI is for a company in terms of years when\n\n1) companies would never EVER just stop all growth and give you a dividend of all of their earnings for 25 years straight,\n\nand 2) companies aren\'t even really doing dividends any more because its horribly tax inefficient so they just buy back their shares or reinvest it for growth. \n\nThe whole notion that companies should have a """return""" on and """investment""" over a fixed duration makes zero sense any more in the current times. Oh, and by the way, who even decided that a PE ratio should be round 20-25? Why not 10? Why not 50? Sure, you can factor in your future growth projections into the calculation, but just thinking about the basis of how people come up with company valuations in the first place makes no sense.\n\nSo at this point, dollars are arbitrary and the valuation principles upon which we make up the valuation of companies is arbitrary too. So now there is no investment anymore - only speculation on the value of a company in terms of pieces of paper that have no intrinsic value themselves.\n\nThen in 1993 we went and launched the first ETF in America, where now you don\'t even have to even consider the value of companies because Buffett\'s saying you can just park your money in a passive index fund a reap gainz way faster than any actively managed portfolio. And the wild thing is that he\'s pretty correct for 1x leveraged strategies for people who don\'t want to bother doing any research or get actually involved in stock picking. Now, who even CARES about valuing individual companies when you can just bet on all of them going up over time? In accordance with modern portfolio theory, it actually makes a whole lot more sense to just find the Tangency portfolio and just put your money in it because there exists and optimal risk/return portfolio that doesn\'t even have to have any consideration for the individual companies that make it up because it\'s so diversified.\n\nso let\'s just keep on going further.\n\nNow that Robinhood has given every gambler in America options, we can all start messing with those. Well, in theory the value of an option should reasonably follow the black-scholes model, but when you look at the difference between theoretical options price and the trading price (even for highly liquid options), there exists a pretty sizeable difference at times. Who makes up the IV? Who makes up the all of the second and third derivative constants to explain all these things, only to have them all fluctuate with random news events? How can you figure out a change in gamma with respect to time with respect to the size of Elon\'s most recent shit he took last night? Or the average tweets per day out of Trump? Just look at this list of greeks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance) It\'s totally crazy to think that we\'ve gone so deep into the math behind all this stuff just to come to the conclusion that people are speculating on the value of options themselves instead of being anchored to anything either.\n\nSo now, to sum things up, we have SPY or QQQ calls: Speculation on the value of derivatives based on a basket of hundreds of stock prices based on the speculation of how other people will interpret what Ben Graham made up about how to value a company based on the cash flows of the company - where the value of the cash itself is fundamentally arbitrary.\n\nTLDR I just woke up and it\'s 9 am on a Sunday and I need a beer but it\'s 9am on a Sunday so I\'ll hold off for later.

This makes it so you can't quickly compare how much you would return if you purchased options for different stocks. Example: you have 5k and you want to put it into either AMZN or AAPL. You're buying ATM calls either way. You're wondering which investment would give you the most bang for your buck if either were to go up 1%, or 2%, so on. Comparing the delta of the two calls in question would be pretty much useless because a $1 increase in AMZN is tiny while for AAPL it's somewhat significant. And even if they were the exact same price, it still wouldn't work because there will still be a discrepancy in the prices of each call due to IV, etc. And thus the same movement in cents for both calls equates to a different change in the percentage of each (and of your investment as a whole).\n\nSo, I was wondering if there's a metric/statistic out there that gives you the percentage the option would increase per percentage increase of the underlying asset. If there isn't, I devised a way of finding out this theoretical value and I'd like some feedback about whether it makes sense/if the math checks out. For now I'll call the theoretical variable Delta Adjusted and for clarity I'll ignore Gamma.\n\nTo get Delta Adjusted you...\n\n1. **Take the delta of the option in question and divide it by the price of the option** per contract. This gives you the percentage the option's value would move based on a $1 move in the underlying. \n\n2. Then, you calculate how many dollars a $1 move in the underlying would equate to. For this, just **take the price of 1 share and divide it by 100**.\n\n3. **Multiply the two together** and you (theoretically) get Delta Adjusted.\n\nI've backtested it in the limited way I can and results seem mostly to line up with what Delta Adjusted predicts. As a quick example, let's do it with AAPL $210 8/10 calls. The delta is .32 and each contract costs $1.19.\n\n1.    .32 / 1.19 = .27 (so, delta = 27% of each call's value)\n\n2.   207 / 100 = 2.07 (dollars per 1% increase in AAPL)\n\n3.   .27 x 2.07 = .56  (So, if AAPL goes up by 1%, the value of these calls go up by 56% all else being equal and ignoring Gamma.)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts. I'm wondering...\n\nIs this right? Is there already a name for this? Is there software that can do this for you and if so what is it? Am I missing something?\n\nI'll be lurking the thread regularly to discuss and/or explain."), ('Buying SNAP Calls on First Dip', "Buying SNAP Calls on First DipIf TSLA can do it, anybody can.

So he'll take *a little* money from the shorts to cover those assholes. More importantly, let's talk about how he prevents option 3.\n\n**Disclaimer- I have no fucking clue if this next part is even legal. But, [get in loser. We're committing securities fraud.](https://i.redd.it/7jroz9aeire11.jpg)) **\n\nOnce TSLA goes private, only people who previously held stock will be able to buy or sell. And, if you want to buy, it has to be as a ratio of what you currently hold. Sold all your shares to shorts? Fuck off, bucko. Enjoy your dirty scab money. Sold all *but one* share to shorts? Welcome to the club buddy, but you'll never hold a sizable number of shares. Once you're in though, you'll get some fucking sweet perks. Discounted Teslas? Free supercharging for life? Early access to order new models? You bet your fucking ass.\n\nWith that taken care of, shareholders are eager to join the club with as many tickets as possible, and shorts won't be able to buy stock from anyone but *motherfucking Elon Musk*. That's when the $11,000/share play happens. Right now, there's [fucking 35M shares short sold](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest). Let's say the shorts get off easy, and *only* need to sell half of those shares to Papa Musk/TSLA. *That's fucking $192.5B.* Musk, being the generous type, splits it between Tesla and SpaceX. Boom, bitches. TSLA buys out every other car manufacturer in the world, forces them to only make electric cars, and we're all taking vacations *to fucking Mars on a BFR*. That's right, Papa Musk is *literally taking us to Mars* with this play. And the share holders who own that private TSLA stock get first dibs with *premium space-cabins*.\n\nIn summary, fucking buy as many shares as you can and [get your ass to Mars](https://i.imgur.com/nhMp8Dm.jpg).\n\n*Once again I know jack shit about stocks, the world, basic monetary or rocket propulsion principals so please don't listen to any of my advice.*"), ('ROKU write-up', 'ROKU write-upWell, it\'s 5:30pm on Friday, I know you fags are all worn out from your 9-5 at Burger King, thought I would give you a little Friday reading.\n\nSo ROKU had a killer quarter as most of us know. I have been excited about ROKU for a while now, posting a couple of very optimistic DDs. Posted one DD back at $48 but one of the mods deleted it about 10 minutes later for god knows what reason, so if your bank account is looking a little short this week, that\'s the reason.\n\nLet\'s talk about the company:\n\n**The Founder:**\n\nAnthony Wood is this British-born guy who has been in Silicon Valley since the dot com bubble, had a successful exit with his first company ReplayTV(an early Tivo competitor), and proceeded to found ROKU in 2002. To summarize: this guy has been around and successfully building his baby company from nothing to a $5B company for 16 years. That is what I like to see. He has been extraordinarily patient in making his billions. He retains a stake of 27% in the company, so he has some serious skin in the game. He is also a total straight-shooter. Everything I like to see. You bet on the jockey not the horse, and this is one jockey that I would like to ride.\n\n**The business:**\n\nROKU is a "sell the hardware, monetize the software" kind of business. This kind of business is extremely lucrative if done right. Apple would be a good example of this (except that they also make fucktons of money from their hardware). SQ is kind of another example, where they sell their card reader and then try and lock you into their ecosystem. SQ faces competitive pricing from other processors, but on their ecosystem services, the profit has no limits. This is like ROKU, they face competitive pressures on the box, but not on the advertising. ROKU will be able to increasingly squeeze their partners as their market share increases(because it\'s not the customer who buys the box who pays the cost)..\n\nROKU is one of these companies that has leveraged their access to the customer in order to build new products that the customer will enjoy. This is the big thing in tech right now; the reason that AGA is so successful, in a nutshell. The main example is the ROKU channel, but more historical examples would include their app store, moving from boxes into sticks and TV licensing, and etc. The ROKU channel was recently valued by Laura Martin from Needham at $1B. Imagine building a $1B television channel in a single year, because you fucking sell people a box. Astounding. What will they think of next?\n\nAnother fantastic sign is that they are just blowing out estimates every single quarter. It can\'t continue forever, but it\'s a very promising sign. And upgrades, and upward valuations on their assets like ROKU channel, it\'s clear that people underestimated this one and will continue to do so.\n\nPeople who use ROKU products like the products. They are doing it right. They are successfully competing, and winning. Now is not the time to get worried, but to get greedy. Can AMZN and GOOG slide in some features on their product that nobody else has? Yes. Will it cause people to throw out their $199 TV and buy another different $199 stick? Probably not. \n\n**Moat**\n\nHere, you have a product where there is not a huge amount of differentiation, but you have network effects. This creates a kind of winner-take-all effect. It\'s not nearly as extreme as something like FB, but it does exist. One network effect is that ROKU got on all the TVs before everybody else. The TVs get marketed by the manufacturers as ROKU TVs, and everybody hears about it. Another network effect is that ROKU now has a lot of consumer data-- probably the reason the ROKU channel is getting so popular so fast. The eventual goal is to build a bigger ecosystem that draws more and more people onto ROKU and creates a durable competitive advantage. That is a possibility, but I won\'t venture to say it will probably happen. The other thing is called "cost of developers," as Ben Thompson calls it. The more scale, the lower the cost of developers. That is why MSFT was so successful. \n\nROKU is also the Switzerland of this space. They will partner with everybody and that is conceivably a big advantage. Content providers would rather partner with it than AMZN or GOOG, who compete with them on content. \n\n**Valuation**\n\nYou can make a DCF to get any numbers you want, but we like to look for asymmetric upside. I think it\'s pretty clear where the asymmetric upside is coming from here-- a long string of years where they grow ARPU at 40% and/or users at 40%. The downside is that the growth decelerate from 96% platform growth to 80%, then 60%, then 40%, then 20% then 0%. This is very pessimistic based on historical advertising trends, and if that happens, we\'re still looking at $1.5B in platform revenue at the end of it. The kicker is that this revenue plays out for a while, because people take 8 years on average to replace their TV. So you are looking at an $800M annuity for 8 years(let\'s say 4 years, since it includes sticks + TVs), and you can see that even the worst case scenario is just not that bad. I think the likelihood of this happening, is low. Lots of downside protection here.\n\n**Recent Quarter**\n\nIt\'s not any less expensive after that quarter. That quarter was a total blow-out. If you updated your DCF model, that intrinsic value got bumped up by 25%, at least. Don\'t fall for the fallacy that it\'s now more expensive.\n\n**Competition from FAANG**\n\nI like the notion that there is "competition from FAANG" because while it\'s never materialized in the numbers(ROKU is constantly blowing out estimates, not falling short), it makes people fearful.

How the fuck is Musk going to pay for the buyout? How is funding secured? He's gonna pay for it. That's fucking right. Let's take a look at shareholder's options:\n\n1. Sell your shares to Tesla for [$420](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/242/293/d49.jpg).\n\n2. Hang on and get private TSLA stock.\n\n3. Sell to the shorts for *motherfucking dump trucks worth of money*.\n\nObviously shareholders aren't going to choose option 1 except for those Ally account motherfuckers. So he'll take *a little* money from the shorts to cover those assholes. More importantly, let's talk about how he prevents option 3.\n\n**Disclaimer- I have no fucking clue if this next part is even legal. But, [get in loser. We're committing securities fraud.](https://i.redd.it/7jroz9aeire11.jpg)) **\n\nOnce TSLA goes private, only people who previously held stock will be able to buy or sell. And, if you want to buy, it has to be as a ratio of what you currently hold. Sold all your shares to shorts? Fuck off, bucko. Enjoy your dirty scab money. Sold all *but one* share to shorts? Welcome to the club buddy, but you'll never hold a sizable number of shares. Once you're in though, you'll get some fucking sweet perks. Discounted Teslas? Free supercharging for life? Early access to order new models? You bet your fucking ass.\n\nWith that taken care of, shareholders are eager to join the club with as many tickets as possible, and shorts won't be able to buy stock from anyone but *motherfucking Elon Musk*. That's when the $11,000/share play happens. Right now, there's [fucking 35M shares short sold](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest). Let's say the shorts get off easy, and *only* need to sell half of those shares to Papa Musk/TSLA. *That's fucking $192.5B.* Musk, being the generous type, splits it between Tesla and SpaceX. Boom, bitches. TSLA buys out every other car manufacturer in the world, forces them to only make electric cars, and we're all taking vacations *to fucking Mars on a BFR*. That's right, Papa Musk is *literally taking us to Mars* with this play. And the share holders who own that private TSLA stock get first dibs with *premium space-cabins*.\n\nIn summary, fucking buy as many shares as you can and [get your ass to Mars](https://i.imgur.com/nhMp8Dm.jpg).\n\n*Once again I know jack shit about stocks, the world, basic monetary or rocket propulsion principals so please don't listen to any of my advice.*"), ('TSLA business model check', 'TSLA business model check')], '2018-08-11': [('Long $TSLA', 'Long $TSLA'), ('How $MSFT handles its weekly gains...', 'How $MSFT handles its weekly gains...'), ('I was raised in a anti-yolo family', 'I was raised in a anti-yolo familyI was born into a family of non-yoloers.

DD Inside", 'Facebook\'s Comeback? DD InsideMiss the boat on NVDA? Well don\'t be sad, fellow autist, because next week is a new week. A new week for you to lose another 35% of your portfolio, come to terms with your autistic (and rapidly devaluing) $90 MU calls, and long $ROPE. Today I am writing up about FaceBook (FB), which was recently rammed in the ass after Q2 earnings. Here\'s my take on why there is a short term, high profitability play in store, and why the Z u c c will offer us his precious tendies. \n\n**Technical Analysis** \n1. [Bear Pennant pattern formation](https://gyazo.com/c24eebdc543f314ee57a49ab37c5687f) - Simply put, as long as we can safely jump off of the ~$171 support line (and not have a bearish breakout), I see a short term breakout as high as the low $190\'s in the next month. I will go into more detail as to why I don\'t see us having a bearish breakout later on. \n\n2. [MACD](https://gyazo.com/8f63aec72b200644a2580d1e1986f122) &amp; [RSI](https://gyazo.com/8ae20c9a243bd2bf2bc568b439366d96) - Both the MACD and RSI have been pretty strong indicators of trend reversals when it comes to FB, and I see no reason why this would be any different. The MACD line has just crossed the signal line (bullish indicator) and RSI has bounced off of the 30 line and is approaching neutral strength (currently 47 ish). Historically, when FB has shifted momentum like this, it\'s held onto bullish momentum (at least enough to sell well in the green). \n\n**Fundamental Analysis**\nFB is, by far, the largest player in the social media industry. They are well diversified (FB, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus VR, [See Full](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook)) within the industry... they are certainly not a "one pony show." Quite aggressive profit machines, I still see a massive amount of upside. If you had to ask me, the selloff was justified, but simply left FB oversold. Expect this drop to signify a key support line that we seem to be bouncing away from. In the long haul, the experts [are still bullish](https://postanalyst.com/2018/08/24/technical-roundup-on-two-stocks-facebook-inc-fb-geron-corporation-gern/) as well. \n\nKeep in mind that we are in the largest bull run in history. Judge Facebook\'s performance against the S&amp;P and you will see an even more staggering signal to buy.

There really was a time where people didn\'t know what "online" meant. Not everyone had a computer back then, maybe you knew someone who\'s family had one. When I was a kid I played one computer game and I had to have one. It was like 6 years later that it was cheap enough for my family to get one. Then it wasn\'t until I had my own money did I wind up on Amazon-- looking for something to buy that I couldn\'t get at Fred Myers or at the shops downtown. I don\'t really remember what I bought but I remember thinking how cool it was that something I wanted just came to my house. It\'s like being God, except you pay money to do it.\n\nSo sometimes I would buy stuff on Amazon. Usually around the Holidays or when I needed PC parts (Newegg mostly though). There was a lot of cool stuff you could buy on Amazon, like anything you needed. It just didn\'t make sense, because it took like a week to get something you could drive to the store for. That\'s before shipping costs. So, I bought a few things on Amazon from time to time.\n\nI always got my stuff when they said it would arrive. I had never had a bad experience with Amazon really. Then one year I bought my mom a Kindle fire. She loved reading books, so it was perfect. She loved it. She bought so many books. Every day I saw her she had that Kindle. It lasted a little over a year. Out of warranty. So, I did what anyone would do and emailed Jeff Bezos and asked something along the lines of:\n\n\'what the heck mother trucker, your stupid great product failed the questionably short warranty expired. That\'s fucked up.\' \n\nTo my surprise I got an email back, from someone at Amazon stating that Jeff had asked them to respond to my email. The gist of what I recall was that the person told me \'sucks to suck, you can buy the new Kindle Fire HD though\'. I was upset, but I couldn\'t not buy my mom a new Kindle. So, I did. I still shopped at Amazon after a cooling off period, like a week, then I bought some shorts or something idk. That Kindle Fire HD lasted up until last year though. \n\nNow, I buy everything on Amazon. I live in Seattle, so it\'s their testing ground. I get all my groceries of Amazon, with their Fresh Service. I can almost anything you need delivered within an hour if you want with Prime Now, or in two hours for free. I can get clothes to try on for a week and send back what I don\'t like (also sunglasses). Bulk deals are getting better with Pantry. The Treasure Truck shit is crazy.\n\nThe only thing I don\'t buy on Amazon is cigarettes and like snacks or a drink at work or walking around. They recently launched that Amazon GO store in January, you know the one where you just walk in and walk out. They\'re already putting up another and it says opening in the Fall. So, I\'ll probably get my snacks/drinks from there since it\'s close. I think Jeff has something against Tobacco cause it\'s the one thing they don\'t sell, you can buy Alcohol from the GO stores. \n\nEveryone I know is the same up here, some still go to grocery stores but they\'re also the ones who have a family, cars, and go to Costco.

Plus, I can put in an order at like 8 pm to have something that gets to my place at fucking 6:30 in the morning.\n\nIt\'s some dark arts kind wizardry the fact that it\'s always here, always early, and always right. Also, the alcohol selection has pretty much anything you need. Not everyone has this yet, but everyone already has Prime-- well 100 million, but just wait til you can get anything and everything whenever you needed it from Amazon.

Today I am writing up about FaceBook (FB), which was recently rammed in the ass after Q2 earnings. Here\'s my take on why there is a short term, high profitability play in store, and why the Z u c c will offer us his precious tendies. \n\n**Technical Analysis** \n1. [Bear Pennant pattern formation](https://gyazo.com/c24eebdc543f314ee57a49ab37c5687f) - Simply put, as long as we can safely jump off of the ~$171 support line (and not have a bearish breakout), I see a short term breakout as high as the low $190\'s in the next month. I will go into more detail as to why I don\'t see us having a bearish breakout later on. \n\n2. [MACD](https://gyazo.com/8f63aec72b200644a2580d1e1986f122) &amp; [RSI](https://gyazo.com/8ae20c9a243bd2bf2bc568b439366d96) - Both the MACD and RSI have been pretty strong indicators of trend reversals when it comes to FB, and I see no reason why this would be any different. The MACD line has just crossed the signal line (bullish indicator) and RSI has bounced off of the 30 line and is approaching neutral strength (currently 47 ish). Historically, when FB has shifted momentum like this, it\'s held onto bullish momentum (at least enough to sell well in the green). \n\n**Fundamental Analysis**\nFB is, by far, the largest player in the social media industry. They are well diversified (FB, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus VR, [See Full](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook)) within the industry... they are certainly not a "one pony show." Quite aggressive profit machines, I still see a massive amount of upside. If you had to ask me, the selloff was justified, but simply left FB oversold. Expect this drop to signify a key support line that we seem to be bouncing away from. In the long haul, the experts [are still bullish](https://postanalyst.com/2018/08/24/technical-roundup-on-two-stocks-facebook-inc-fb-geron-corporation-gern/) as well. \n\nKeep in mind that we are in the largest bull run in history. Judge Facebook\'s performance against the S&amp;P and you will see an even more staggering signal to buy. FB is not going anywhere, and there is a lot of money to be made if you time your buys and sells right. \n\n**Conclusion:**\nTry buying FB as close to the low $170\'s as possible. I expect this play to unfold within the next 2 weeks or so but buy a month out to be safe. Mix up some FDs and ITM options with stock if you swing like that.

My car, a Ford Fusion (yes, I know, I\'m poor), has airbags in the passenger side that can kill you with metal shards if you crash. It said that Ford was required to give me a rental for free until they fix this airbag issue. I figured they would give me a rental for a few days and fix the car because it costs them $60 a day to borrow these cars from Enterprise. They don\'t even take your defective car, they just give you the rental for free and let you keep your car. They tell you not to drive it, but they don\'t take down your milage (so if you want, you can drive both cars). \n\n 6 months later I am still driving this free rental Sonata and Ford hasn\'t called me to tell me they\'ll replace the airbags or given me any kind of timeline. I asked Enterprise when they expect Ford to have the airbags and they said "IDK man, every other car company that had this problem has gotten them fixed ASAP, but we\'ve been handing out cars to Ford drivers since february and I haven\'t seen a single one get fixed. So I wouldn\'t expect to get your car fixed anytime soon." \n\nWhat kind of POS car company can\'t fix an airbag in 6 months? These rentals are going to kill F earnings for the foreseeable future.

He has done this numerous times with his previous acquisitions such as Broadcom, LSI, brocade etc. \n\nCA technologies is all of this, just not in the Semi con space. \n\nI believe that this acquisition is just AVGOs first foray into a new space because they cannot make anymore meaningful acquisitions in the semi con space without regulators accusing them of monopolistic practices.

(NASDAQ:MU) today announced at its Analyst and Investor Event in New York City that its Board of Directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $10 billion of its outstanding common stock, in conjunction with newly announced plans to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders beginning in fiscal 2019.” \nPay close attention to two things, one beginning in fiscal year 2019 and 50% of its cash flow to stockholders. Two question arise, when is fiscal year 2019 and what is the estimated cash flow? \nWell fiscal year 2019 begins in September. This means beginning on September 4th(holiday on the 3rd) Papa Sanjay will be extract his revenge on the shorts. Now if you want to sell MU you have to sell to MU itself and it has 10 billion dollars to buy the dip.  \nSecond is the part that says “to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders beginning in fiscal 2019”. What does that mean? Buybacks or dividends. I would bet on the former occurring. So how much will MU generate in FCF in FY 2019. A quick and dirty representation of cash flows is EBITDA which is expected to be 19.345 Billion dollars next year. So, half of that is 9 billion dollars. That means over the course of the year another 9 billion will be spent on buy backs.  \nIn sum MU ,next Tuesday, will beginning buying back 10 Billion dollars’ worth of stock and over the course of the next year with a possible an additional 9 Billion. A question, do you want to be on the side that is has 10 Billion dollars to spend on its stock to keep it from going lower? Imagine having 10 billion to buy the dip, that dip wont last very long.

With the rest, I'm planning to buy FDs in advance of earnings run-ups in October. Btw, I'm new to options. To test the waters, I ran an experimental options portfolio for a month on RH with 1K that [did better than I expected](https://imgur.com/CKspWwZ) (positions: winners were SQ calls (earnings), ETSY calls (earnings), AAPL calls, CRM calls; losers were FNKO calls (earnings), FB calls, DOCU calls). But that was just this August just working its magic. I'd be happy just to have a 50% gain in September. In total, I'll be playing with 12K for various non-SQ FDs.\n\n**Got any FD suggestions for the 12K? Or would you play my 25K any differently?**\n\nOn a side note, if the SQ dip never comes in September (trollollol) - do you think I should just get back into SQ at an inflated price before Q3 earnings season or just hold onto my cash lol\n\nAll hail WSB - you are my f. delight /gay"), ('You guys are the best financial advisors out there', 'You guys are the best financial advisors out thereI started investing back in December 2017 on Robinhood and was blessed with a free FB stock.

SK Hynix announced a delay to the expansion of their new facility a few weeks ago which triggered the initial 5% rally. However a rumour going to press in 6 hours on [Digitimes](https://www.digitimes.com/topic/bits+chips/memory_chips/) is that "Samsung, SK Hynix reportedly to defer expansion plans".

They now expect 69.5 billion in sales and a non GAAP ePS of 4.15 (10.7% and 19.9% growth). That doesn't sound like a flat lining company to me \n-Yes, the stock got beat down after announcing a 2019 target date for release of 10nm Chip and AMD has been on a tear since then.  What the acting chief executives said on the call was that they aren't too worried about the server market share since they still have a 99% strangehold on the space and that their 14nm chips are competitive. \n-Significant investment in alternative spaces like Internet of things is paying huge dividends.  Revenue for this alone was 5.5 billion on last call.  \n-Cash flow is a whopping 15 billion and under the current stock repurchase program they are poised to buy back almost 7 billion of stock in cash. \n-The AMD threat isn't new. It's 5 decades old and every single time AMD surges then gets destroyed.  Look it up if curious. Happens every ten years.  \n-PEG factoring in current guidance is a paltry 1.2 which is ridiculous for a growth stock even if threats like Ryzen and smaller chips are factored in.  \n- Stock has broken 50day MA and is testing 200day. Last time this happened was fall of 2017 and the stock then proceeded to rocket up 70%.  \n-When the CEO resigned there was much talk of internal replacement but one by one the execs either turned it down or weren't vetted. Which is awesome. I think the board has the cash on hand to woo someone outside the company very desirable and that this announcement will happen a month before next earnings. The right person will maybe light a fire under the share price ... \n\nTL:DR Intel has a terrific amount of bad press because of AMD's recent coverage but some of us have seen this movie before and it always ends the same way. A new CEO is coming and the company is doing great financially.  Buy stock/long calls."), ('A Bullish Case for Tencent and Shopfiy', "A Bullish Case for Tencent and ShopfiySHOP is at the center of an Ecommerce BOOM! (Along with Amazon, but even Amazon and FB waived the white flag and partnered with SHOP vs competing with them.) Ecommerce currently makes up less than 14% of US retail sales and that number has steadily increased since 2010.\n\nI've found that thesis and theme investing works very well. For example, Ecommerce continuing to expand and grow is my thesis. So who are the best two companies inside of the Ecommerce theme: SHOP and AMZN and their charts reflect that. \n\nMy other thesis is that AI will revolutionize our economy more than the internet did. Data is key for AI and Tencent has data stores that make Google and Facebook salivate. Tencent is basically all of our apps rolled into one so you can imagine the immense amount of data they have on their user base which is more than double the population of America. TCEHY is an AI giant that has yet to execute its full potential (with all that data) but it's heavily investing into AI so I know TCEHY will be a winner in my AI theme investments just like SHOP and AMZN have been in my Ecommerce theme (AMZN is also AI which further adds to the greatness of their business and returns)\n\nThe technicals on TCEHY are terrible right now. It's consistently trading below the 50 DMA which is bearish, but it had that huge volume Spike on 8/15  and appears to be resting on/near a long term technical support level so it might be near rock bottom prices, but that doesn't mean it couldn't slip further down. But that volume spike may possibly be the start of a reversal or at least a strong base around that level. \n\nShop is trading at a freaking steal right now. It's right on the 200 DMA which is a very strong level of support as you can see even from its past price history. So SHOP is in a technical uptrend resting on support and looks poised for a bounce up once this short term volatility settles down.\n\nEveryone is focusing on Tencent's last quarter which had decreased margins. This is mainly due to working under the communist government of China. Tencent owns huge stakes in Epic Games (Fortnight and Gears of War developer) and ATVI (World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Starcraft developer) as well as fully owning League of Legends along with other mainstream titles. Gaming is only one part of their huge business. Anywho, China prohibited them from monatizing their games (such as the titles mentioned) so they're sitting on a huge untapped potential of earnings bc China is playing communist big brother. So they had smaller earnings margins than normal and everyone freaked out. Even in the short term, I think this is overblown given that it's mainly the government throddling them, but long term with AI, these highs and lows it has now will be small blips on its price chart. You can see the power of AI returns in the TTD chart. \n\nIn conclusion, TCEHY is a fundamentally sound LONG term investment, but technically unsound/risky short term investment although it may have found a base, but it's too soon to be sure as it's yet to make a higher high or break the 50 DMA. SHOP is both a fundamentally and technically sound short and long term investment making it probably the best stock you could buy at this moment.

This isn't a contrarian play, it's just simple valuation. \n\nDD: \n\n-Intel's guidance was recently raised after a big beat.  They now expect 69.5 billion in sales and a non GAAP ePS of 4.15 (10.7% and 19.9% growth). That doesn't sound like a flat lining company to me \n-Yes, the stock got beat down after announcing a 2019 target date for release of 10nm Chip and AMD has been on a tear since then.  What the acting chief executives said on the call was that they aren't too worried about the server market share since they still have a 99% strangehold on the space and that their 14nm chips are competitive. \n-Significant investment in alternative spaces like Internet of things is paying huge dividends.  Revenue for this alone was 5.5 billion on last call.  \n-Cash flow is a whopping 15 billion and under the current stock repurchase program they are poised to buy back almost 7 billion of stock in cash. \n-The AMD threat isn't new. It's 5 decades old and every single time AMD surges then gets destroyed.  Look it up if curious. Happens every ten years.  \n-PEG factoring in current guidance is a paltry 1.2 which is ridiculous for a growth stock even if threats like Ryzen and smaller chips are factored in.  \n- Stock has broken 50day MA and is testing 200day. Last time this happened was fall of 2017 and the stock then proceeded to rocket up 70%.  \n-When the CEO resigned there was much talk of internal replacement but one by one the execs either turned it down or weren't vetted. Which is awesome. I think the board has the cash on hand to woo someone outside the company very desirable and that this announcement will happen a month before next earnings. The right person will maybe light a fire under the share price ... \n\nTL:DR Intel has a terrific amount of bad press because of AMD's recent coverage but some of us have seen this movie before and it always ends the same way. A new CEO is coming and the company is doing great financially.  Buy stock/long calls."), ('A Bullish Case for Tencent and Shopfiy', "A Bullish Case for Tencent and ShopfiySHOP is at the center of an Ecommerce BOOM! (Along with Amazon, but even Amazon and FB waived the white flag and partnered with SHOP vs competing with them.) Ecommerce currently makes up less than 14% of US retail sales and that number has steadily increased since 2010.\n\nI've found that thesis and theme investing works very well. For example, Ecommerce continuing to expand and grow is my thesis. So who are the best two companies inside of the Ecommerce theme: SHOP and AMZN and their charts reflect that. \n\nMy other thesis is that AI will revolutionize our economy more than the internet did. Data is key for AI and Tencent has data stores that make Google and Facebook salivate. Tencent is basically all of our apps rolled into one so you can imagine the immense amount of data they have on their user base which is more than double the population of America. TCEHY is an AI giant that has yet to execute its full potential (with all that data) but it's heavily investing into AI so I know TCEHY will be a winner in my AI theme investments just like SHOP and AMZN have been in my Ecommerce theme (AMZN is also AI which further adds to the greatness of their business and returns)\n\nThe technicals on TCEHY are terrible right now. It's consistently trading below the 50 DMA which is bearish, but it had that huge volume Spike on 8/15  and appears to be resting on/near a long term technical support level so it might be near rock bottom prices, but that doesn't mean it couldn't slip further down. But that volume spike may possibly be the start of a reversal or at least a strong base around that level. \n\nShop is trading at a freaking steal right now. It's right on the 200 DMA which is a very strong level of support as you can see even from its past price history. So SHOP is in a technical uptrend resting on support and looks poised for a bounce up once this short term volatility settles down.\n\nEveryone is focusing on Tencent's last quarter which had decreased margins. This is mainly due to working under the communist government of China. Tencent owns huge stakes in Epic Games (Fortnight and Gears of War developer) and ATVI (World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Starcraft developer) as well as fully owning League of Legends along with other mainstream titles. Gaming is only one part of their huge business. Anywho, China prohibited them from monatizing their games (such as the titles mentioned) so they're sitting on a huge untapped potential of earnings bc China is playing communist big brother. So they had smaller earnings margins than normal and everyone freaked out. Even in the short term, I think this is overblown given that it's mainly the government throddling them, but long term with AI, these highs and lows it has now will be small blips on its price chart. You can see the power of AI returns in the TTD chart. \n\nIn conclusion, TCEHY is a fundamentally sound LONG term investment, but technically unsound/risky short term investment although it may have found a base, but it's too soon to be sure as it's yet to make a higher high or break the 50 DMA. SHOP is both a fundamentally and technically sound short and long term investment making it probably the best stock you could buy at this moment.

I try to think like “big money” now. If you can imagine that in your account you were responsible for 100 million dollars, you would want to invest in “good” or fundamentally solid companies. So why think any differently about your measly robinhood account if the goal is to make money?\n\n**Strategy**\n\no First and foremost, any company that I want to trade/invest in, go to their website (I really only play “good stocks)! See what the offer, see if they are a leader or an innovator, or whatever their “thing” may be, look around on the website to get a better understanding of the company and what they do.\n\no Second, I got to yahoo finance and just check over their fundamentals (on the sheets that I had posted previously, use that as a guide). So I want to see good y/y growth, q/q growth, increased gross revenue, good ROA/ROE/ROI, stuff like that. Information that shows that a company is financially healthy and can continue its success.\n\no By the way some examples of “good” companies that I invest/trade/follow are: SHOP ATVI AAXN ROKU SEND TEAM TMUS etc. Typically mid-large caps, anywhere from 20-250$ or so. I try to stay away from speculative plays, biotech, and pennies. Obviously you can make good money trading all three, but for me, it isn’t appealing.\n\no Third, plot out the technicals (support/resistance/mental stop/PT) so that you have a PLAN. If you make a plan, write it down, you are doing it objectively. After that, stick to the plan and don’t get emotional over the trade. Let your winners ride, cut the losers quick (2à1 ratio), and don’t over think it!\n\no Fourth, when plotting these technicals, I **ONLY** look at the daily charts; to me the intra-day stuff isn’t important. Most of us are busy and cant pay attention to the intra-day stuff anyways. If you want, just set alerts on your TOS or whatever app you like about a stock, and get a notification if it crosses a\n\ncertain threshold. Again, you can use different times frames, but for me this\n\nis what works.  \no On the daily time frame, the ONLY indicators I use are 26MA (roughly a\n\nmonth), 50MA (big $$ indicator), 65MA, 200MA (big $$ indicator).  \no Fifth, when looking at my chats, im trying to find “good” stocks that are either\n\nabout to breakout (ROKU AMD TEAM), and you can “see it.” The patterns are very similar, and when you couple that with good fundamentals, you have a very good chance of making good money. Here are a couple examples of what the “set up” looks like.\n\no Do you notice how these stocks (AMD TEAM ROKU), have all followed a nice trend up? So remember, the trend is your friend, and if you have good fundamentals on a company, you can add to an over-reaction (for example NKE and Kaepernick).\n\no Quick example of WHY YOU NEEEEEEEEEED fundamentals for a stock to continue moving higher. Lets look at ATVI which finally completed the Cup and Handle.\n\no Notice the Cup and Handle and then the breakout after, so technically speaking, that is a textbook example of a cup and handle, BUT it only happened because of NEWS with ATVI. They had an upgrade yesterday, which was the CATALYST to that technical pattern. So playing technicals ONLY can get you in trouble that is why it is extremely important to couple your technicals with FUNDAMENTALS. If you need more references, look back at other sheets I have posted, or just use Google/YouTube/etc. to understand more about technicals. The internet is a powerful tool for investors, use it!\n\n**Key Points**\n\no Keep it simple.  \no Think like a whale.  \no Visit the companies website.  \no Use fundamentals as your base and technicals as your entry/exit.o Don’t solely rely on technicals, use them as a tool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso the actual sheet has pictures on it of examples, if you would like a copy DM me and I would be happy to provide. I have been posting other cheat sheets/materials to this sub. If you need more educational material, or material in general, reach out. You can be autistic and a good trader too.

Yes, an electric motor is much easier to manufacture and assemble into a chassis, but there is a lot more to cars than that, the unforeseen enemy of this short sighted entrepreneurs is scale. This startups think that they can be a massive manufacturer just because they can make one prototype. You can make the prototype as cool and fast as you want, that says nothing about your ability to manage a fleet of thousands of cars and customers. \n\n\nThe only ones that are able to pull this off until now as a new player is Tesla, and that will be the case for a long time. The reason, is that Tesla focuses on what matters: delivering the product. You can see this thought manifest in the way they update the cars, releasing hardware features over time, how they started with roadster which was barely holding together, their customer service improvements, ability to fix cars... \n\n\nNIO, Lucid \x10Motors, Faraday Future... all make the same mistake: make a car with unreasonable amount of features, gimmicks, sensors, futuristic dreams and designs... removing focus from what matters. It\'s very easy to detect this types of companies just by looking at their website and philosophy.\n\n\nThey try to beat Tesla in 0 to 60 times with a stripped out prototype and charge faster than a Tesla by swapping batteries or some 300Kwh cable that can\'t be used... when instead they should be bragging about their ability to deliver, fix, update and assist cars and talk about battery resilience in adverse conditions.\n\n\n- When you enter NIO website the first thing you see is a futuristic prototype that will never exist, waisting they resources just to fool some gullible investors. Mercedes can waist their time into this, NIO fucking not. Tesla does not and it doesn\'t have this type of crap.\n\n- They have battery swapping. This is a management hell, costly to install and implement, it\'s absurd on all levels and no one is going to buy this car because it takes 5 minutes instead of 30 minutes, the reason is that most people charge at home. You can just short any company that offers swapping.\n\n\nThey also must start by doing a niche product, catered to a specific audience. Tesla started with expensive roadster for example.

Here with the next play though. Please read through the whole thing and give me your thoughts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlackout. Activision is close to an all time high because of excitement about Blackout. The beta was good, reviews are great. People are hyped. The opportunity stems from the fact that the sales estimates for the New COD are WAY too conservative. I expect Activision's sales to blow expectations out of the water and lead $100 stock price within a couple months. I'll describe my thinking below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMorgan Stanley's latest report has their BULL CASE at around 23 mm units sold. They claim if that happens they expect a $100 stock price. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last two shitty COD games sold about 12 mm. Lets call those guys the Loyalists. They all plan to buy this next game so that's an automatic 12mm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPUBG which is the closest comparison to Blackout has sold 50 mm (same price). Everyone who has played the beta so far has said that Blackout is way superior to PUBG. It's someone took PUBG and had an actual well funded studio produce it. Given that the games appeal to the same demographic and Blackout is just better, I don't think it's a stretch to say that at least 50% of people who bought PUBG will buy Blackout. That gives us another 25mm copies sold. BUT, lets be super conservative and say that all of the COD loyalists also had PUBG, so we'll subtract 12 from 25 and get an additional 13 mm units sold. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo far this leaves us with 25mm units sold. That is already surpassing Morgan Stanley's even bullish expectations. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OF THE SALES. We have to account for the Fortnite effect. Fortnite is a very kid friendly game and they have about 80-100 mm non-mobile players. For many of these players, Fortnite might be the very first shooter they've played. In other words Fortnite has expanded the shooter market. On top of that all of the top streamers: Ninja, Lupo, Courage etc have been streaming the blackout beta. Ninja even had 250K+ for one of his streams for blackout. The point is that players (some quite young) who play fortnite and have never bought PUBG or COD may be enticed to try blackout because it's hyped, streamers are playing it etc. In fact Ninja is even headlining a Blackout tourney at Twitch con. So lets say out of the 40 mm or so of fortnite players who didn't play pubg (some may be Old COD fans like myself but havent bought a cod in years), 10 mm will look to buy Blackout. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat leaves us with \\~35mm units sold, which is almost 50% better than THE MORGAN STANLEY BULL CASE. So point is that there is definitely some upside. that 35mm by the way isn't crazy for a call of duty game. The first black ops sold 32mm and that was half a decade ago, so the market has certainly expanded since then. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway the conclusion from this is that you should just throw your money on MU Weeklies and AMD puts, but if you have some leftover, consider buying some ATVI"), ('Elon Musk is sending someone to the moon, first person since 1972, LONG $TSLA', 'Elon Musk is sending someone to the moon, first person since 1972, LONG $TSLA'), ('MU expanding in Silicon Valley', "MU expanding in Silicon ValleySo we all know about the financial data regarding MU.

Hydrogen power might seem lame but their niche is in industrial forklifts and local deliveries where time spent recharging is thousands of dollars a minute.

The hydrogen isn't burned in the traditional sense, but is instead run through a membrane that strips the electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst and generates electricity directly from the reaction - the hydrogen then bonds with available oxygen and generates water as a byproduct. The advantage of this type of system is the reduced refueling/recharging time compared to traditional electric forklifts that are used in warehouses, and the reduced emissions compared to traditionally powered forklifts. Their systems are retrofit-capable and can be fitted to currently owned electric forklifts, reducing the overhead of purchasing all-new equipment.\n\nThey have also in-sourced the production of the membrane electrode assemblies to further reduce costs ([https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article](https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article)) and opened a new almost 40k SQFT factory in Rochester New York ([https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park](https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park)).

It will increase over the next quarter further as it completes its transition from research company to viable manufacturing company. I have 155 $3 11/16 calls for the near term tendies based around its 11/8 earning report, which I'll then turn over to 3/15 calls for the long term tendies where I expect it will jump yet further.\n\nWalmart, Amazon, Nike, and FedEx have opened contracts with Plug Power for hydrogen powered forklifts and vehicles. Hydrogen power might seem lame but their niche is in industrial forklifts and local deliveries where time spent recharging is thousands of dollars a minute. Their CEO Andy Marsh has also been named to the U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee, giving the business the political connections it needs to succeed. Jonathan Silver, a member of the board of directors, is also a former US Department of Energy official. They are also pursuing European expansion to become an international company, where the political connections will offer them an advantage over their competitor Bloom Energy.\n\nAll eight of the board members have purchased hundreds of thousands of shares in the company four times since the beginning of the year, most recently in late August, signalling that they see a positive future for the company as it has turned around from a research company to a viable industrial and manufacturing business. Institutional investors have increased their stakes by millions of shares - Odey Asset Management Group Ltd bough an additional 2,330,000 shares increasing their stake in the company to 4,910,000 shares.

The hydrogen isn't burned in the traditional sense, but is instead run through a membrane that strips the electrons from hydrogen using a catalyst and generates electricity directly from the reaction - the hydrogen then bonds with available oxygen and generates water as a byproduct. The advantage of this type of system is the reduced refueling/recharging time compared to traditional electric forklifts that are used in warehouses, and the reduced emissions compared to traditionally powered forklifts. Their systems are retrofit-capable and can be fitted to currently owned electric forklifts, reducing the overhead of purchasing all-new equipment.\n\nThey have also in-sourced the production of the membrane electrode assemblies to further reduce costs ([https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article](https://www.gasworld.com/interview-with-plug-power-ceo/2015463.article)) and opened a new almost 40k SQFT factory in Rochester New York ([https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park](https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/08/15/plug-power-adds-factory-in-clifton-park)). They used to purchase their membranes for their equipment from their competitor Bloom Energy, and now that they are producing their own membranes they have announced two new pieces of technology - a new membrane that doubles the energy output of its fuel cell system. They have also partnered with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the US DOE to develop a robotic fueling station and reduces the time needed to refuel and allows the the usage of autonomous warehouse equipment powered by its system.

The company has a flagship product tivozanib, a compound that not only provides a long half-life, but servers as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2, and 3 receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers.  With several partnerships in the works, the company is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in Europe.\n\nThe CEO, Michael Bailey, has been with Aveo for eight years originally coming in as the company’s chief commercial officer, then served as chief business officer in 2013.  In 2015, Bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the company.  Prior to being at Aveo, Bailey worked at executive level positions at Synta, ImClone Systems (now Eli Lilly), and SmithKline Beecham, where he helped market and commercialize drugs such as ERBITUX, CYRAMZA, and necitumumab.  With more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space, Bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the company he runs. \n\nAveo Pharmaceuticals has 6 different candidates in their pipeline with a total of 10 combined indications of use.  This robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product, Tivozanib.  With three different indications, tivozanib has been approved in Europe as a first line treatment in patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC.\n\n\n**Pipeline:**\n\nWith their six different products boasting a total of 10 different indications combined, Aveo shows great promise.  Their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the EU since August 2017.  With an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib.  The remainder of the company’s pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from Preclinical to Phase III.  They have two different sectors that they break their products down into, Oncology and Non-Oncology.\n\n**Oncology**\n\nTivozanib:\n\n*TIVO-1 – 1st Line RCC (Approved)\n\n*TIVO-3 – US Phase III Registration Study in 3rd Line RCC (Phase III)\n\n*TiNivo – +Opdivo RCC (Phase II)\n\n\nFiclatuzumab:\n\n*SCCHN (Investigator) (Phase II)\n\n*Pancreatic (Investigator) (Phase I)\n\n*AML (Investigator) (Phase I)\n\n\nAV-203:\n\n*Esophageal Cancer (Phase 1)\n\n\n**Non-Oncology**\n\nOcular Form:\n\n*AMD (Preclinical)\n\nAV-308:\n\n*Cachexia (Preclinical)\n\nAV-353\n\n*PAH (Preclinical)\n\n\nWhile they do have a robust and outstanding pipeline, we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting Phase II data at the ESMO this coming October.  This data is representing the TiNivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab (Opdivo) in aRCC, as an immune checkpoint, PD-1, inhibitor.\n\n\n**Specific Drug:**\n\nTivozanib is an oral, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the EU.  This potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.  This essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications.   In the US, tivozanib is being investigated in a Phase II trial in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Opdivo (nivolumab) in RCC.  Tivozanib’s distinct tolerability among VEGF TKI’s creates a unique situation where it is a prime candidate to use alongside PD-1 inhibitors.  \n\nThe vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival. There are five known VEGF ligands (A, B, C, D, PLGF) and three VEGF receptors (1, 2 and 3). Each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three VEGF receptors.\n\n\nTo optimally inhibit the VEGF pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three VEGF receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis:\n\nVEGF receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis;\n\nVEGF receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and,\n\nVEGF receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation.\n\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors that is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.\n\n\nWith that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this.\n\nTKIs have recently revolutionized the treatment of RCC while inhibitors of VEGF pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with RCC.  Tivozanib is a novel VEGF receptor TKI inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy.  The unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects.  Also, VEGFR TKIs have shown modulation of antitumor immunity, providing synergy between VEGFR and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibition, showing tivozanib to enhance PD-1 activity through regulatory T-cell reduction.  \n\nWhen tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory T cells.  Where P = % CD4/CD25/FoxP3 (all regulatory T Cells analyzed by flow cytometry), the drugs produced the following results 16 hours after last TKI application.\n\nTivozanib – P = 0.034\n\nAxitinib – P=0.908\n\nPazopanib – P=0.354\n\nSorafenib – P=0.427\n\nSunitinib – P=0.002\n\n\nAs you can see, only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator T cells.  However, due to the specify of tivozanib, its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapies.\n\nThe Phase II study of TiNivo is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC.  All patients are over 18 that present RCC, which is a measurable disease, and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than 3 months.  Patients of the study received tivozanib QD for 21 days, followed by a rest period of 7 days, and nivolumab intravenously 240 mg Q2W.  Dose of tivozanib included 1.0 mg QD and 1.5 mg QD.   Phase II was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib. \n\nIn Phase I, no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (4 weeks) and MTD was determined to be full-dose tivozanib 1.5mg/d + nivolumab 240 mg.  In Phase II, an additional 21 patients were enrolled at MTD on top of the Phase I 6 patients.  In Phase II, a total of 6 patients discontinued tivozanib and 7 discontinued nivolumab, and there was 1 dose reduction for tivozanib (cycle 6 or 24 weeks in) and a total of 17 dose interruptions. \n\nFor safety, 14 (51.9%) of patients experienced 1 or more grade 3 or 4 adverse effect of any cause.  Nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune-related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself.  These include rash, pruritus, increased ALT, increased amylase, increased AST, increase lipase, sarcoidosis, and diarrhea.  The most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63. \n\nPreliminary Antineoplastic Activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at MTD and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater.  Of the 14, 11 are undergoing treatment including 3 in cycle 8 with a partial response.  The results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression.  No patients displayed progressive disease.  The charts indicate that patients who have been treated for 24 or more weeks almost all saw some partial response, giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response.  \n\nAlthough preliminary, the results of the data indicated before a 64% response rate and a 100% disease control rate in patients receiving the MTD suggesting promising antitumor efficacy.  This data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.  The updated Phase II data to be presented in October of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients. \n\n\n**Current Market:**\n\nRCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 90-95% of malignant neoplasms involving the kidneys.  It is estimated that over 63,000 cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the United States and over 14,000 individuals will die because of it.  According to Grand View Research, the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.  Incidence of RCC is highest in North America and Western Europe.  Globally, there are an estimated 270,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 116,000 deaths because of RCC.\n\nWhile previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney, various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs, including immune modulation therapy, cytokine therapy, mTOR inhibitor, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor.\n\nRising preference for novel immunotherapies and immune-oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are poised to displace TKIs and mTOR inhibitors as the standard of care in first-and second-line RCC settings. Combination regimens, specifically those including PD-1 inhibitors will be introduced in the first-line setting to target major unmet needs, giving Aveo a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment.\n\nCompetition in the space includes major companies such as; Amgen/Allergan, Argos Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Aveo Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Exelixis, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.\n\nPD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno-oncology agents.  Again, another position that Aveo has an opportunity to shine in.\n\n\n**Financials:**\n\nRecently, Aveo ended Q2 2018 with $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of $0.4 million, the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year.  Expenses have gone down in R&amp;D and administrative combined.  With a net income of $4.0 million for Q2 2018, the company posted an income of $0.03 per basic share and a loss of -$0.06 per diluted share, which compares to a -$0.30 loss per basic share Q2 2017.  Approximately $11.1 million of Q2 2018 net income was due to the decrease in value of the 2016 warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter.  The company believes that the $18.1 million will fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.  With a market cap of just under $400 million, this small company is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials, resulting in an upcoming dilution.  \n\n\n**Review:**\n\nI like this company a lot.  They have a drug in a large, unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly.  With an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline, I believe they will see success.  The data in Phase I showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of Phase II I believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.  Having already demonstrated not a single progression in disease, it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward, and we will start to see partial responses from more patients.  \n\nI do expect a dilution in the coming two months, however they did just gain value from the warrant situation, creating an opportunity for the company to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two.  Their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development.  The stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since July.  Although, I have no issue buying below $3.50 for a long term hold.\n\n\n#**TLDR**\n\nThis stock has rocketed up, almost doubling since a low in July, but really just getting back up to support zones around $3.  I think under $3.50 is a buy, they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering, but with warrants expiring from 2016 and freeing up a bunch of debt the company is in a good spot to do an offering.  I dont see a short term play here, but I do see a long term hold of 1+ year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small company, big bet to add to your portfolio.  It even has options.'), ('Long Straddles to profit from IV run up pre-earnings', 'Long Straddles to profit from IV run up pre-earningsAlright so first of all, I want to make sure everyone understands I\'m asking about buying long straddles **WEEKS** from earnings not the night before. I\'ve seen too many posts where people buy a FD straddle the day before earnings at the peak of IV only to wonder why they lost money "when the move in the underlying was significant". \n\n**Long Straddle and IV**\n\nSo now my actual question\n\nIV typically has a huge run up prior to earnings, and a huge drop after the reports are released.\n\n1. Is it possible to take advantage of the IV run up by buying a long  straddle far out from earnings? For example, let\'s say I purchase a straddle for $AMD strike price 32 exp Oct 26. Earnings report for AMD is apparently October 24. I would sell the day before earnings to take advantage of IV run up.\n\n**OR**\n\n1. Is it too late to purchase a long straddle now?\n2. Would it be safer to buy options with further expiration and could further expiration affect IV run up and Vega?\n\n**Risks**\n\nI  know there can be a huge risk of time decay, but I\'d imagine the profit  from Vega and increased IV would counteract this? Another way you can  make money from long straddles is hoping for a sharp move in the  underlying, increasing extrinsic value exceeding the cost of the premium, but typically, the move isn\'t significant enough to counteract the money lost from IV crush and time decay.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf  you guys do plays using long straddles, either holding through earnings (not FDs) or selling to profit from IV, let me know what you guys think.\n\nAlso feel free to tell me my line of thinking is wrong.\n\nThanks\n\nNote: Idk why the post got removed so I took everything out that may have been considered offensive.

The company has a flagship product tivozanib, a compound that not only provides a long half-life, but servers as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2, and 3 receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers.  With several partnerships in the works, the company is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in Europe.\n\nThe CEO, Michael Bailey, has been with Aveo for eight years originally coming in as the company’s chief commercial officer, then served as chief business officer in 2013.  In 2015, Bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the company.  Prior to being at Aveo, Bailey worked at executive level positions at Synta, ImClone Systems (now Eli Lilly), and SmithKline Beecham, where he helped market and commercialize drugs such as ERBITUX, CYRAMZA, and necitumumab.  With more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space, Bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the company he runs. \n\nAveo Pharmaceuticals has 6 different candidates in their pipeline with a total of 10 combined indications of use.  This robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product, Tivozanib.  With three different indications, tivozanib has been approved in Europe as a first line treatment in patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC.\n\n\n**Pipeline:**\n\nWith their six different products boasting a total of 10 different indications combined, Aveo shows great promise.  Their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the EU since August 2017.  With an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib.  The remainder of the company’s pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from Preclinical to Phase III.  They have two different sectors that they break their products down into, Oncology and Non-Oncology.\n\n**Oncology**\n\nTivozanib:\n\n*TIVO-1 – 1st Line RCC (Approved)\n\n*TIVO-3 – US Phase III Registration Study in 3rd Line RCC (Phase III)\n\n*TiNivo – +Opdivo RCC (Phase II)\n\n\nFiclatuzumab:\n\n*SCCHN (Investigator) (Phase II)\n\n*Pancreatic (Investigator) (Phase I)\n\n*AML (Investigator) (Phase I)\n\n\nAV-203:\n\n*Esophageal Cancer (Phase 1)\n\n\n**Non-Oncology**\n\nOcular Form:\n\n*AMD (Preclinical)\n\nAV-308:\n\n*Cachexia (Preclinical)\n\nAV-353\n\n*PAH (Preclinical)\n\n\nWhile they do have a robust and outstanding pipeline, we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting Phase II data at the ESMO this coming October.  This data is representing the TiNivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab (Opdivo) in aRCC, as an immune checkpoint, PD-1, inhibitor.\n\n\n**Specific Drug:**\n\nTivozanib is an oral, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the EU.  This potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.  This essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications.   In the US, tivozanib is being investigated in a Phase II trial in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Opdivo (nivolumab) in RCC.  Tivozanib’s distinct tolerability among VEGF TKI’s creates a unique situation where it is a prime candidate to use alongside PD-1 inhibitors.  \n\nThe vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival. There are five known VEGF ligands (A, B, C, D, PLGF) and three VEGF receptors (1, 2 and 3). Each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three VEGF receptors.\n\n\nTo optimally inhibit the VEGF pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three VEGF receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis:\n\nVEGF receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis;\n\nVEGF receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and,\n\nVEGF receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation.\n\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors that is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.\n\n\nWith that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this.\n\nTKIs have recently revolutionized the treatment of RCC while inhibitors of VEGF pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with RCC.  Tivozanib is a novel VEGF receptor TKI inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy.  The unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects.  Also, VEGFR TKIs have shown modulation of antitumor immunity, providing synergy between VEGFR and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibition, showing tivozanib to enhance PD-1 activity through regulatory T-cell reduction.  \n\nWhen tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory T cells.  Where P = % CD4/CD25/FoxP3 (all regulatory T Cells analyzed by flow cytometry), the drugs produced the following results 16 hours after last TKI application.\n\nTivozanib – P = 0.034\n\nAxitinib – P=0.908\n\nPazopanib – P=0.354\n\nSorafenib – P=0.427\n\nSunitinib – P=0.002\n\n\nAs you can see, only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator T cells.  However, due to the specify of tivozanib, its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapies.\n\nThe Phase II study of TiNivo is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC.  All patients are over 18 that present RCC, which is a measurable disease, and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than 3 months.  Patients of the study received tivozanib QD for 21 days, followed by a rest period of 7 days, and nivolumab intravenously 240 mg Q2W.  Dose of tivozanib included 1.0 mg QD and 1.5 mg QD.   Phase II was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib. \n\nIn Phase I, no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (4 weeks) and MTD was determined to be full-dose tivozanib 1.5mg/d + nivolumab 240 mg.  In Phase II, an additional 21 patients were enrolled at MTD on top of the Phase I 6 patients.  In Phase II, a total of 6 patients discontinued tivozanib and 7 discontinued nivolumab, and there was 1 dose reduction for tivozanib (cycle 6 or 24 weeks in) and a total of 17 dose interruptions. \n\nFor safety, 14 (51.9%) of patients experienced 1 or more grade 3 or 4 adverse effect of any cause.  Nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune-related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself.  These include rash, pruritus, increased ALT, increased amylase, increased AST, increase lipase, sarcoidosis, and diarrhea.  The most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63. \n\nPreliminary Antineoplastic Activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at MTD and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater.  Of the 14, 11 are undergoing treatment including 3 in cycle 8 with a partial response.  The results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression.  No patients displayed progressive disease.  The charts indicate that patients who have been treated for 24 or more weeks almost all saw some partial response, giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response.  \n\nAlthough preliminary, the results of the data indicated before a 64% response rate and a 100% disease control rate in patients receiving the MTD suggesting promising antitumor efficacy.  This data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.  The updated Phase II data to be presented in October of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients. \n\n\n**Current Market:**\n\nRCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 90-95% of malignant neoplasms involving the kidneys.  It is estimated that over 63,000 cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the United States and over 14,000 individuals will die because of it.  According to Grand View Research, the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.  Incidence of RCC is highest in North America and Western Europe.  Globally, there are an estimated 270,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 116,000 deaths because of RCC.\n\nWhile previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney, various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs, including immune modulation therapy, cytokine therapy, mTOR inhibitor, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor.\n\nRising preference for novel immunotherapies and immune-oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are poised to displace TKIs and mTOR inhibitors as the standard of care in first-and second-line RCC settings. Combination regimens, specifically those including PD-1 inhibitors will be introduced in the first-line setting to target major unmet needs, giving Aveo a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment.\n\nCompetition in the space includes major companies such as; Amgen/Allergan, Argos Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Aveo Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Exelixis, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.\n\nPD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno-oncology agents.  Again, another position that Aveo has an opportunity to shine in.\n\n\n**Financials:**\n\nRecently, Aveo ended Q2 2018 with $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of $0.4 million, the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year.  Expenses have gone down in R&amp;D and administrative combined.  With a net income of $4.0 million for Q2 2018, the company posted an income of $0.03 per basic share and a loss of -$0.06 per diluted share, which compares to a -$0.30 loss per basic share Q2 2017.  Approximately $11.1 million of Q2 2018 net income was due to the decrease in value of the 2016 warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter.  The company believes that the $18.1 million will fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.  With a market cap of just under $400 million, this small company is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials, resulting in an upcoming dilution.  \n\n\n**Review:**\n\nI like this company a lot.  They have a drug in a large, unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly.  With an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline, I believe they will see success.  The data in Phase I showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of Phase II I believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.  Having already demonstrated not a single progression in disease, it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward, and we will start to see partial responses from more patients.  \n\nI do expect a dilution in the coming two months, however they did just gain value from the warrant situation, creating an opportunity for the company to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two.  Their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development.  The stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since July.  Although, I have no issue buying below $3.50 for a long term hold.\n\n\n#**TLDR**\n\nThis stock has rocketed up, almost doubling since a low in July, but really just getting back up to support zones around $3.  I think under $3.50 is a buy, they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering, but with warrants expiring from 2016 and freeing up a bunch of debt the company is in a good spot to do an offering.  I dont see a short term play here, but I do see a long term hold of 1+ year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small company, big bet to add to your portfolio.  It even has options.'), ('Long Straddles to profit from IV run up pre-earnings', 'Long Straddles to profit from IV run up pre-earningsAlright so first of all, I want to make sure everyone understands I\'m asking about buying long straddles **WEEKS** from earnings not the night before. I\'ve seen too many posts where people buy a FD straddle the day before earnings at the peak of IV only to wonder why they lost money "when the move in the underlying was significant". \n\n**Long Straddle and IV**\n\nSo now my actual question\n\nIV typically has a huge run up prior to earnings, and a huge drop after the reports are released.\n\n1. Is it possible to take advantage of the IV run up by buying a long  straddle far out from earnings? For example, let\'s say I purchase a straddle for $AMD strike price 32 exp Oct 26. Earnings report for AMD is apparently October 24. I would sell the day before earnings to take advantage of IV run up.\n\n**OR**\n\n1. Is it too late to purchase a long straddle now?\n2. Would it be safer to buy options with further expiration and could further expiration affect IV run up and Vega?\n\n**Risks**\n\nI  know there can be a huge risk of time decay, but I\'d imagine the profit  from Vega and increased IV would counteract this? Another way you can  make money from long straddles is hoping for a sharp move in the  underlying, increasing extrinsic value exceeding the cost of the premium, but typically, the move isn\'t significant enough to counteract the money lost from IV crush and time decay.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf  you guys do plays using long straddles, either holding through earnings (not FDs) or selling to profit from IV, let me know what you guys think.\n\nAlso feel free to tell me my line of thinking is wrong.\n\nThanks\n\nNote: Idk why the post got removed so I took everything out that may have been considered offensive.

The company has a flagship product tivozanib, a compound that not only provides a long half-life, but servers as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2, and 3 receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers.  With several partnerships in the works, the company is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in Europe.\n\nThe CEO, Michael Bailey, has been with Aveo for eight years originally coming in as the company’s chief commercial officer, then served as chief business officer in 2013.  In 2015, Bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the company.  Prior to being at Aveo, Bailey worked at executive level positions at Synta, ImClone Systems (now Eli Lilly), and SmithKline Beecham, where he helped market and commercialize drugs such as ERBITUX, CYRAMZA, and necitumumab.  With more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space, Bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the company he runs. \n\nAveo Pharmaceuticals has 6 different candidates in their pipeline with a total of 10 combined indications of use.  This robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product, Tivozanib.  With three different indications, tivozanib has been approved in Europe as a first line treatment in patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC.\n\n\n**Pipeline:**\n\nWith their six different products boasting a total of 10 different indications combined, Aveo shows great promise.  Their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the EU since August 2017.  With an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib.  The remainder of the company’s pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from Preclinical to Phase III.  They have two different sectors that they break their products down into, Oncology and Non-Oncology.\n\n**Oncology**\n\nTivozanib:\n\n*TIVO-1 – 1st Line RCC (Approved)\n\n*TIVO-3 – US Phase III Registration Study in 3rd Line RCC (Phase III)\n\n*TiNivo – +Opdivo RCC (Phase II)\n\n\nFiclatuzumab:\n\n*SCCHN (Investigator) (Phase II)\n\n*Pancreatic (Investigator) (Phase I)\n\n*AML (Investigator) (Phase I)\n\n\nAV-203:\n\n*Esophageal Cancer (Phase 1)\n\n\n**Non-Oncology**\n\nOcular Form:\n\n*AMD (Preclinical)\n\nAV-308:\n\n*Cachexia (Preclinical)\n\nAV-353\n\n*PAH (Preclinical)\n\n\nWhile they do have a robust and outstanding pipeline, we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting Phase II data at the ESMO this coming October.  This data is representing the TiNivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab (Opdivo) in aRCC, as an immune checkpoint, PD-1, inhibitor.\n\n\n**Specific Drug:**\n\nTivozanib is an oral, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the EU.  This potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.  This essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications.   In the US, tivozanib is being investigated in a Phase II trial in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Opdivo (nivolumab) in RCC.  Tivozanib’s distinct tolerability among VEGF TKI’s creates a unique situation where it is a prime candidate to use alongside PD-1 inhibitors.  \n\nThe vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival. There are five known VEGF ligands (A, B, C, D, PLGF) and three VEGF receptors (1, 2 and 3). Each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three VEGF receptors.\n\n\nTo optimally inhibit the VEGF pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three VEGF receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis:\n\nVEGF receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis;\n\nVEGF receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and,\n\nVEGF receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation.\n\nPreclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors that is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.\n\n\nWith that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this.\n\nTKIs have recently revolutionized the treatment of RCC while inhibitors of VEGF pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with RCC.  Tivozanib is a novel VEGF receptor TKI inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy.  The unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects.  Also, VEGFR TKIs have shown modulation of antitumor immunity, providing synergy between VEGFR and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibition, showing tivozanib to enhance PD-1 activity through regulatory T-cell reduction.  \n\nWhen tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory T cells.  Where P = % CD4/CD25/FoxP3 (all regulatory T Cells analyzed by flow cytometry), the drugs produced the following results 16 hours after last TKI application.\n\nTivozanib – P = 0.034\n\nAxitinib – P=0.908\n\nPazopanib – P=0.354\n\nSorafenib – P=0.427\n\nSunitinib – P=0.002\n\n\nAs you can see, only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator T cells.  However, due to the specify of tivozanib, its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapies.\n\nThe Phase II study of TiNivo is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC.  All patients are over 18 that present RCC, which is a measurable disease, and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than 3 months.  Patients of the study received tivozanib QD for 21 days, followed by a rest period of 7 days, and nivolumab intravenously 240 mg Q2W.  Dose of tivozanib included 1.0 mg QD and 1.5 mg QD.   Phase II was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib. \n\nIn Phase I, no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (4 weeks) and MTD was determined to be full-dose tivozanib 1.5mg/d + nivolumab 240 mg.  In Phase II, an additional 21 patients were enrolled at MTD on top of the Phase I 6 patients.  In Phase II, a total of 6 patients discontinued tivozanib and 7 discontinued nivolumab, and there was 1 dose reduction for tivozanib (cycle 6 or 24 weeks in) and a total of 17 dose interruptions. \n\nFor safety, 14 (51.9%) of patients experienced 1 or more grade 3 or 4 adverse effect of any cause.  Nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune-related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself.  These include rash, pruritus, increased ALT, increased amylase, increased AST, increase lipase, sarcoidosis, and diarrhea.  The most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63. \n\nPreliminary Antineoplastic Activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at MTD and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater.  Of the 14, 11 are undergoing treatment including 3 in cycle 8 with a partial response.  The results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression.  No patients displayed progressive disease.  The charts indicate that patients who have been treated for 24 or more weeks almost all saw some partial response, giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response.  \n\nAlthough preliminary, the results of the data indicated before a 64% response rate and a 100% disease control rate in patients receiving the MTD suggesting promising antitumor efficacy.  This data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.  The updated Phase II data to be presented in October of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients. \n\n\n**Current Market:**\n\nRCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 90-95% of malignant neoplasms involving the kidneys.  It is estimated that over 63,000 cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the United States and over 14,000 individuals will die because of it.  According to Grand View Research, the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.  Incidence of RCC is highest in North America and Western Europe.  Globally, there are an estimated 270,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 116,000 deaths because of RCC.\n\nWhile previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney, various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs, including immune modulation therapy, cytokine therapy, mTOR inhibitor, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor.\n\nRising preference for novel immunotherapies and immune-oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are poised to displace TKIs and mTOR inhibitors as the standard of care in first-and second-line RCC settings. Combination regimens, specifically those including PD-1 inhibitors will be introduced in the first-line setting to target major unmet needs, giving Aveo a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment.\n\nCompetition in the space includes major companies such as; Amgen/Allergan, Argos Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Aveo Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Exelixis, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.\n\nPD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno-oncology agents.  Again, another position that Aveo has an opportunity to shine in.\n\n\n**Financials:**\n\nRecently, Aveo ended Q2 2018 with $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of $0.4 million, the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year.  Expenses have gone down in R&amp;D and administrative combined.  With a net income of $4.0 million for Q2 2018, the company posted an income of $0.03 per basic share and a loss of -$0.06 per diluted share, which compares to a -$0.30 loss per basic share Q2 2017.  Approximately $11.1 million of Q2 2018 net income was due to the decrease in value of the 2016 warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter.  The company believes that the $18.1 million will fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.  With a market cap of just under $400 million, this small company is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials, resulting in an upcoming dilution.  \n\n\n**Review:**\n\nI like this company a lot.  They have a drug in a large, unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly.  With an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline, I believe they will see success.  The data in Phase I showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of Phase II I believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.  Having already demonstrated not a single progression in disease, it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward, and we will start to see partial responses from more patients.  \n\nI do expect a dilution in the coming two months, however they did just gain value from the warrant situation, creating an opportunity for the company to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two.  Their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development.  The stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since July.  Although, I have no issue buying below $3.50 for a long term hold.\n\n\n#**TLDR**\n\nThis stock has rocketed up, almost doubling since a low in July, but really just getting back up to support zones around $3.  I think under $3.50 is a buy, they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering, but with warrants expiring from 2016 and freeing up a bunch of debt the company is in a good spot to do an offering.  I dont see a short term play here, but I do see a long term hold of 1+ year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small company, big bet to add to your portfolio.  It even has options.'), ('Long Straddles to profit from IV run up pre-earnings', 'Long Straddles to profit from IV run up pre-earningsAlright so first of all, I want to make sure everyone understands I\'m asking about buying long straddles **WEEKS** from earnings not the night before. I\'ve seen too many posts where people buy a FD straddle the day before earnings at the peak of IV only to wonder why they lost money "when the move in the underlying was significant". \n\n**Long Straddle and IV**\n\nSo now my actual question\n\nIV typically has a huge run up prior to earnings, and a huge drop after the reports are released.\n\n1. Is it possible to take advantage of the IV run up by buying a long  straddle far out from earnings? For example, let\'s say I purchase a straddle for $AMD strike price 32 exp Oct 26. Earnings report for AMD is apparently October 24. I would sell the day before earnings to take advantage of IV run up.\n\n**OR**\n\n1. Is it too late to purchase a long straddle now?\n2. Would it be safer to buy options with further expiration and could further expiration affect IV run up and Vega?\n\n**Risks**\n\nI  know there can be a huge risk of time decay, but I\'d imagine the profit  from Vega and increased IV would counteract this? Another way you can  make money from long straddles is hoping for a sharp move in the  underlying, increasing extrinsic value exceeding the cost of the premium, but typically, the move isn\'t significant enough to counteract the money lost from IV crush and time decay.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf  you guys do plays using long straddles, either holding through earnings (not FDs) or selling to profit from IV, let me know what you guys think.\n\nAlso feel free to tell me my line of thinking is wrong.\n\nThanks\n\nNote: Idk why the post got removed so I took everything out that may have been considered offensive.

The FDA approval yesterday was for kids' version of Symjepi  (its original version was approved awhile back). \n\n# How is Symjepi different from EpiPen?\n\nSymjepi is a manual syringe, and EpiPen is an auto-injector (Demonstration video will be provided later).\n\n# Advantage of Symjepi (aka reasons that people think it will be big)\n\n1. **Easier to Use:** ADMP's study shows that untrained people (aged 12-17) have 100% successful rate with Symjepi and only have 88% successful rate with EpiPen because they incorrectly injected their thumbs (sample size for both group is 34). \n\n2. **Price:** Symjepi is supposed to be cheaper (EpiPen is like $600, and Symjepi is going to be cheaper, although ADMP hasn't announced a price).\n\n# Reasons that I believe Symjepi will have a hard time competing\n\n1. **Other Competitors:** There are other competitors in the market besides EpiPen. For example, Auvi-Q is one of them and damn they are superior than EpiPen already. Just watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AerwbhkJjB8). Auvi-Q has voice instructions, a shorter injection time and a more compact packaging than an Epipen, and Auvi-Q can be covered completely by your insurance company if your income is below 100K. \n\n2. **Emergency Situation:** Imagine this: you are allergic to bee stings and just got stung by bees. There are two things in front of you for you to use to avoid death (assuming you do not want to die because of your hope of AMD mooning): a manual syringe that you have to stick the needle into your thigh by yourself and push the plunger all the way down, or an auto-injector with voice instruction that you only have to hold it against your thigh, which will likely be covered by your insurance because your bank account got fucked by MU? (not asking you heroin users. ykw, actually if you think about it, it might be a great idea to have heroin auto-injectors) And you can also see that in a life threatening situation like this, most people wouldn't mind spending a little bit more, and this really defeats one of Symjepi's main advantages. \n\n3. **The study is Quite Unfair:** Of course Symjepi has a higher successful rate because it's a syringe. And I believe Auvi-Q will have higher successful rate than EpiPen, too, which can be similar to Symjepi. \n\n**TL;DR:** What would you choose in a life emergency situation: manually sticking a needle into your thigh and plunge all dosage down, or use any one of [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AerwbhkJjB8) where the third one can be likely covered by your insurance?\n\n\n"), ('Me when people ask about my tsla shares today', 'Me when people ask about my tsla shares today&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/25y1cb4snzo11.jpg'), ('Let’s do this TSLA!
