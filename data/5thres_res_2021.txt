Sure, can now get money from selling the electricity to you, selling solar panels, or whatever. if Tesla won\'t face problems in China they will have a huge growth in the next 5 years, and the bubble will continue. But eventually, there will be nowhere to grow, and the stock will "crush like a souffle".\n\n**Another very important point:**\n\nWhen cars become full autonomous, most families won\'t have to own more than one car, It will just pick up everyone in separate times.\n\nIf you, your wife, and her boyfriend need to drive in concurrent  time to your jobs in the morning, it can just drop everyone where they need. I doubt that people will even own cars. Power will be so inexpensive, and no driver will be needed. I think that a concept like Amazon\'s zoox is much more viable in 10 years from now. Amazon can also easily make itself a taxi company by creating some kind of a new car, will the profits justify the valuation? as long as they will **absolutely dominate** China, India, Europe, and USA and won\'t grow (in terms of stonks) more than 3x in the next 10 years then I think it is cool. The problem is that with the craze that\'s going on I can absolutely believe that it will 3x this year alone.\n\nGood bye everyone, see you in 2022 when I\'ll once again regret for not buying.'), ('Thanks Elon!

As the results became more clear last night, futures took a deep dive particularly for NQ, while conversely small caps enjoys a favorable bump. The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. \n\n* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.\n\n* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.\n\n* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).\n\n* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.\n\n* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.\n\n* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.\n\n* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):\n\n    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. \n\n    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. \n\n    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.\n\n* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&amp;P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts.

The market opened deeply red for QQQ as big tech retreated with renew fear on antitrust probes  and overall an unfriendly corporate environment as Democrats will control WH and both chambers of Congress. \n\n* By early morning, the sell-off quickly reversed and big tech recovered most of their red, with big tech such as AAPL going from -3% to just shy of yesterday's close during day's high. In contrast to big tech, clean tech and weed soared on Dems securing the Senate. ICLN was up almost 4% during pre-market and as high as 9% during intraday high and HASI was up 10% during intraday high. Weed stock such as TLRY was up as high as 21%, ACB as high as 11%+, and APHA as high as 14%.\n\n* Things quickly pulled back and tech started fading in earnest at 2:15 PM ET when protestors [cosplaying as revolutionaries](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106820104-1609961746992-gettyimages-1230453313-AFP_8YA6MW.jpg) stormed the capitol and Congress had to quickly pause their certifying of the Electoral College votes. Shit got real when a lady got shot as these protestors attempt to storm the [barricaded House chamber](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1600/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F210106150417-03-house-chamber-0106.jpg) while Reps were still in the building.\n\n* The sell-off accelerated for AAPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT, and NFLX as most drilled back to opening lows by EOD. AAPL closed the day -3.37% to $126.60, AMZN -2.49% to $3,138, FB -2.83% to $263, MSFT -2.59% to $212, and NFLX -3.9% to $500.49. Thanks to overall negative sentiment of all things tech, QQQ closed the day red at -1.39% to $307 (retreating quite a bit more than IXIC given the weigh of big tech in QQQ).\n\n* Morning economic numbers had ADP reporting payrolls dropping to 123k in Dec, slightly below consensus of 130k. PMI was at 54.8 while consensus was 55.3, while factory order was up 1.0% MoM. Thankfully, none of these number fucking matters as the Dow, SPY, and IWM proceed to sky rocket with the market looking forward to stronger spending and stimulus from a Dem controlled govt.\n\n* Beyond weed, clean tech, and infrastructure - financial sector killed it today in particular mid-cap banks such as ZION (up 11.24%), CNC (up 9.81%), and KEY (up 9.73%). You'll find a similar story for large-cap bank stock with JPM closing up 4.70%, BAC up 6.25%, C up 5.75%, and WFC up 7.08%. It's a good thing I've already dumped my reopening [WFC leaps play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kftjzt/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/ggarcbi/) of $25c and $30c which are now fucking ITM by $3~$8 and still have a year left to go on them. Nice.\n\n* In yet another confusing about-face and showing a real Karen spunk, the NYSE is *really* delisting the three Chinese telecoms this time. The real kicker though came in at 2:25 PM ET when news broke that US officials are considering *more* Chinese stock delisting, adding Chinese big tech Alibaba, Tencent, et al. to the potential list. A sea of red soon followed to compound the sell-off as BABA crater to the Earth's core and closed down -5.32%. Following suit, PDD closed down -5.58%, JD down -7.66%, and the same goes for Chinese EV NIO at -5% and XPEV at -2.62%. LI escapes semi-unscathed and closed the day up 2.48% thanks to a new BofA coverage with a Buy rating and a PT of $42.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, GME was on track for a solid 8-9% day until the storming of the capitol occurred, PLTR's fade accelerated further while MT stays modestly flat, bouncing back from the overall market sell off. GME closed up 5.70% to $18.36, PLTR closed down -4.31% to $23.54, and MT closed up 0.32% to $24.70. ICLN, a new WSB favorite due to new balance of power in Congress might be added to future roundup if it continues to pump. Imagine that, a clean energy boomer ETF becoming a meme stock. The iShares fund managers are probably wondering why their alerts going tits up with social media mentions and sentiment brewing.\n\n* Random trade ideas (these are not financial advice and if it goes wrong that's your own gdamn fault):\n\n    1) FSLY leaps Jan 2022 90c or 100c+ for eventual TikTok climbing back fully onto the service as ByteDance pointedly makes a political jab at outgoing administration. Headwind on this retarded play: cloud/stay-at-home stock continues to take a beating as rona gets under control as vaccine roll out picks up. \n\n    2) Sell AAPL cash secured puts Jan 15 120p to 122p if the big tech fade continues rest of the week. These ~0.18 to 0.24 delta strikes are likely safe enough and if assigned, you'll have an upcoming ER on Jan 26 to sell IV pumped covered calls to get out of the trade intact. Feb 19 puts are likely okay to sell as well given you'll receive much more premium from the ~43 dte chains. Headwinds on this retarded play: its CSP and CC. As boomer as it gets. \n\n    3) BABA leaps and/or March debit call spread for another bounce in a wild trading week for BABA. March 230c/250c is probably a sufficient spread while baking in a bit of IV via ER which is on Feb 11. Jan 230c to 250c if you're not poor. Headwind on this retarded play: Jack Ma really is missing and the US govt really will delist a 600 bil market cap Chinese ADR, forcing out all major US institution holders. Yeah, right.\n\n* The DOW closed up 1.44% or 437 pts, Nasdaq down -0.61% or -78 pts, S&amp;P up 0.57% or 21 pts, and RUT closed up 3.98% (!!) or 78 pts.

This ends a 7-month streak of steady gains in recovery. No worry fam, if you've lived thru March 2020 lows you'll know that market doesn't give a fuck about employment #s until you go all-in on calls. US reports more than 4k covid deaths for the first time ever - refer to above on why market doesn't give a fuck.\n\n* Flurries of behind-the-scene political actions are happening as the country moves on from Y'all Qaeda's storming of the capitol. A number of high-level admin officials from policy advisors to cabinet members have bailed the sinking ship that is this current administration. Chatters of invoking 25th amendment. Second impeachment. POTUS has stated that he will NOT attend the upcoming inauguration (who knew he's a gdamn snowflake?), after finally putting out a statement that an orderly transition will occur. \n\n* Psuedo-SJW social media companies and platforms have banned POTUS in tandem, conveniently doing so after the Dems have clinched both chambers of Congress and will likely sit on committees regulating them. No real movements from these actions yet, though TWTR is pulling back after it banned POTUS for 12 hours until he deleted the offending Tweet. TWTR closed the day down -1.62% to $51.48, after an intraday low of more than -2%.\n\n* BA got a slap on the wrist with a 2.5 bil fine from the DOJ for killing non-Americans. About 10% of the fine goes to the US govt while about 500 mil goes to the families of the 346 people that died in the two 737 Max crash. Remaining (70%) amount goes to BA customers because let's face it, corporations are truly the ones really hurting. BA closed down -1.32% to $209.\n\n* It's a solid day for many Chinese ADRs as as BABA and TCEHY escape Treasury's list of delisting stonk. BABA closed up 4% for the day at $236 while TCEHY closed up 5.61% to $76.89. NIO, the TSLA of China (or is it XPEV? or LI? find out in 1.5 years!) closed up big at 8.55% to almost $59, despite offering to sell 68m more shares last month at $39. Surely the US market isn't going to be China Hustled.\n\n* Today's big movers: DDD and PLUG continues their wild rocket moves to the stratosphere as strong market sentiment continues. DDD closed up 2.48% to $23.54, after touching an intraday high of almost 10% earlier. PLUG closed up 13% to $53.78.\n\n* PSTH, Ackman's brainchild SPAC flew almost 12% today on ZERO news but faded towards end of the day. PSTH gang collectively jizzed and made a mess of themselves. Will it be Stripe? (it's not) Chick-fil-A? (it's not) Bloomberg? (eh they sorta denied it) Subway? (please god no). Find out eventually sometime Q1 2021 as Bill continues to edge us. Seriously Bill, announce something amazing already because I'm up more than 20k on zero news and I'm tempted to sell. PSTH closed up 7.24% to $29.32.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, a new law is being formed where none of these gdamn stock can go up together on the same day. PLTR faded to flat of 0.80% after being up more than 3% during early mornings, whereas GME and MT both fade some more today after a decent run-up attempt this entire week. GME close the day down -2.16% to $17.69, while MT pulls back from a week's worth of solid gain at -2.7% to $24.83. WSB's new meme ETF ICLN had some profit taking happened much to the displeasure of people who fomo into the ETF this morning, not realizing the sea of red candles were not bullish indicators. ICLN close the day down slightly to -0.75% to $33.15. Funny enough, OTM monthly calls haven't pulled back that much due to the magic of IV.\n\n* While initially red through out most of the day, the DOW reversed course and closed up 0.18% or 56 pts, S&amp;P up 0.55% or 20 pts, Nasdaq up a solid 1% or 134 pts, and RUT closed flat at -0.25% or -5 pts. It's the weekend and WSB newcomers addicted to FDs will no doubt flood the weekend thread, constantly asking if their $700 portfolio (funded in part by the $600 stimulus) with OTM calls will be okay.

I have no positions long or short in Tesla (not like this post fucking matters). \n\nSource:[The Reasonable Formation of Unreasonable Things](https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/Collaborative%20Fund%20Bubbles.pdf)\n\nThere is a distinct difference between volatility and things getting completely out of hand.\n\nStocks fell 19% in the summer of 2011, and quickly recovered. That‚Äôs volatility. The Nasdaq fell 80% after 2000, and didn‚Äôt recover for a decade. That‚Äôs something else.\n\nBut the fact that markets spread from volatile to utterly out of control -- like a bubble -- makes sense. Rational sense. It makes so much sense that we should expect it to keep happening.\n\nOne of the biggest flaws to come out of academic finance is the idea that assets have one rational price in a world where investors have different goals and time horizons.\n\nAsk yourself: How much should you have paid for Yahoo! stock in 1999? The answer depends on who ‚Äúyou‚Äù are.\n\nIf you have a 30-year time horizon, the smart price to pay was a sober analysis of Yahoo!‚Äôs discounted cash flows over the subsequent 30-years.\n\nIf you have a 10-year time horizon, it‚Äôs some analysis about the industry‚Äôs potential over the next decade and whether management could execute on its vision.\nIf you have a 1-year time horizon, it‚Äôs an analysis of current product sales cycles and whether we‚Äôll have a bear market.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a daytrader, the smart price to pay is ‚Äúwho the hell cares?,‚Äù because you‚Äôre just trying to squeeze a few basis points out of whatever happens between now and lunchtime, which can be accomplished at any price.\n\nWhen investors have different goals and time horizons -- and they do in every asset class -- prices that look ridiculous for one person make sense to another, because the factors worth paying attention to are totally different.\n\nPeople can look at Yahoo! stock in 1999 and say ‚ÄúThis is crazy! A zillion times reve- nue! This valuation makes no sense!‚Äù\n\nBut many investors who owned Yahoo! stock in 1999 had time horizons so short that it made sense for them to pay a ridiculous price.\n\nA daytrader could accomplish what they need whether Yahoo! was at $5 a share or $500 a share, as long as it moved in the right direction. Which it did, for years.\n\nMoney chases returns. Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term.\n\nThat process feeds on itself. As traders push up short-term returns, they attract more traders.

So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA).

Highly recommend skimming over it, but I will highlight the main points later on in the post.](https://pages.thelionelectric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investor-Presentation_20203011.pdf). \n\n\n\n**So why the fuck haven't you heard about this Lion Electric company?**\n\nSimple, it's a Canadian-based company located in Quebec. No company outside of 'Murica or China can be of interest right? **Right????** Well, the EV credits in Quebec are pretty fucking insane, but other than that you are right. The good thing is it ain't gonna be Canadian-focused much longer. Lion is going to reveal its new U.S. manufacturing facility any day now, rumoured to be in [Michigan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lion-electric-co-to-deliver-michigans-first-11-electric-school-buses-as-part-of-the-volkswagen-mitigation-settlement-300917333.html) where it delivered the state's first ever EV school buses. They are, in fact, already [registered as a business](https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc) in Michigan. Oh, and it just so *happens* that the rumoured factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence **(see more below on why this is pertinent)**. Anyhow, their future lies in the United States, and it is precisely why they are uplisting on the NYSE when the [merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005149/en/Northern-Genesis-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Filing-by-The-Lion-Electric-Company-of-a-Preliminary-Registration-Statement-on-SEC-Form-F-4-in-Connection-With-Their-Proposed-Business-Combination) with NGA closes in March, as per the CEO. Seriously, look at how many job listings across America there are already by clicking [here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs).\n\n\n\n**So then, why should you REALLY care?** \n\nBecause fucking Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care, idiot. News *silently* broke last week that **Amazon** has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 **(or up to 2500 over 5 years)**. Emphasis on silently because this company, unlike many EV rivals, lets their results do the talking rather than a dishonest PR team.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the possibility of Amazon purchasing at least **2500 trucks per year, or 1.1b worth** for the following five years after 2025, with an option to acquire up to [15.8% of the company](https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/). Worth mentioning that 2500 is an extremely CONSERVATIVE number here, as that is their current production capacity WITHOUT any US manufacturing facilities in play yet. \n\nAs for Sleepy Joe and his Green Plan, we know he plans to [electrify 500,000 school buses](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/) during his presidential mandate, with NO COMPANY better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that doesn't seem real enough to you yet, the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday, [where the Co-chair of Biden's Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance](https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG). I may as well just show you what the Lion electric buses look like, and what their clients think of them, with [this dude](https://youtu.be/StpnGrItO4E?t=46) labelling them as the **Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses**. \n\n\n\n**Why buy NOW?**\n\nJim Cramer is inviting the CEO of Lion onto **Mad money this week** (most likely Wednesday, see picture below) even though it was initially scheduled for last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this shit fucking takes off. Marc is going the pump the shit out of Lion, and Cramer is absolutely going to eat that shit up. How do I know this? He appeared on a [local, lowkey news podcast](https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE) last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, **comparing Lion to Tesla in the process**. Unfortunately he said all of this in French, which I'm sure none of you idiots understand. But once he regurgitates this shit in English on Wednesday, the significant deal with Amazon and similarities to Tesla as an infant will send this shit to the moon and beyond.  \n\n\n\n**Why pick Lion Electric over all the other trendy EV stocks?**\n\nLion is more than just prototypes, ideas, and false hopes:\n\n¬∑ There are currently 7 different trucks and buses AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE\n\n¬∑ They ALREADY have 300+ vehicles on the road with over 6mil miles between them \n\n¬∑ Multi-year deal agreement for Amazon to purchase up to 2500 vehicles (Lion6 and Lion8) 2021-2025, with even bigger and more lucrative opportunities afterwards\n\n¬∑ CN (huge Canadian transporter) recently Purchased 50 trucks - with a chance to increase size of order later\n\n¬∑ Nationalized companies in Quebec, such as Hydro Quebec and SAQ, also have purchase agreements in place and provide a strong GOVERNMENT-BACKED foundation to Lion's business\n\n¬∑ On top of already having suppliers for their batteries, Lion is building a facility to produce THEIR OWN batteries and immunize themselves against potential shortages as they upscale production, set to be completed in 2022\n\n¬∑ V2G technology ready for the batteries, all the buses will have this implanted. \n\n¬∑ Deal with ChargePoint\n\n¬∑ 8 NEW vehicles to be produced between 2021-2022 including: Ambulance, bucket truck, Class 5 and Class 7 trucks\n\n\u200bhttps://preview.redd.it/r474kkw6gh461.png?width=1556&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ac78e954597aa443fe41cbeca2a6e5f8d613cfa\n\n\nHere is the current Prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, visiting the Quebec site with enthusiasm:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/claq6khofh461.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52920dde2c8e47766f0b4252256ed3986d1d8343\n\n\n\n**What to expect in the next years?**\n\n¬∑ USA expansion completed by 2022\n\n¬∑ New production facility to be built in USA in order to increase production\n\n¬∑ Allows them to brand as ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù to help with sales + proximity to USA market\n\n\n\n**Sales and revenue projections:**\n\n¬∑ Revenue of 3.6 billion dollars by 2024\n\n¬∑ Cash flow POSITIVE in 2023\n\n¬∑ EBITDA positive by end of 2021, with growth of approx. 16% YOY afterwards\n\n¬∑ Cost reduction of 50% by 2024 (better profit margins)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tben1vegh461.png?width=1353&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96f14cd5d17c2f50515c336091d6d80feda39685\n\n\n**TLDR; EV transportation company partnered with Amazon labelled as the Tesla of school buses.

So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA). In fact, it literally has the [largest fleet of electified school buses](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/largest-zero-emission-school-bus-fleet-in-north-america-bolstered-by-10-bus-delivery-from-lion-electric-301194935.html#:~:text=The%20Lion%20Electric%20Co.&amp;amp;amp;amp;text=With%20these%20new%20buses%2C%20Twin,school%20buses%20in%20its%20fleet.) on the road in North America as we speak. \n\n#[Here is the link to their investor presentation where they are already forecasting a positive EBITDA by the end of 2021.

No company outside of \'Murica or China can be of interest right? ***RIGHT????*** Well, the EV credits in Quebec are pretty fucking insane, but other than that you are right. The good thing is that it ain\'t gonna be Canadian-based much longer. Lion is going to reveal its new U.S. manufacturing facility any day now, rumored to be in [Michigan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lion-electric-co-to-deliver-michigans-first-11-electric-school-buses-as-part-of-the-volkswagen-mitigation-settlement-300917333.html) where it delivered the state\'s first ever 100% electric school buses. Lion Electric, in fact, are already [registered as a business](https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc) in Michigan. Oh, and it just so happens that the rumored factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence (see more below on why this is pertinent). Anyhow, their future clearly lies in the United States, and they are uplisting as LEV on the NYSE when the [merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005149/en/Northern-Genesis-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Filing-by-The-Lion-Electric-Company-of-a-Preliminary-Registration-Statement-on-SEC-Form-F-4-in-Connection-With-Their-Proposed-Business-Combination) with NGA closes in March, as per the CEO. Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking [here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs).\n\n\n\n#*So, why the FUCK should I care?* \n\n\n**Because fucking Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care, idiot.** \n\n\nNews silently broke last week that **AMAZON** has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on \'silently\' because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a PR team full of slimy fuckers. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least **2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth** for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to [15.8% of the company](https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/). \n\n**Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.** \n\nAnd, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla\'s truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. **The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon\'s facilities, and most importantly they are already ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION**. So, no, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market. [See here how diversified their truck lineup really is.](https://imgur.com/nJiXzp8)\n\n#*And what about Joe Biden?* \n\n**Sleepy Joe and his Clean Energy Plan have vowed to [electrify 500,000 school buses](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/) over the next 4 years**\n\nNO COMPANY better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that seems like a stretch to you, consider this: the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday (Jan 13), [where the Co-chair of Biden\'s Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance](https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG). Allow me to show you what the Lion Electric buses look like, and what their clients think of them, highlighted by [this dude](https://youtu.be/StpnGrItO4E?t=46) from California  labelling them as the **Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses**. \n\nI‚Äôm sure many of you will be aware of the merger completed today with Proterra, another electric bus manufacturer. Awesome right? [A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not mention Lion in the peer comparison section, as they would\'ve admitted to being second best.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0) \n\n\n**Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion\'s revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra\'s entire revenue in 2025.**\n\nAnyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be shitting out school buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.\n\n\n\n#*Why should I buy RIGHT FUCKING NOW?*\n\n**Because tomorrow may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.**\n\nJim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto **Mad Money** [TOMORROW](https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg) after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this shit fucking takes off. It is still trading at a measly 1B valuation, with Amazon ALONE forecasted to purchase more than 1b worth of trucks per year come 2025. Marc is going the pump the shit out of Lion tomorrow, and Cramer is going to eat all of it up, as this company is the real deal. \n\n**How do I know $NGA will pump so hard?** The CEO of Lion featured on a [local news podcast](https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE) last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, **comparing Lion to Tesla in the process**. Unfortunately, he said all of this in French, which I\'m sure none of you idiots understand. But once he regurgitates it all in English to Jim Cramer, the significant deal with Amazon and its similarities to Tesla in its infancy will send this shit to the moon and beyond üöÄüåö. \n\n**Oh yeah, and, by the way, the last time Cramer hosted a CEO from an up and coming EV merger acquisition (CIIC), that stock went from 21$-37$ in the two following trading sessions.**\n\n\n\n#*But why should I FUCKING pick Lion Electric over all the other EV stocks that get spammed here?*\n\n\n\n**Because Lion Electric offers much more than just prototypes, ideas, and false hopes**\n\n\n\n¬∑ There are currently 7 different [trucks and buses](https://imgur.com/L1cu6oS) **available for purchase**\n\n\n¬∑ They already have **300+ vehicles on the road** today with over \n  6mil miles between them \n\n\n¬∑ Multi-year deal agreement for **Amazon** to purchase up to \n  2500 vehicles (Lion6 and Lion8) 2021-2025, with even bigger \n  and more lucrative opportunities afterwards\n\n\n¬∑ **CN (huge Canadian transporter)** recently Purchased 50 \n  trucks - with a chance to increase size of order later\n\n\n¬∑ **Government-backed**: [Canada\'s prime minister Justin \n  Trudeau supports the company](https://imgur.com/xoJ9Kze), \n  while nationalized companies like Hydro Quebec and SAQ have \n  purchase agreements in place that provide a strong foundation \n  for Lion\'s business\n\n\n¬∑ **Produce their own batteries:** on top of already having suppliers for their batteries, Lion is \n  building a facility to and immunize themselves against potential shortages as they upscale \n  production, set to be completed in 2022\n\n\n¬∑ **V2G technology** ready for the batteries, and implemented \n  into their school buses\n\n\n¬∑ Deals with **BMW, ChargePoint, Nuvve, and Romeo Power**\n\n\n¬∑ **[8 NEW vehicles](https://imgur.com/dFFTczt)** to be produced between 2021-2022 \n  including: Ambulance, bucket truck, Class 5 and Class 7 trucks\n\n¬∑ [USA expansion](https://imgur.com/wFbrle5) completed by \n  2022, will give them a **"Made in America"** image\n\n\n¬∑ NKLA *obviously* had to [scrap their deal on the table with Republic Services](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/23/tech/nikola-garbage-truck- \n  canceled/index.html) to \n  provide them with up to **5000 garbage disposal trucks** just a \n  few weeks ago.

This is a strategic cost savings plan for them that allows them to purchase a company and expense that money later. Think integration.\n\nWhy? Look into Amazon‚Äôs bus contracts in major cities. Almost nobody knows that Amazon spends \\~8 figures a year in many of the cities it operates in to bus its employees to and from its FCs at no cost to the employees. Sometimes they do it because it‚Äôs agreed to for tax exemptions, other times because they‚Äôre nice (and rich) like that. By purchasing EVs they‚Äôll get sooo many more benefits though. With equity in the company they‚Äôre buying from a % of profit flows back to them. Emissions credits to offset their FC costs, and they can expense all the bus purchases and operating coats to offset FC income, effectively enabling them to offset the purchase of the equity in LION through FC expense. Not to mention the major capital injection to an early moving EV company, once cities see these Lion busses everywhere they‚Äôll be like hey, great idea, and now because Lion is already producing at scale to support the AMZN order, their busses are competitively priced and they can break even or make money on the product while other companies are operating at a loss. They also make some real nice lookin automated garbage trucks you'll see popping up in all those big liberal cities trying to go net zero in 10 years. \n\nIt‚Äôs a brilliant deal for them when you consider everything.

That‚Äôs basically what happened in 2008, due to the political situations in several different countries in a short time period, oil production was severely disrupted and with increasing demand, this caused the spot price to soar.\n\nCoincidentally, BlackRock offered ICLN to the public for the first time in June of 2008, at the peak of the oil spike at $50/share. With the spot price of oil at insane levels, talk of ‚Äúpeak oil‚Äù in the zeitgeist, democrats talking about addressing climate change head on with a cap-and-trade bill, investors suddenly were dreaming of the post-oil future. There was a lot of interest in investing in green energy companies. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to buy shares in Chevron in 1897, right?\n\nWell, unfortunately for the retards that gobbled up whatever BlackRock was peddling, June 2008 was a bad time to go long on any security, as Lehman Brothers would file for bankruptcy in September which would create a global recession and swift fall in oil prices as demand plummets during recessions. With a barrel of oil cheaper once again cheaper than a keg of bud lite, green energy stocks plummeted.\n\n# Climate Change\n\nIn case you were eating crayons in grade school,  you see, carbon emissions are heating up the planet and it‚Äôs creating an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, wildfires, severe snowstorms, tropical storms and the like. Even if you don‚Äôt give a shit the polar bears or Australia‚Äôs tourism industry or Florida, the extreme weather events are not ideal.\n\nSo let‚Äôs solve climate change then? There is a big problem though. Actually solving climate change has this unfortunate effect of reducing the viability of companies in the O&amp;G sector, which means if passed, O&amp;G workers will lose their jobs.\n\nDoubly unfortunate for the democrats, O&amp;G workers are concentrated in a bunch of swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas etc. These states have entire cities where the local economy is entirely dependent on O&amp;G companies.\n\nYour average democratic primary voter though, does not live in one of those cities. Their general attitude can be (somewhat unfairly) boiled down to ‚Äúwe have to do this thing that‚Äôs morally important to me, and we have to make some sacrifices, and you will have to lose your job and I will keep mine, but we have to make sacrifices, or the world will LITERALLY end by 2040.‚Äù\n\n# The cap-and-trade bill of 2009\n\nThere is a quite straightforward solution to climate change: cap-and-trade. The idea is that every year government will offer permits to emit X tons of CO2 and sell these to the highest bidder. These will then be tradable assets. So it‚Äôs a market based system, where the price of the permits directly reduce the competitiveness of fossil fuels when zero-carbon energy is also available.\n\nSo in 2009, Obama admin with Senate democrats came out with this plan to fix climate change, known as the [‚ÄúCap-and-Trade Bill‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Clean_Energy_and_Security_Act).\n\nCap-and-Trade was immediately unpopular among Americans, republicans and blue dog democrats seized on the opportunity to shit on Obama for his job-killing tree-hugging agenda, with hilarious ads such as this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=20&amp;v=xIJORBRpOPM&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=20&amp;v=xIJORBRpOPM&amp;feature=youtu.be)\n\nAs you can see in the ad, Joe Manchin eventually killed the cap-and-trade bill and West Virginia‚Äôs coal industry was revived (no it wasn‚Äôt, because coal isn‚Äôt competitive with O&amp;G anymore).\n\nFrom here on out, a rift emerged amongst democrats and republicans, because the liberal democratic party primary voters DEMAND action on climate change while the electoral college and the senate punish action on climate change. So the issue these days is more polarized than abortion (actually).\n\n# Biden‚Äôs Energy plan\n\nNow, the environment &amp; healthcare were and continue to be the top issues for the democratic base, including its most active voices. Biden may have lost some of these voters in the primary, but he brought them into his coalition in the general and won the white house.\n\nBasically Biden needs to throw some ~~red meat~~ vegan burger patties at the base.\n\nNow, Green New Deal doesn‚Äôt include any mention of a carbon tax or cap-and-trade, I assume, because socialists hate market-based solutions that actually work. Instead it asks for a $100T in infrastructure spending.\n\nWith Joe Manchin still in the Senate, locked &amp; loaded ready to shoot cap-and-trade again, that‚Äôs not happening anyway.\n\nBut as it happens, this green infrastructure spending isn‚Äôt such a bad idea. Because infrastructure spending is popular across the aisle. It creates jobs, and does not directly destroy O&amp;G jobs. As we saw this year, the treasury can just sell trillions of bonds with no downside and JPOW will happily exchange them for real dollars.\n\nAnd the end goal of Democrats is to try to use that money to get a bunch of people in the Sunbelt and Texas employed in green energy, as an electoral counterweight to everyone employed in O&amp;G.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSo Biden\'s plan will not include a carbon tax or cap-and-trade bill, or at least won\'t focus on it. Instead it will involve pumping trillions into green energy infrastructure with the goal of getting Americans across the Sunbelt &amp; Texas employed in Green Energy, as an electoral counterweight to all those employed in O&amp;G. Getting people dependent on green energy in swing states is the only path forward for democrats.\n\nIn other words, Biden will order Mama Yellen to sell trillions and trillions of Treasury bonds, which JPOW will happily exchange for real dollars, which will then be used to give fat government contracts to ICLN‚Äôs holdings and beyond.\n\n# How to monetize this:\n\nICLN‚Äôs holdings are only 34% US based. Which is less than ideal because Biden\'s platform includes "Buy American" and one of their political goals is to employ as many Americans as possible in green energy, so I expect them to prioritize American companies when handing out contracts. Though of course, if Biden is pumping a million trillion into solar, I can\'t imagine South Korean solar panel producers don\'t also get some of that.\n\nACES (another clean energy ETF) is 80% US and 20% Canadian, and TAN (solar focused) is 50% US. ACES is lower volume though and has fewer strikes so it\'s up to you, I think it\'s getting slept on here.\n\nAdditionally, if you don\'t already have enough exposure to TSLA through stock, options and ARKK, QCLN is another option similar to ICLN.\n\n# Positions:\n\n50 shares each of TAN, ACES. 100 shares of ICLN\n\n5x TAN 4/16 125c\n\n5x ICLN 7/16 31c\n\n4x ACES 6/18 96c'), ('‚ÄúTSLA bubble is going to pop‚Äù', '‚ÄúTSLA bubble is going to pop‚Äù~ Giga Berlin comes online in middle/fall of this year.

We also wanted some metrics on how, if any, that could counterbalance the power of the HFT machines that exploit liquidity and volume to move markets and the role of traditional hedge funds in the digital era.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'ll spare a lot of the one-off items and deep examination that came back (both because you shouldn\'t care, plus nobody has the attention span to read 173 pages).  The summary is this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# SUMMARY HERE:\n\nSome of you realize it, many of you don\'t, but you\'re officially a major market mover, on par with or even more powerful than HFT\'s in some regards because you\'ve essentially found a way to break the system.  I\'ve seen a lot of posts take about GME\'s launch and people claiming they don\'t understand how it happened or people who have an innate sense but perhaps don\'t grasp the nuts and bolts of it, but it\'s something you should probably get used to, and something you\'ve been causing a while.\n\n# Maths:\n\nThis sub has about 1.5 million subscribers.  It\'s estimated there\'s another 300,000 or so people who read it but aren\'t subbed to it.  It\'s estimated a full 1/3 of the people who read this sub don\'t actually invest at all, so they can be removed.  But of those of you who remain (removing outliers such as myself that would skew the numbers irrationally), conservative estimates on your AUM (assets under management) is **somewhere between 5.5 and 7 \\*\\*BILLION\\*\\* dollars**.  Which would put you in the top 4% of all hedge funds if that money were all thrown in a pool (only 7% of funds have over 1bln).  Except you have an inherent advantage in that you aren\'t regulated like a hedge fund and don\'t have to follow any rules.  You can just do whatever the fuck you please because it\'s funny (GME).  And the more you do it, the more powerful you become as a collective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# (TLDR HEREHEREHERE)\n\nIt means that, when you decide to act collectively, you can effectively overpower the machines and institutional investors and move a small or mid cap  stock in a direction the rest of the market doesn\'t want to take it as a herd.  And you can do it whenever you like.  Or, in the case of a large cap stock like TSLA, even though you couldn\'t latently overpower the market, if you decided to move in the direction of momentum (as you did last year), you effectively function analogously like putting a supercharger on an engine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What should you do with this information?\n\nWell, I suppose you start by giving yourself a tuggie while thinking about it.  But then understand that you\'ve already determined 2021\'s stock of the year less than 2 weeks in by sheer force of will.  Just like TSLA was last year in spite of the numbers making absolutely zero fucking sense (there\'s no logical reason why TSLA is worth  more than every other car maker combined when they don\'t sell shit), you\'ve made GME the 2021 stock of the year that you can just keep making go up and up no matter what the numbers or fundamentals say...just because you fucking want to.  As long as you guys stay in the herd and just keep holding the line, you can essentially push that stock to whatever price you damn well please (hell, this sub probably owned 6% of the company this morning).  You guys bullrushed this so hard that, at one point today, THERE WEREN\'T EVEN SHARES AVAILABLE TO SHORT.  By brute force, you essentially made it so the stock HAD to go up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\'s an interesting phenomena.  I myself gave it a run around Christmas and bought a bunch of 1/15 options @ 19 late last year which I just exercised today, honestly expecting them to expire worthless.  Fast forward to today, and I\'m sitting on 60,000 shares of a company I don\'t even believe in after exercising those today.  But what I have come to believe is the power of you glorious retards, so I\'m riding shotgun for this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust keep that in mind when you start seeing the herd here start to move in a direction.  I read a lot of comments today about people who didn\'t hop on the train because they didn\'t believe or because they pussed out, and this was an interesting test case of you dudes being able to do whatever the fuck you want when you unify, so just put on the cap and start chanting One Of Us...'), ('ARK SPACE ETF - BEAT CATHY WOODS TO A SPACE STOCK', 'ARK SPACE ETF - BEAT CATHY WOODS TO A SPACE STOCKARK SPACE ETF - EARLY PLAY\n\nPosted this 37 days ago ~~\nReview the material below. \n\nArk is about to create a space ETF \nGet into space stocks before cathie woods does \nUp 11 percent after hours with news of this \n\nSR@C will\nMoon \nFirst space infrastructure stock. \n\nPositions \n May 21, 2021. $10 calls. \nMay 21 , 2021 $7.5 calls\nUp 50 percent already. \nThis is a 10 bagger. \n\nPeople Already talked about S R @ C \nnumerous times. \nBut let me go over it again. \n\nFirst stock in space transportation and infrastructure. \n\nEasy explanation for you boys. \n\nEveryone is sending crap into space. \nBig tendie boys purchased out an entire launch for their satellite, but what about the extra cargo space on the rocket?

(APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you\'ve been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. \n\n- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD\'s CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). \n\n- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia\'s RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they\'re up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it\'s not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. \n\n- AMD\'s next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD\'s previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer\'s like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). \n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD\'s own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: ["...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market."](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)\n\n- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).\n[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)\n\n- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn\'t really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here\'s%20why&amp;text=Apple\'s%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.)

AMD is still Apple\'s partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you\'ll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let\'s break it down by company.\n\n - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company‚Äôs Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&amp;text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft\'s laptops run on AMD hardware. \n\n - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.)

My sermon today is an examination of why some of our fellow autists have become millionaires while I continue to live in a cardboard box. \n\nI was an early-ish follower of the $GME faith, but when tribulations came my faith was shaken. I still went to church, but my heart wasn\'t in it like those we look up to. We must reflect on our failures to grow as followers in Cohen. \n\nThis testimony is long (sorry). I needed to force myself to actually examine things so I don\'t fuck up the next opportunity for tendies. This is my penance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: Retard examining why I made small gains off $GME despite being in months ago. I keep track of all my trades. $GME has been a rollercoaster of emotions and opportunities in a very short time, so lots to learn. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Takeaways\n\n1. I never truly committed or believed in the position. It remained a small % of my portfolio and I was always hedging because being down even a couple % hurt, let alone -20% swings. To find 20X return you have to invest in companies that have significant uncertainty (and volatility). That  means persuasive arguments on both sides. If you lack conviction you won\'t be able to stay in.  \n2. Follow those charts and imagine you don\'t know where we end up. Put yourself in that moment. Holy fuck. **Am I buying the dip or catching a falling knife**? This has been bumpy and uncertain. We can all pretend this was a sure thing, it wasn\'t. It still isn\'t.\n3. We\'ve all heard Fear and Greed rule the market. Its one thing to say that. Its another to feel it and observe it in yourself. My mood on $GME has flipped from "This motherfucking boomer CEO is burning all my $" to "Fat FIRE, this year, motherfuckers" 4 times in as many months. I felt intense emotions (still feeling them during the current run). W/o acclimating to balance that out I think its impossible to make good decisions. \n4. I\'m very glad I kept detailed notes on what I was doing. Write down your thoughts and reason for taking a position. Revisit these. We\'re all retards. But that doesn\'t mean we can\'t learn our bad habits and improve. I\'m stunned looking back by how often I was paralyzed and couldn\'t take action. \n5. None of this was obvious. There were strong cases that the business was undervalued. It was a good bet. But it was a bet. (Blasphemy you say? The true prophet, RoaringKitty said on yesterday\'s stream that as June turned into July and August and no PE firm or other investors stepped in he began to wonder if he was right). The business was bleeding cash, it just wasn\'t hemorrhaging like bears thought. The management is out of touch. COVID could have been worse. The broader market could have sold off, offsetting anything $GME did (and probably making sentiment even worse). \n6. I believe at $30-$40 the core business is reasonably priced and the value thesis is proved out. There are other stories (short squeeze and the business transformation) that remain. IMO these are far less certain, but in this market a good story might be worth $100. \n\n# Charts + comments\n\n[Entering via CCPs](https://preview.redd.it/kyuu2rh4rab61.png?width=2769&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ce9dc1dc310e756ff294b88061557fad2726a50)\n\nI hear about $GME. The business model of buy kids consoles for pennies on the dollar seems lucrative, video game sales in general are good, but COVID + things going digital are big question marks. The stock is up a lot from lows, but only liars buy at the low and sell at the high. Still seems reasonable, I sold weekly $10P (felt good about this).  Put premiums were good (3.6% for 3 days) and I figured I could get write for a couple weeks before being assigned. \n\nAlso, picked up some 1/15/21 $30C (retard FOMO, I even noted as much "Getting in w/o doing full research based on Burry and Ryan Cohen + extremely high short interest.

Continue to do option writing strategies (purchasing for CCs or near the money Puts).

Intense FOMO. Feeling like an idiot for not buying when things went back to \\~10. I\'m doing the exact opposite of what you\'re supposed to do. A week ago I thought $GME was shit. Now I want to back up the truck... I held off buying at $13 (It\'ll pull back), $14, $15 (c\'mon). I finally buy at 500 shares @ $16.01, 300 shares at $17.22, 700 more at $19.10. Watching this run up while holding a small position is ruining my Thanksgiving holiday...\n\nFeeling like a sucker I hedge w/ CC\'s. IV is thru the roof going into the Earnings call. I expect some detail on the MSFT deal. Hopefully the terms they got were good. Ideally they talk about similar deals w/ Sony and Nintendo (They got Reggie on the board, that\'s got to be a layup, right?). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sherman gives a terrible CC](https://preview.redd.it/o8xq3fmiwab61.png?width=2760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d93203eea9a8e1a1ed17f6087cffaa7f22e3dd9)\n\nJesus.

I was expecting the move to stop at 15-30%. Obviously misjudged that but that\'s been my experience. I also really wanted to do the smart thing for once and take profits (relax, not selling shares, just writing contracts) on the upswing vs my normal retarded MO of buying high hoping to sell higher. \n\nWas eye-balling selling the $40C when it hit 600IV ($6 premium for 3 days...), but by that point I was so gunshy (every call I\'d written to that point was blown by) and convinced this was going to infinity. I\'m resisting the urge to buy, but its hard. Instead I sold some CCP\'s at $15k worth of $25 (4% return over 3 days). Those 1/15/21 $30C, even w/ massive theta decay, are selling for 3X what I got. \n\nAs confident as the market re-affirming my beliefs makes me $GME still isn\'t turning a profit yet.

It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it\'s very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don\'t try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don\'t even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/"boomer" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won\'t be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt\'s showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don\'t know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don\'t hit margin call.\n* Take the "Calls" as very discounted, and "Potentially A Call" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow.

It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.\n* My private codes was used to develop it, and it\'s very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.\n* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.\n* Discord and telegram admins, don\'t try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don\'t even own the codes behind it.\n* There are a lot of SPY500/"boomer" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.\n* There won\'t be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.\n* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement\n* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only\n* This is a one man bot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bot Overview**:\n\nIt\'s showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Key:**\n\n* Pharma companies are very risky.\n* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.\n* Companies that you don\'t know how they work are very risky.\n* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).\n* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.\n* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don\'t hit margin call.\n* Take the "Calls" as very discounted, and "Potentially A Call" as somewhat discounted.\n* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.\n* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.\n* You don\'t have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***At Close of Thursday***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Batch 1:**\n\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tMA\tMastercard Inc\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tMKTX\tMarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tMSCI\tMsci Inc\n* BMS\tBraemar Shipping Services plc\n* CSRA\tCisadane Sawit Raya PT\n\n*Maybe*:\n\n* CRSR\tCorsair Gaming Inc\n* TWTR\tTwitter Inc\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tFLT\tFleetCor Technologies, Inc.\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tGPN\tGlobal Payments Inc\n* Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services\tJKHY\tJack Henry &amp; Associates, Inc.\n* Environmental &amp; Facilities Services\tROL\tRollins, Inc.\n* Financial Exchanges &amp; Data\tCME\tCME Group Inc\n* Health Care Equipment\tBDX\tBecton Dickinson and Co\n* Health Care Equipment\tDXCM\tDexCom, Inc.\n* Industrial Conglomerates\tROP\tRoper Technologies Inc\n* Interactive Media &amp; Services\tTWTR\tTwitter Inc\n* Internet Services &amp; Infrastructure\tVRSN\tVerisign, Inc.\n* Managed Health Care\tHUM\tHumana Inc\n* Pharmaceuticals\tPRGO\tPerrigo Company PLC\n* Restaurants\tDPZ\tDomino\'s Pizza, Inc.\n* Restaurants\tMCD\tMcdonald\'s Corp\n* Research &amp; Consulting Services\tINFO\tIHS Markit Ltd\n* TYL\tTyler Technologies, Inc.\n* DPZ\tDomino\'s Pizza, Inc.\n* DXCM\tDexCom, Inc.\n* JKHY\tJack Henry &amp; Associates, Inc.\n* GPN\tGlobal Payments Inc\n* FB\tFacebook, Inc.

Yes, it has exploded 135% in the last month alone but it isn't over. Right now, the sentiment is bearish and I agree in the short term, but long term PLUG is only going to keep growing. There are a few key points I want to highlight.\n\nPLUG is single-highhandedly the largest hydrogen-fuel-cell titan in the industry. 20 years of industry under its belt, it now services Amazon with 40,000 active forklifts and Walmart uses roughly 10,000 active vehicles. Now, they are partnering with two more titans. Renault and SK Group. The French and South Korean markets respectively. First, Renault. Renault is well established in France, and is backed by the government itself. The deal with Renault is HUGE for plug in the European market. **The two plan to establish an innovation center for development of fuel cell technology in LCV vehicles** ***for*** **future Renault platforms. Initially, heavy vans and utility. They plan on combining manufacturing with Renault, establishing a vertically integrated fuel cell stack system and a manufacturing center in France. Expansion of refueling systems to accommodate the new market. The deal will only accelerate in the future as Renault plans to adopt Plug Power technology in commercial fleets.** Why is Renault Interested? Well, the EU announced a plan calling for Europe to have at least six gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2024 (A critical period for PLUG for a few more reasons) and the production of up to 1 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. Doable, sure, but the bigger picture is this:\n\nThis is almost exactly how the rise of the solar industry happened. EU plans into the future. The European Union unveiled a plan this month to invest hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling it to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050. This is potentially **insane**.\n\n([https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen\\_strategy.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen_strategy.pdf))\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSecond group. SK Group is planning to invest 1.5 billion USD in an intention to form a joint venture next year. The goal is to provide South Korea (and later a possibility of the larger Asian Market) hydrogen fuel cell systems. Particularly, Infrastructure and electrolyzers (power stations, basically). There is, however, no information if PLUG is planning on directly partnering with any manufacturers in Korea. (I will get to this later). Why is SK Group interested in Plug? Plans call to build a liquid hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 30,000 tons in Incheon in **2023**, to be scaled up to 280,000 tons in **2025**. The South Korean government's commitment to shift the to Hydrogen with 729 Million dollars this year. A 30% increase from last year.\n\n([https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/060120-asian-countries-accelerate-hydrogen-plans-with-policies-and-projects](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/060120-asian-countries-accelerate-hydrogen-plans-with-policies-and-projects))\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Now, whats the point of all this infrastructure? I understand the powerplants but is the future just going to be us driving in Amazon forklifts?* \\- Says you, a dumbass who doesnt do DD and leaves it up to others in what is basically a Casino.\n\nSweet summer child..\n\nHydrogen fuel is going to be big in the automotive scene. Yes, Papa Musk hates it, so fucking what? keep buying one year out calls @ 50% OTM and tell Musk to fuck off with how much bank you're going to make.\n\nGM may have made a statement that they are going for ALL hydrogen back in 2017, but they have since rescinded that statement. Their Hydrogen plan still remains though, Fuel-cell power-trains will be used in military and commercial vehicles. ([https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en](https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en))\n\nHonda is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology. The Honda Clarity. They plan on expanding on the line greatly as they seem to be extremely set on becoming green.\n\nHyundai is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Hyundai Nexo. **Hyundai Motor Group and its suppliers plan to spend of 7.6 trillion won (US$6.7 billion) through 2030 to raise production of fuel cells by more than 200-fold as the South Korean automaker targets to become a key player in the new-energy vehicle technology.**\n\nSo much money is flowing into Hydrogen fuel cell technology, why is noone capitalizing on it?\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe play: Wait for volatility to die down, PLUG has had a massive run up. Truly tremendous, and I'm glad to have been in PLUG for a long while. The hype is almost certainly blown up, and general market attitude is that it is a sell which I agree with.\n\nTLDR: PLUG is going to return from low-earth orbit to refuel, my price target is 50 by mid-FEB before PLUG does a Hindenburg and the price fucking explodes. üöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPosition:\n\nWait for good entry: PLUG 70C 06/18. Yes its fucking expensive, wait for better entry and learn how to do spreads, dumbass. You bet big and win big.\n\nIf you have more than 6 brain cells or are straight up fucking broke: Buy LEAPS and Shares on the dip thats about to happen. Im in for PLUG 100C 1/20/23, and will load up even more because its as high as Robinhood's shitty platform lets me go. **SPREADS, LEARN HOW TO DO THEM, STOP BEING POOR AND LOSING YOUR TSLA GAINS ON SHITTY PLAYS.**\n\nHave fun playing.

I'm sitting here in my retard palace reflecting on how my idea of the market has changed since I dove into this sub right around the beginning of last year. I first visited WSB a couple years ago but was quickly overwhelmed with all the abbreviations and inside jokes. At the time I dismissed it as a nihilistic financial-prank hellhole where people with nothing to lose YOLO'd their money away and that it was encouraged and that everyone was just trying to throw away their money. While that does happen obviously, I think there's a much bigger macro-vision of this sub that is changing things forever in the market.\n\nIn my opinion, nothing demonstrates this macro-vision better than the narrative surrounding GME. To have a talking head that my dad would watch when I was a kid continue to reference this sub on TV and say that we're in control is insane. At the same time, this exposure could be a death sentence. We are in a precarious situation now where the volume of users here really makes us a stupidly strong retail entity if we all choose to rally behind something. It's cool, but it's also a liability. The number of braindead questions that have flooded the daily threads since the GME rally began has been immense, and that's only counting the comments that made it through whatever automatic filters the mods set up here. Because of this volume, it's going to increase our exposure to the media exponentially. There have already been tons of articles written about WSB, but none of them have gotten to the point of putting on the blame for something financially devastating. With the influence we have over the market (at least when there's an agreed upon general sentiment here) it's only a matter of time until we upset the wrong suit on Wall Street and they try to see what they can do to fuck up the operation here.\n\nI hope it doesn't come to that because I really do think the camaraderie here is something special. On first visit it seemed like a mean, uninviting place, but what I've realized is that people do look out for each other here. When someone does something 'retarded' like take every cent to their name and put it into weeklies, they get called retarded (because they are), but they'll also get comments like 'no one has ever lost money taking a profit' when it's time to go. There's a bond over degenerate lack-of-financial-responsibility, but it's all in the name of pursuing financial independence in a brute-force manner and attempting to stand up to a system that has never shown much care for those not deemed worthy to be a part of it.\n\nI know there's a flip side to all of this. There's the idea of gambling addiction, the idea that you see a lot more people post about their wins than losses, confirmation bias, and that a lot of people won't make it out the other end with a profit, but that goes for most systems in life. It still feels great to see someone here find the life they never thought they could have, buy that car, provide for that family member, etc. And maybe it doesn't last or they test their luck and lose their gains, but no one ever said we weren't retarded.\n\nPoint is...All eyes are on us, especially after all the TSLA gains last year. We will see how the GME chapter unfolds this year, but it is undeniable that the media exposure and influence this sub holds is only going to increase, and with that there's a lot to consider amongst ourselves as to what the primary tone and function of this space is. To not anticipate hordes of normies and suited wall-streeters continuing to infiltrate the space is to underestimate the growth that will take place whether we want it to or not. I believe, when we look back on it in the future, that this chapter of WSB began last year around the crash in March, but there's no denying it's a new chapter nonetheless. It's only gonna get crazier.\n\nWSB to the moon."), ('Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching Tips', 'Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching TipsThis is long, if you‚Äôre uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR\n\nA while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my gambling.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.\n\nI\'m using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.\n\n**Tools**\nI use barchart.  You can honestly get by using their free version, you just can\'t sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.\n\nThere are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.\n\n**Basic Concept**\nLong story short, you\'re ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it\'s flagged as unusual activity since it\'s a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if "they" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.\n\nMM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and shit.  However, they can\'t get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.\n\n**Hunting the Whale**\nSo I\'ve got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I\'m looking at don\'t expire past a couple weeks out (more on why earlier), then I\'m ready to eye scan.\n\nI typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonk that does NOT have earnings imminents.**  To make sure I\'m looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.\n\n**1) Clusters of orders‚ÄîABNB example**\nThe way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I\'m looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I\'m looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of call seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  \n\n**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it‚Äôs hedging against itself as it‚Äôs own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can\'t just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he\'s got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don\'t want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since it\'s a smaller volume.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger bet in their stocks, the those type of option clusters indicate the option order is the big play, and it\'s hedging itself.\n\n**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check their general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter with their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it\'s a good nerd play.\n\n**Example**: Here\'s the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.\n\n[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)\n\nSo, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all those options showing up at 12:52, that\'s our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute, with some put orders at the bottom.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge--we\'re onto something.\n\n**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don\'t like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after that one.\n\nPassed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.\n\n**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**\n\nThe same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven‚Äôt had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend‚Äîthis makes the order unusual and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it\'s probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn\'t the best example of the week because there wasn\'t a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don\'t have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)\n\n[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)\n\nA better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and a one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That‚Äôs a flag for us‚Äîsporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD Otm calls sprinkle in, ARK invests \n\n**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**\n\nSeeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)\n\nSometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.\n\n\n**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 1: Don‚Äôt get tricked by trends**\n\nAlthough we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just dick-riding lemmings who follow what\'s already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  When you see shit like this think before you get excited:\n\n[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)\n\nIt was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that\'s already like 400% IV, just...don\'t.\n\n**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM‚Äôs some breathing room**\n\n*Even if you‚Äôre confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two out, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can\'t do either of those things because you can\'t afford it just skip that play and check back for something new later, I promise better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.\n\nBreathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I\'d given them a week\'s breathing room, it would\'ve been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.\n\n**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker order that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday\'s EV run or this Friday\'s tech bounce could be next week\'s airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.\n\n**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH):**\n**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales\n**2)** If you don\'t have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping\n**3**) If you don\'t have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whales bets on is a \'sell the news\' event\n**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out\n**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs\n**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial and unusual whales--they\'re each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD\n**6**) You don\'t need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it\'s a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you\'re not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, they can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they aren\'t bagholding until it\'s in the money\n**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won\'t be able to do shit about it and you\'ll hate yourself when it\'s a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.\n**8**) Make sure the ticker you\'re chasing isn\'t just ER anticipation/bets.

I'm sitting here in my retard palace reflecting on how my idea of the market has changed since I dove into this sub right around the beginning of last year. I first visited WSB a couple years ago but was quickly overwhelmed with all the abbreviations and inside jokes. At the time I dismissed it as a nihilistic financial-prank hellhole where people with nothing to lose YOLO'd their money away and that it was encouraged and that everyone was just trying to throw away their money. While that does happen obviously, I think there's a much bigger macro-vision of this sub that is changing things forever in the market.\n\nIn my opinion, nothing demonstrates this macro-vision better than the narrative surrounding GME. To have a talking head that my dad would watch when I was a kid continue to reference this sub on TV and say that we're in control is insane. At the same time, this exposure could be a death sentence. We are in a precarious situation now where the volume of users here really makes us a stupidly strong retail entity if we all choose to rally behind something. It's cool, but it's also a liability. The number of braindead questions that have flooded the daily threads since the GME rally began has been immense, and that's only counting the comments that made it through whatever automatic filters the mods set up here. Because of this volume, it's going to increase our exposure to the media exponentially. There have already been tons of articles written about WSB, but none of them have gotten to the point of putting on the blame for something financially devastating. With the influence we have over the market (at least when there's an agreed upon general sentiment here) it's only a matter of time until we upset the wrong suit on Wall Street and they try to see what they can do to fuck up the operation here.\n\nI hope it doesn't come to that because I really do think the camaraderie here is something special. On first visit it seemed like a mean, uninviting place, but what I've realized is that people do look out for each other here. When someone does something 'retarded' like take every cent to their name and put it into weeklies, they get called retarded (because they are), but they'll also get comments like 'no one has ever lost money taking a profit' when it's time to go. There's a bond over degenerate lack-of-financial-responsibility, but it's all in the name of pursuing financial independence in a brute-force manner and attempting to stand up to a system that has never shown much care for those not deemed worthy to be a part of it.\n\nI know there's a flip side to all of this. There's the idea of gambling addiction, the idea that you see a lot more people post about their wins than losses, confirmation bias, and that a lot of people won't make it out the other end with a profit, but that goes for most systems in life. It still feels great to see someone here find the life they never thought they could have, buy that car, provide for that family member, etc. And maybe it doesn't last or they test their luck and lose their gains, but no one ever said we weren't retarded.\n\nPoint is...All eyes are on us, especially after all the TSLA gains last year. We will see how the GME chapter unfolds this year, but it is undeniable that the media exposure and influence this sub holds is only going to increase, and with that there's a lot to consider amongst ourselves as to what the primary tone and function of this space is. To not anticipate hordes of normies and suited wall-streeters continuing to infiltrate the space is to underestimate the growth that will take place whether we want it to or not. I believe, when we look back on it in the future, that this chapter of WSB began last year around the crash in March, but there's no denying it's a new chapter nonetheless. It's only gonna get crazier.\n\nWSB to the moon."), ('Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching Tips', 'Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching TipsThis is long, if you‚Äôre uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR\n\nA while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my gambling.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.\n\nI\'m using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.\n\n**Tools**\nI use barchart.  You can honestly get by using their free version, you just can\'t sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.\n\nThere are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.\n\n**Basic Concept**\nLong story short, you\'re ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it\'s flagged as unusual activity since it\'s a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if "they" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.\n\nMM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and shit.  However, they can\'t get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.\n\n**Hunting the Whale**\nSo I\'ve got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I\'m looking at don\'t expire past a couple weeks out (more on why earlier), then I\'m ready to eye scan.\n\nI typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonk that does NOT have earnings imminents.**  To make sure I\'m looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.\n\n**1) Clusters of orders‚ÄîABNB example**\nThe way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I\'m looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I\'m looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of call seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  \n\n**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it‚Äôs hedging against itself as it‚Äôs own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can\'t just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he\'s got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don\'t want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since it\'s a smaller volume.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger bet in their stocks, the those type of option clusters indicate the option order is the big play, and it\'s hedging itself.\n\n**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check their general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter with their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it\'s a good nerd play.\n\n**Example**: Here\'s the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.\n\n[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)\n\nSo, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all those options showing up at 12:52, that\'s our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute, with some put orders at the bottom.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge--we\'re onto something.\n\n**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don\'t like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after that one.\n\nPassed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.\n\n**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**\n\nThe same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven‚Äôt had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend‚Äîthis makes the order unusual and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it\'s probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn\'t the best example of the week because there wasn\'t a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don\'t have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)\n\n[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)\n\nA better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and a one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That‚Äôs a flag for us‚Äîsporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD Otm calls sprinkle in, ARK invests \n\n**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**\n\nSeeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)\n\nSometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.\n\n\n**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 1: Don‚Äôt get tricked by trends**\n\nAlthough we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just dick-riding lemmings who follow what\'s already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  When you see shit like this think before you get excited:\n\n[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)\n\nIt was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that\'s already like 400% IV, just...don\'t.\n\n**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM‚Äôs some breathing room**\n\n*Even if you‚Äôre confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two out, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can\'t do either of those things because you can\'t afford it just skip that play and check back for something new later, I promise better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.\n\nBreathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I\'d given them a week\'s breathing room, it would\'ve been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.\n\n**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker order that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday\'s EV run or this Friday\'s tech bounce could be next week\'s airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.\n\n**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH):**\n**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales\n**2)** If you don\'t have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping\n**3**) If you don\'t have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whales bets on is a \'sell the news\' event\n**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out\n**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs\n**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial and unusual whales--they\'re each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD\n**6**) You don\'t need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it\'s a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you\'re not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, they can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they aren\'t bagholding until it\'s in the money\n**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won\'t be able to do shit about it and you\'ll hate yourself when it\'s a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.\n**8**) Make sure the ticker you\'re chasing isn\'t just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.\n**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don\'t baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.\n**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it\'s time to.  If it\'s good enough to screenshot, it\'s good enough to close the position.\n\n**Positions**:\nDumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me, but saw some ineresting 2/5s I held including\n\nWKHSc\nPLTRc\nSPYc (1/19, 1/22)\nLMNDp\n\nAnd a couple tickers that I couldn‚Äôt post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps\n\n***\n\nTLDR\nUse a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.

Big tech such as FB and GOOGL closed up 3.9% and 3.3%, while MSFT closed up almost 1.8%. Conversely, select sectors were punished today as a rotation of sort occurred. Retail/consumer storefront took a beating with WMT down -0.86%, COST down -2.12%, TGT down -3.41%, DG down -2.54%, and BBY down -2.11%.\n\n* It\'s another spectacular pump day for WSB cult gang as a new religion is formed where GME is the deliverance and the Moon (or Mars?) is the promised land. GME opened at a strong 15%+ and went as high as 25%+ intraday to $45.52 but a tweet by Andrew "tool bag" Left of Citron at 6:58 derailed the party and send shares under $37 before the bull run continued. Shares of GME closed $39.36 as shorts continue to be squeezed, though the momentum has clearly be snapped a bit.\n\n* Over at BB land, shares of BlackBerry Ltd. pumped another 25% as the market continues to shift the company\'s valuation as the Canadian company chugs on with their focus on enterprise security software/service. BB closed up 25.51% to $12.35. \n\n* NFLX reported stellar numbers as sub count tops 200 mil. New net sub numbered in 8.5 mil, an uptick of 2.2 mil from the previous quarter and beats previous projection of 6 mil by 2.5 mil. NFLX sees Q1 additions of 6 mil. While Q4 EPS was $1.19 vs $1.39, NFLX sees Q1 EPS of $2.97 vs consensus of $2.10, further propelling the stock. Implied move was about 8% for weeklies so for those who YOLO\'ed you\'re gucci as long as you didn\'t buy some retardedly OTM strike. NFLX is up 12.5% as of writing in AH to $564. DIS is up 2% AH and ROKU is up about 1.6%.\n\n* GM pumped more than 9% today on news of MSFT 2 bil investment in GM\'s self-driving startup Cruise, valuing the side hustle at 30 bil. The boomer stock has low-key been killing it in the past few years and as Model 3 replaces the entry-level 3 series and C class in various neighborhoods, you\'ll likely see GM EVs replacing various Hondas and Toyotas in the coming years as well. GM closed up 9.75% to $54.84.\n\n* Bank/financial earnings continues with BAC and GS reporting this morning. Both reported strong quarters tho the run-up may have been a bit too much as both underlyings faced the same sell-off pressure their sector faced last Thursday. BAC authorized a 2.9 bil repurchase plan, shares closed the day down slightly -0.73% to $32.77 while GS closed -2.26% to $294.\n\n* Incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urges Biden to act big to further help the rona punished economy, but also made some notes on raising corporate rates eventually (once the US overcomes rona). With Yellen set to replace Mnunchin, those who enjoyed Mnunchin\'s various stimulus phone tag with Pelosi will no doubt miss the "stimulus talks are going well" pumps.\n\n* Shares of home builders reacted favorably to Biden\'s $15,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit proposal, though it will likely face an uphill battle in Congress given the various scope and size of the overall stimulus package. LEN is up 2%, DHI up 2.8%, PHM up 3%, NVR up 3.74%, and KBH up 5.5%.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land not named GME and BB, ICLN closed up 2.75% as the cleantech pump resumes, while MT took a beating of -4% to closed at $22.96, despite a slight PT raise of .5 Euro by Morgan Stanley. Surely metal gang won\'t be another tanker gang situation.\n\n* The DOW closed up 0.38% or 116 pts, Nasdaq up a strong 1.53% or 198 pts, SPX up 0.81% or 30 pts, and RUT is up 1.32% or almost 28 pts.\n\n* Notable ERs and numbers later this week: UAL, DFS after market close on Wednesday and INTC on Thursday after market close.

What it means in this context is the amount of stock someone short the options would need to buy or sell to hedge their position as price moves.\n\nFor WSB popular stocks, I believe that about 2/3 - 3/4 of all options were sold by dealers to you degenerates, which means that the dealer is now "short gamma", which is not a superhero movie involving dwarves.\n\nThat means that as prices move, dealers have to madly buy or sell stocks in the direction of the price movement so as not to lose money, because option dealers/market makers ALWAYS win (almost). This means that in some situations, moving over a "gamma ramp" (price where there\'s a lot of gamma) may be many times easier than in areas without a lot of gamma. This in turn makes a "gamma squeeze" where dealers are forced to buy or sell stock so as to not lose money (similar to short squeeze, which is when shorts are forced to buy, causing yet more buying, so as to not lose more money).\n\nIn most cases, gamma is not a meaningful effect on a stock, close to zero. But it can be a big deal. In BB\'s case, I think as much as 2/3 of the stock bought on Monday was dealers, and the weak rally today is evidence of that - no gamma ramp. GME is similar - passed a huge gamma ramp to get to the 30s last week (with dealers doing 2/3 of the buying), now kind of in between several gamma ramps, with dead zones 36-38 and 31-34.\n\nLooking at gamma can help you guys understand what price actions are possible. It\'s a giant lever that can go against you or for you. If price is slightly above a gamma ramp, it\'s bearish because small amounts of selling can crash the price quickly. If the price is slightly below a gamma ramp, it\'s bullish, because small buying can cause the price to run up the ramp, while your downside is insulated by little forced selling by the dealers.\n\nNote that when you buy NEW options from dealers, they just do the trade you do initially - buy a put, they sell stock. Buy a call, they buy stock. But from there, price moves cause them to match the stock price movement - they remove some of their short when price goes up and they sold you a put, and they enlarge their long when the price goes up and they sold you a call. Make sense? Thought not, work on your reading comprehension guys if you are trading complex derivatives with your life savings.\n\nKeep in mind that in a lot of cases, there\'s no meaningful gamma, and no price action will occur.\n\nI prepared today gamma outlooks on some of the most mentioned stocks - GME, BB, PLTR, ICLN,TSLA TLRY, NIO. Note that this tool ([http://www.tradingvolatility.net/](http://www.tradingvolatility.net/)) assumes that calls are long gamma for dealers, and puts are short gamma. I think when you guys engage a stock, it\'s more like 3/4 of all gamma is short gamma, put or call.  Thetagang shows up and gives them some long gamma.\n\nCurrent popular stock gamma landscapes (IMGUR has been a bit wonky lately... hopefully its loading):\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln](https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln)\n\nGamma is only relevant relative to float. Big gamma matters more on small stocks. You will form your own opinions and trade accordingly, and if this sub lately is any indication, you\'ll read ALL information as UBER BULLISH for the stock you YOLOed on. But here are my interpretations coldly reading the data:\n\n**GME** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\nRelevance: Very high - Big swings could cause MM\'s to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares easily.\n\nReading: Bearish with bearish trend, but possibility of strong bull case on good bid. There is a LOT of gamma ramp, and looking at the picture, we are more \'on top\' of the gamma than "on bottom" of the gamma. It turns out that the bears favor the "on top" position w/ regards to gamma. People have added a lot of bearish bets in the past few days in the form of puts under this price, which are fuel for the fire down, and can be seen in the graph as put positions. A lot more gamma ramp on net below than above. Bulls should be secure if this stock can get to the low 40s and stay there. If it starts moving down, it will run fast and then slow down at 36/37, then slow down again at 31/32/33.  Good news is that because of all this new put vol, the price action will be less naturally down in the base case as dealers dump their hedges as time goes forward, pushing price up gradually.\n\n**BB** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\nRelevance: High. Big swings could cause MMs to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares.\n\nReading: Bearish, with bullish trend. This was arguably bearish yesterday because we were at the top of a ramp. Since then, peopl ehave establsihed a lot of new positions beginning to form a bullish ramp. Bad news can send this back to 10 quickly, but not much lower quickly. Accumulation of new calls should start to make moving up a possibility though if people keep buying.\n\n**PLTR** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\nRelevance: Moderate. Float is theoretically a billion shares, and swings could make MMs buy/sell perhaps 1/4 to 1/5 of that.\n\nReading: Slightly bullish. There\'s a sharp ramp down, but also up.. and  a strong buying trend will move this up, and there\'s large block of gamma at $30.\n\n**ICLN:** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\nRelevance: Low. Why? Because this is an ETF that can be made/destroyed by issuer on demand.\n\nReading: Actually a little bullish. This is so much gamma ahead of price that it will cause a couple hundred million dollars of clean energy buying on a decent day. I know, weird?\n\n**TSLA:** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\nAs usual a gamma monster, hard to read. 750m float shares.\n\nRelevance: Lowish. Not that much gamma compared to float.\n\nReading: Bullish. Most of the gamma is above current price.\n\n**TLRY:** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\nHuge OI on this one. 136m shares avail. Nearby gamma is something like 50m.\n\nRelevance: High to very high. Maybe 1/3 or shares could turnover in some situations.\n\nReading: A bit bullish. Kind of in the middle of it all. Stock could move up fast on good buying pressure and get to low 20s on gamma.\n\n**NIO:** **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\nRelevance:  Moderate to "almost moderate". It\'s something like 20% of float near price in hedging obligations in aggressive cases.\n\nReading: Bullish. Gamma mostly above current price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My relevant positions:**\n\nNo positions on most of these.\n\nShort GME on puts.\n\nLong term holder of TSLA shares **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\nLong BBBY on calls, but didn\'t do the gamma chart of it here.

Additionally, when you take in that PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade, and that the notebook market share is growing by 50%, the demand for AMD has never been higher. \n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/20/amd-is-hammering-intel-in-this-critical-area/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/20/amd-is-hammering-intel-in-this-critical-area/)\n\n"Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann expects AMD\'s CPU market share to jump to 50%\xa0in 2021.

Don\'t listen to the "bot" fud that started after the run began, Nüí∞KüöÄA is our next way out', '$NOK ain\'t done yet. Don\'t listen to the "bot" fud that started after the run began, Nüí∞KüöÄA is our next way out**DO NOT LISTEN TO PEOPLE SAYING NOK HYPE ARE BOTS. THESE ARE FUDDERS TRYING TO GET IN CHEAPER OR EXIT POSITIONS. THE HYPE IS REAL**\n\nNokia is now a market leader in networking and enterprise level technology, essentially providing infrastructure for all types of networks. They also manufacture telecommunications equipment and engage in licensing. The most exciting opportunity in their current business model is 5G, which could be the main catalyst for this seemingly boring stock to finally break through resistance and become a valuable asset in portfolios. I\'ll give some key updates and price targets below.\xa0\n\n\nPartnerships and beneficiary of 5G rollouts\n\n\nFor starters, it\'s been a common thesis that 5G will be the greatest investing opportunity of the decade, yet Nokia remains in a flat/downward pattern on the chart. They\'ve recently earned several contracts that will give them a stronger moat in the 5G domain as well as steady revenues and growth opportunities. Recent contracts come from a very diverse group of partners, including:\xa0\n\n-A 5 year deal with T-Mobile, in which T-Mobile will power it\'s 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum using Nokia\'s AirScale Radio platform. In addition, Nokia will facilitate T-Mobile to upgrade it\'s mid-band LTE network to a 5G network.\xa0\n\n-Secured a government contract via the\xa0National Cybersecurity Center for Excellence. Nokia was selected as the tech provider and collaborator for the 5G Cybersecurity Project. The federal agency plans to utilize Nokia\'s technology for the transition to 5G from 4G. The project intends to identify 5G use cases to highlight the efficacy of the components of 5G architecture against security threats as part of a government initiative to beef up it\'s cyber security and anti-spying tools.\n\n-Partnership with Google Cloud\xa0in which the 2 firms will work in unison on businesses\' digital transformation at the network edge through both 5G connectivity and cloud-native applications and capabilities. The partnership\'s purpose is to develop solutions for communication service providers to modernize network infrastructure and ensure smooth transitions to cloud-native 5G-core. This will likely build an ecosystem of services that deployable anywhere, from network edge, to public clouds, private clouds, and carrier networks.\xa0\n\n-Nokia has also recently announced\xa0partnerships with M1\xa0for 5G solutions in Singarpore, as well as\xa0TeleZ\xa0to deploy key infrastructure solutions for TeleZ subsribers in Sweden, Lativa, Lithuania, and Estonia. They were also awarded a contract by NASA for $14.1 million to build 4G infrastructure on the moon.\xa0\n\n\nNokia has more than 220 large enterprise customers across industries worldwide, of which at least 30 have deployed 5G. They were also in a geopolitical battle in which the U.S. expressed interest in owning a piece of the company, and in response Finland built it\'s stake in Nokia via Solidium Oy, the state\'s equity-asset manager, to 1 billion euros($1.2b usd). Nokia also intends to repurchase 500 million shares in the coming months, so demand for the stock is picking up on all levels.\xa0\n\n\nIn addition to infrastructure, licensing is a huge part of Nokia\'s business model that will benefit from 5G. The "Nokia Technologies" Arm handles patent licensing, technology licensing, and brand licensing. This includes an industry-leading patent portfolio including ~20,000 patent families including ~3500 5G standard essential patent families.\xa0\n\n\nSo why is a company with so many valuable assets and recently announced deals/partnerships still trading flat and so seemingly undervalued? The short answer is the former CEO made several bad choices which gave Nokia\'s competitors an upper hand on the current 5G landscape and put NOK share price in a long term downtrend which has gave it a reputation as a boring stock with an ugly chart. However, with new CEO Pekka Lundmark\'s expertise in driving returns to shareholders, as well as the scrutiny and subsequent bans of Huawei opening the door for competition, Nokia now has a much needed breath of life and a chance to gain market share to become the biggest beneficiary of the 5G revolution. The new CEO is determined to get Nokia to the top and pull in solid returns to shareholders, as evidenced by the slew of recent contracts/partnerships along with his plans for spending aggressively on R&amp;D, as well as developing a leaner business model by cutting unnecessary expenses and unprofitable endeavors.\xa0\n\n\nNokia is primed for growth as they plan into several emerging, high growth markets including 5G, IoT, Edge computing, Network Encryption, Cloud Radio Access, Software Defined Infrastructure(SDI), Cloud Managed LAN, Optical Communications and Networking, as well as established high growth markets such as Smart Wearables, Defense/Security, and LTE.\xa0\n\n\n\nDespite the slew of positive news surrounding Nokia and their partnerships/contracts, the stock is still very undervalued, even at today\'s price surge. \n\nThat may soon change, as the stock\'s chart is beginning to signal incoming volatility. The implied volatility(IV) and volume for NOK call options are indicating big moves in the coming months. Open interest is on the rise as well.\xa0\n\n\n\n\nNOK is trading at a\xa0Price/Book ratio\xa0of\xa01.3x, compared to it\'s peers average of\xa04.0x\xa0and the sector average\xa02.2x\xa0\n\nNOK is also undervalued in terms of\xa0Price/LTM sales. It has a ratio of\xa00.9x, it\'s peers trade at an average of\xa03.9x, and the sector average of\xa01.8x\n\nTo establish the Fair Value Estimate, we\'ll use 2 models taking input from previous NOK financials, as well as data from competitors. (Competitors include: CSCO, ERIC, MSI, MSFT, and AAPL.\n\nP/E Multiples:\xa0$14.94\xa0target\xa0\n\nEarnings Power Value:\xa0$15.64\xa0target\xa0\n\nThe average for the 2 models imply a\xa0Fair Value Estimate\xa0of\xa0$15.29 \n\n\n\n\nThese estimates are based on historical data, therefore are fair values for the current price and past performance, not taking into account the market share and recurring revenue recently secured. I believe over the 3 months ad beyond the fair value will be much higher as earnings begin to reflect the value and growth from 5G contracts and recurring revenues.\xa0\n\n\nEven currently, those estimates are a bit low as Nokia\'s closest competitor, Ericsson, has a market cap that is nearly 70% higher than Nokia, despite the two having very similar financials and even trailing Nokia in several key metrics.\xa0\n\n\n\nAt NOK\'s current share price of, it remains undervalued as ERIC is only ahead of NOK in 2 key categories, EBITDA and Profit Margin, and ERIC is only outperforming NOK by a slim margin in these categories. I believe NOK should be valued much higher, than ERIC since they are gaining contracts MUCH faster than ERIC and also Huawei, which would imply a share price of\xa0$7.11\xa0before any buybacks place shares into the treasury, which would increase the price even further.\xa0\n\n\nNokias Fair value is over $25\n\nThis is based on competitor ERIC who is valued 68.4% higher despite having trailing NOK in almost every key metric for valuation, and the valuation of Huawei who is losing tons of revenue and contracts in favor of Nokia'), ('To my $BB and $AMC brethren, this is our chance to take back what they have taken from us.

Last night I read a tweet from the one and only Chamath Palihapitiya in which he states that there was some interest in investing in a small disruptive Fund where 100 autists would be selected to trade 100k each. At first, I really liked the raw idea, but then I started thinking about what makes r/wsb a disruptive force in the financial world. I came to the conclusion that wsb has always been successful because of our numbers. We crowdsource our research through DD posts and release it to the masses. What makes us a force to be reckoned with is the fact that all 2.6 million members have instant access to this research that historically has been blocked by ridiculous paywalls and obscured by complex lingo to deter the average person. After thinking back on this I felt that giving 100k to 100 individuals would not accurately represent the reason we are successful. I do believe these 100 people would certainly be successful, however, our growing community will fail to be represented. Surprisingly, under all of the memes and names, this community is one of the biggest supporters of groundbreaking tech. We collectively agree not to value companies like TESLA based on boomer fundamentals, instead, we create value through how a company or CEO can change the world. Think about it, without all of us, TSLA would be unable to break through the ceiling of old school hedge funds shorts. Giving 100 individuals money to trade would not accurately transfer our power and influence to a legitimate fund and therefore be unable to disrupt the financial sector in a meaningful way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thesis**\n\nIn my opinion, the only way we can forge our path into the future is through organizing and crowdsourcing our wealth of knowledge into a fund and allow all long-term wsb users (think one year of activity) vote on how invested money should be allocated based on  DD posts. The DD posts that would be voted on would be selected directly off of wsb by a small group of selected, popular, individuals (i.e u/DeepFuckingValue). We would be seen by most as a young group of investors changing the way the average person invests. It should go without saying that all of our trades would be posted along with the DD to support the trade by the startup. This gives the average autist an organized place to view and learn about high-level trades that are deemed reputable by intelligent site regulars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHonestly, this idea was just a brainstorming project for me. I'm only a college student, so even though I think I know everything, the reality is, I don't. I'm not sure if this idea will be feasible or if it's even legal according to SEC regulations. If it is against SEC law I would love to hear ways we could transform the idea to comply. My main goal is to have this foster future discussion on the future of wsb and finance. As a history buff, I know that democracy is the product of human innovation and I see a democratic hedge fund as the natural progression of the financial world.\n\n**Note From OP**\n\nMight end up being a dogshit idea, if you think it is, roast me in the comments, please.

Melvin was supposed to go BK at GME 175. They claimed they exited their short. What happened?\n2. If you go here [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\\_tab\\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link) 3rd page Melvin has had 54k put positions on GME since 2015. Who wrote those?\n3. How did GME get naked shorted when only Market Makers are allowed to naked short?\n\nI suspect that Melvin did go BK today. They got acquired by Citadel. They bought those put options from Citadel and Citadel has held the naked short position all these years. Risk management at these market maker desks will absolutely pull a bid and not offer if they think they are at risk of blowing up the firm. IMO Citadel market maker desk didn't trade shit the first 15 minutes of the day because they were trying to figure out what the fuck to do. I don't know if they made a last minute deal this morning or pulled capital together or what but they are on their fucking last leg.\n\nLook at Melvins long positions, a lot of them fucking sold off heavy early today. PINS. PYPL. JD. NFLX. IMO options were not traded by Citadel during first 15 minutes today while they sold off what they needed from Melvin to maintain liquidity.\n\nI made this post a few weeks ago about why market indices are at a risk this week and last week if we see any red. Gamma is basically almost negative.

You YOLO on some 550c expiring Friday if you see volume in them.

So since Short Hedge Funds need shares to unwind, the two places they can go are the stock market and Dark Pools.\n\nNow if you don\'t know what Dark Pools are, you might want to pause and rethink sinking your entire life savings into meme stocks. Dark Pools are private exchanges set up for Funds to move massive amounts of stock invisibly and without causing volatility. A Fund Long $GME simply offers up a block of stock and Short Funds can bid on it. I suppose you can think of it as a private auction house for Billionaires.\n\nInterestingly, because of all the attention **Reddit Retail** currently has, it\'s actually possible that Funds currently Long $GME will NOT be willing to bail out the Shorts via Dark Pools, because one anonymous whistleblower could cause a massive PR headache for the Long Fund.

Tiny reinforcement from Asia and a story of how unfair things have been for me and others.", 'I might make 150USD a month but I\'m holding GME!! Tiny reinforcement from Asia and a story of how unfair things have been for me and others.This is gonna be a long story about all the unfairness I observed and endured from the 1% both in corporate and the market. I\'m sorry if it bores you, I saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during 2008 and I wanted to share my own.\n\n\nSorry for my bad English.\n\n\nHello WSB, I last post around half a year ago on how the US Stock Market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of 150USD a month.\n\nI got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which I immensely appreciated. Now that the GME phenomenon has spreaded over the globe, even here (although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like I went through, more below)\n\n\nSo to recap, I saved up 2000 USD ever since I was young uptil now (I\'m 21 now), working ever since I was in elementary school, money was all I had in mind ever since our country got hit with the 2008 depression and my family was struggling.\n\n\nBackstory:\n\n\nI\'ve always loved PC and paid close attention to it so when their new Ryzen series leaks start getting out in 2016 and I got to test them out while working part time, I took a look at their stock. It was trading at around 2 I think.\n\n\nSo with my excitement I was eager to join the market, I asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was "The market is rigged, don\'t join it". I was stumbed. He lost a lot in 2008, maybe that was why.\n\n\nSo after a month of research, it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the US market, or actually to any market aside our own. Our banks wouldn\'t even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable. But here\'s the thing, the hedge funds here can. That was the first unfair thing I witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life.\n\n\nIn the end, I couldn\'t find a way to get in and watched as AMD make it meteoric rise over the past few years. It was really depressing thinking back on how the profit could\'ve helped my family.\n\n\nFast forward to 2020, I finally found a way to make a foreign account with TD and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account, I just need to send him money through epayment. The fees was high, not to mention since we can\'t use ACH because we\'re transferring to TD from his account, it cost me somewhere a total of around 50 USD for the money to land in my account.\n\n\nBut after all that I managed to get into the market, I grinded through all the courses on TD and read all the posts from various subs. But life is never that smooth.\n\n\nAround that time, I saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition. That inspired me, I wanted to do that so badly, first for my brother.\n\n\n\nThe Beer Virus Crash:\n\n\nI joined the market at Feb 28th 2020. Yes, right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses. I almost lost it all, I switched between puts and calls as I see fit but in the end, I came out with 200USD left. I thought I was the unluckiest guy on earth. It was tiring, since we\'re on opposite end of the timezone, I usually finish school or work then trare until around 2 or 4am. All that and ending up with huge loss was devastating. Thinking back, I should\'ve pulled out when I was seeing my money losing everyday.\n\n\nThe corona started affecting our country, we did a great job at handling it but I can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs. I put myself back together and get back in with my 200, slowly grinding up back to 2000. It was arduous but when I finally got back to breakeven, it felt amazing. Because I\'m not starting again, I\'m starting again with experience.\n\n\nSadly, by this time, my father lost his job due to corporate politics/dirty-play. I won\'t get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others, it\'s been going on for years. In the end, he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to "keep the image of the company". And guess what, he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews. We both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one, they would he put off. To them, it\'s much better to scapegoat one person than to say "We let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything".\n\n\nAfter all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try. It was going well. We don\'t have advance options and we also don\'t allow "legal" shorting here. But as we\'ll soon find out, it\'s only a rule for us commoners..\n\n\nBasically, shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short. I\'ve witness quite a few short ladder attack. \n\n\nAnd since we don\'t have options, we don\'t have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but I am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them\n\n\nYou can tell by this point I have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits.\n\n\nGME and the global movement:\n\n\nAnd that brings us to this unprecedented time. I didn\'t get into GME soon enough (4 GME shares at 150 cost basis) my money was tired up in Spreade for BB and Nok expiring last Friday which was rather deep ITM (I had BB 21/22C and BB hit a peak of 28 last week). And as we all know, by abusing their power yet again, they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless. But I held GME, I held through their attacks when it tankee to 100 because you guys were holding with me.\n\n\nSo now all I have is 4 GME shares that I will hold until we can get back at them and WHEN, not if, we win, hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market - that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this.\n\n\nA lot of people I know are asking to join and I\'ve been helping them setting up accounts on TDA or eToro. Etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck. Since there are no way for us to get Fractional Shares (eToro been wonky), some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of GME on Monday.\n\n\nI look forward to the day we win this, so many things are on the line, not just for our generation, but our previous and future generations, not just for the US stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world. In the end, we might win the battle of GME but still not win much from this war of unfairness but that\'s a start.\n\n\nSo to conclude this stupid long TEDtalk.

For those aspects we're not certain of, let's assume the *worst case* for gme retail. This is a helpful way to think through risks generally so why not apply it here? Let's go.\n\n**Assuming Worst Case for Retail**\n\n\n*All shorts are new shorts*\n\n* Did Melvin and Shitron cover? Let's assume they weren't lying when they say they closed their short positions.\n* But let's take that idea further and assume ALL existing shorts are NEW shorts. Remember, we're talking worst case.\n* Shorts entered when the price was at recent highs so the pressure on them is not as extreme as previously thought. \n* Borrow costs would have been high but hedgies would have planned for that. \n* This means new shorts who bought high are intending to hold until retail eventually folds. They're prepared for a longer game.\n\n*Gamma squeeze sqouze*\n\n* There was no major benefit to closing above 320 Friday. We could argue about naked calls but we're assuming worst case here.\n* The gamma squeeze already occurred earlier in the week when the price jumped over 320 forcing MMs to delta hedge open call contracts by purchasing additional shares. \n* This DID cause a price spike earlier in the week (remember we touched 500 at one point?). That was the gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood threw cold water on the party.\n* I misunderstood gamma squeeze's and posted some incorrect info in my earlier comments. Ouch. Sorry!. I've gone back and edited those. For great info on why the gamma squeeze already sqouze check out /u/BlueEstee's [post](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/).\n\n*Whales are big for a reason*\n\n* I am suspicious of anyone who suddenly calls me a friend after my portfolio jumps in value. Aren't you?\n* So let's assume that the whales who were hoovering up shares from the hedgies' ladder attacks are NOT retail's friend.\n* Check out /u/jkn_k's [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) in /r/investing  (I know, I know) which goes into great detail about how whales bought dips but those dips were still way above analysts' evaluations of gme, i.e. they still paid a LOT like in the 100-200s I'd guess.\n* So we can assume whales share a near-term interest with retail - both want the share price to go up.\n* But after that? Who knows? I'm sure whales won't want to hold any bags (remember they got big by feeding on smaller fish).\n\n**What If? Worst possible future for retail**\n\nHere's how this could play out poorly for retail:\n\n* Retail mania drives the stock price up higher but not *too* high.\n* Whales unload their shares to retail at higher prices and exit.\n* Brokers either further restrict trading or some other obstacle prevents retail from driving the share price higher.\n* Shorts hold and out wait retail. Retail loses interest or a black swan event occurs. There is no MOASS.\n* The share price falls and retail take massive losses.\n* Game over. :(\n\n\n**What If? Gamma Squeeze Triggers MOASS**\n\n* Going to the moon takes rocket fuel and that's where the gamma squeeze comes into play.\n* Massive upwards momentum early in the week should trigger another gamma squeeze. \n* A gamma squeeze may force the shorts to have to cover and lead to the MOASS. \n* Remember a gamma squeeze occurs when the price goes up quickly forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge open call contracts.\n* This occurred last week when we passed 320 which was the highest available strike.\n* The highest available strike this coming week? I see a 800 strike in TastyTrade. Do we have to hit 800? No idea.

He got assigned 86,300 shares of SPY and had no clue until he checked his phone the following day.\n\nThe next morning, by sheer dumb luck, SPY opened above the strike price where he had been assigned the shares.

Although the ship was mid-flight, something halted it at $49-$50. I was scared shitless. I thought that it was done for now. The increasing amount of stress I had, thinking about the stock price day in and day out (especially on weekends), began eating away at my mind. It was at that time that ***I had suddenly began to jack off about 3 times a day*** (it used to only be once a day).

I know firsthand how the media manipulates the masses. If it\'s not damn clear by now, we\'re being manipulated in a textbook fashion so that we sell our positions in "the stocks we like". Why? Maybe because Melvin still has short positions. They\'re a bunch of smart, manipulative bastards. **Except, the bigs f\\*d up their media manipulation strategy (or couldn\'t execute properly due to the overall pandemonium), and I foresee even greater losses for them. Here\'s why:**\n\n**1) Don\'t Think of Elephants**\n\nQuoting JGL\'s character in *Inception*, what happens when someone tells you to not think of elephants? You think of elephants. \n\nRobinhood essentially outlined which stocks we need to buy by telling us not to buy them. Also, they actually made each of the "do-not-buy a lot" stocks more valuable by lowering the supply without lowering the consumer demand.\n\nActually, how they SHOULD\'VE played this was by temporarily adding fees to those specific stocks. This strategy worked for California groceries. Once groceries started charging for plastic bags, people brought their own from home, which stopped excessive use of environmentally hazardous single-use plastic bags. You might think I opened pandora\'s box on a really good idea. Not really. It\'s too late. If Robinhood does add fees back, we will migrate to Fidelity, Ameritrade or E\\*Trade, if not now, then later. Robinhood\'s fee structure and profitability is not our problem. They already tarnished their brand. It\'s too late to add fees now, because it will be "on top of" all the bs they did last week. They needed to choose the "less bad" decision and picked the worse one. \n\n**2) Fear, Uncertainty, Destruction (FUD)**\n\nSo, in tandem with the brokerages, CNBC and other mainstream news outlets tried to lower the demand on GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc. by spreading fear that "retail investors will be in for some real pain". Do we believe what they\'re saying? Nope. Why waste precious airtime for the entire day, discouraging retail investors from buying more of the underlying? Because Melvin and other Hf\'s still have open short positions. Thursday\'s GME low was $112. If they couldn\'t buy to close then, they surely didn\'t do that on Friday. \n\n**3) Opportunities**\n\na. **Black Friday of the Century**  \nHold your stonks. Hold your leaps. There\'s gonna be an immense, pent-up demand and a surge in prices for each of the stocks outlined in Robinhood. They gave us a cheat sheet for what stocks to buy and hold for the immense price hike to come. If you already bought GME and the others, this is like owning a PS5 before everyone got them. Hold, because the prices are gonna be insane. \n\nb. **Retail Arbitrage of the Century**  \nIf you didn\'t already, open up new accounts on E\\*trade or Ameritrade, Buy those "do not buy a lot of" stocks you can\'t get on Robinhood. It will be the price arbitrage of the century once Robinhood is forced to lift restrictions on those stocks. Not gonna say more.\n\nTL;DR - There\'s obvious manipulation by the brokerages and media. Melvin is not in the clear. We must buy and hold, and take advantage of the immense demand surge that\'ll happen due to the brokerage\'s desperate, last minute reactive measure.

Then they‚Äôll profit billions from their shorts and buy back long positions at a discount later. Also, they‚Äôll hope $GME and their other short positions will go down in the process to recoup even more of their losses.\n\nThe Beef:\nSuits are fucked on $GME. They came at us with everything and failed. And now, every move of theirs on $GME is currently being scrutinized by the public and SEC. So they need to explore other options.\n\nThey have no other choice but to liquidate their long positions to cover their short positions.... and they‚Äôre going to use this to their advantage. THEIR NEXT BIG PLAY: They‚Äôre going short the market to make back their billions. I believe the suits are going to purposely tank the market through a massive, coordinated sell-off. They‚Äôre going to sell all of their long positions to cover their shorts at a future date, and then they‚Äôre going to promote fear on wall street and to the rest of the world. You‚Äôre going to see increased media campaigns about ‚Äúmarket volatility, uncertainty, sell off‚Äù on all the major news stations and newswires, promoted by the funds. They‚Äôre going to push an entire bearish narrative and create worldwide negative sentiment. They‚Äôre also going to have massive shorts on the market while they do this to put them in a position to make back billions. Once the market is down, they‚Äôll then buy back securities, change their narrative to bullish, and drive the markets up, riding their positions to the top. They control the ‚Äúmarket media‚Äù as we‚Äôve already seen. We‚Äôve also seen how they‚Äôve been able to control the narrative on $GME. And with all of this going on, they‚Äôre going to also hope $GME goes down with the market, as well as their other positions, so they can profit even more.\n\nThis sell-off will be a perpetuating cycle, a self fulfilling prophecy. When the big funds sell, other fund wills have no other choice but to sell too in order to save their profits. The narrative will spread and spread. I know this sounds convoluted and complex, but we‚Äôve seen what these funds are capable of. And I can‚Äôt think of any other scenario where these hedge funds come out positive for the year.

This most likely had to with liquidity and all the same issues we are seeing now\n* The VW squeeze dropped the SPY 37% in about 6 weeks\n* There was then a 26% rebound during the **peak** of the short squeeze - This tells me the people that were screwed in this one were consolidating liquidity and once they had an idea of what was going on moved into buying calls prior to shorting the market and exacerbating the housing collapse.\n* The entire market was still trending down after this rebound until the lowest of lows of the housing market crash\n\nHere is what piqued my interest.  The VW squeeze dropped the SPY **37%** from beginning to end, and the entire housing crisis dropped SPY **28%**?  **HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE?**\n\n[I eat chalk, not crayons, they taste better.](https://preview.redd.it/4gzqdeml6re61.png?width=1478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf799e7b86ec26b0b6afcefdf241cb1b48131306)\n\nSo I take this info and now look at the current SPY chart and see what GME is doing to the overall market.

He has a show on CNBC every weekday morning. He is well educated, level-headed, and very well informed. He also has contacts to every single large market player in the world.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDear David,\n\nOn Thursday morning there was a level of market manipulation that occurred on an unprecedented scale. Many people are blaming the brokers for refusing to take buy side orders on a large number of securities. The brokers have pointed the finger at the clearing house firms for increasing the collateral required for a trade from 1-3% to 100%. The clearinghouse firms are saying it was the DTCC (Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation) that raised collateral requirements. The DTCC has not said anything publicly; however, they have leaked it was their lenders who raised rates suddenly on them forcing these changes. The banks in question are the money center banks such as J.P. Morgan.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Counter party risk in the system**\n\nThe banks did this because of counter party risk in the system. In layman\'s terms, they did not believe the hedge funds had the capital to pay the bill as prices rose rapidly. David this is your time to shine. Bring on the banks, DTCC, and others involved to explain this to everyone. Wall Street is at risk of turning two entire generations against them because of the actions last week. Every millennial believes the market is rigged against them now, and rightfully so might I add.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Loss of capital**\n\nThe big story that is not getting attention in all of this is the options market. Retail investors had bought so many options in these underlying securities that firms were being forced to buy as they went higher and higher. This is a gamma squeeze, and it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In many of the securities that were not Gamestop, the options bought by retail investors expired worthless or worth a fraction of what they would have been worth. The focus is all on Gamestop, but there were many other forces at work here. Had these stocks kept going up there would have been options worth 100-500x what they were bought for. This had potential to be a far bigger story than just Gamestop going to a high valuation.\nThis has to be brought into the light and thoroughly investigated. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Yelling fire in a crowded theater**\n\nThere are many who don\'t think this was that manipulated. Let me pose this question to you. What if the S&amp;P 500 was up 5% for the week, and you walk in on Thursday morning only to be told you can only sell the $SPY, and **NOT**buy it. How far do you think we would go down that day? I believe unequivocally we would hit limit down in the first 10 minutes. The panic and fear many retail investors would have as they suddenly were afraid they were going to lose their money would cause many sells. This is what happened on Thursday to a large number of securities.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Final Notes**\n\nI have seen many on your network be very dismissive on this whole Gamestop "movement". Guests were angry, dismissive, and frankly rude to these dumb millennial traders putting money in Gamestop. This has to change if you want the next generation to join the market like yours has, and the one before them.'), ('$GME: The biggest stalemate of the 21 Century...', "$GME: The biggest stalemate of the 21 Century...^(This is an opinion based post. Treat it as an entertainment post and not as a factual post. It's all alleged. I'm not a financial advisor and don't take anything in the post as financial advice.)\n\n(Repost due to mistakes)\n\nBy  now as most of us know, Melvin cap has lost 53% on its investments and  that's only what we know(What's hidden to the public is way worse). You  might wonder, why the fuck didn't they exit their position yet? before I  answer the question, I want you to put into perspective the following.  Let's say that $GME was shorted around an average price of 40$(which is a  best case scenario for them) with 140%(if we combine all the players)  and on Friday $GME closed with the price of 325$! Which is an increment  of +700%(of the ideal short position of 40$). It means that as of Friday  they have lost their initial short position 7 times over! Them and  every other big player. So what? They most probably went to a margin  call and that's why they got the bailout money from Citadel. But why  won't they cover you might ask? Why prolong the pain and hold longer??\n\nWell,  Imagine that you had the **Infinity Gauntlet of Wall street** with Billions  of Dollars, political power, and all the media in your palms, but with  all of that you got fucked over 7 times by a collective group of apes  who banded together with accounts averaging around 2000$! Keeping that  in mind, do you think that they will ever fold? Due to them knowing that  we are retards, they think that the $GME play is a house of cards and  with the right play the house will eventually collapse to presqueeze  levels. They will never accept a -700%+ loss and will try every play in  their Ivy league book on us. They used every possible trick in the book  from using the corrupt media, to ddosing Reddit and stocktwits, until  they finally were so desperate and used their Ace of Spades(Robin  Hood)(which took years in the making) in order to exit this shit hole.  Initially, it worked but when it started to fail, they went to full  market manipulation mode(stock restrictions). Freezing Buying didn't  fully work on $GME so they went and fucked every other stock they could.  They won on the side tables by fucking $AMD, $NOK, $BB, $AAL, etc...  and that reloaded their ammunition which is scary for me.\n\nNow  moving forward, I don't think they will ever cover because they will  never accept a loss from an uneducated blue collar class in their eyes.  IMO, they think that they will be able to bend us over after all, but  they still don't understand that we don't have anything to lose. More  over, a lot of the people started with nothing and are willing to go  back to nothing if it means that they got a chance to fight and  potentially defeat the big guy on the battlefield. My biggest fear in  all of this is that even if we win, they will make a liquidity crisis as  their penultimate play. Then the government will have to interfere and  again bailout the big guy, because of course, when the small guy wins  for once, there is a liquidity crisis and his win isn't a win anymore  because small guys never win... But the real win, imo, is the small guy  while being poor, underprivileged, uneducated, and using primitive  weapons(metaphorically), being able to defeat a superpower(hedge funds)  in the battlefield(stock market)."), ('GME share price moving forward after the shorts squozed', 'GME share price moving forward after the shorts squozedHi all, im providing my opinion on the subject matter as i have been hearing chatter about share prices crashing back to $4 or $20 once the squoze is over.\n\nI am of the opinion this will not happen as we need to look at companies which successfully battled Shorters as reference- best one is Tesla TSLA:\n\na.

The manipulative actions of brokers to limit share buying by retail - share buy limit 1 - 5 shares and increasing margin to 100%, these are actually good for holders. Why you ask? Because that means retail buyers who have 100% cash to back their holdings can hold onto these shares without worry about having stop losses or increase margin requirements.\n\nSo with these 3 points once share price rocket and settled (assuming at $1000 to 1200), there will be some selling to recognise profits. But the price will not crater because simple reason, at that price GME has the capital to reinvent their biz - means more incentive for whales and institutions to hold as a value stock. Retail will mostly likely hold.\n\nWhen selling takes place it will also be controlled, because people are not selling to get out of a sinking ship, but to make a profit. Look at TSLA do you see its price cratering because holders are dumping desperately?

We all individually decided that these HF\'s took on infinite risk vs reward and that its problematic and scary.\n\nWe have encouraged each other to hold our positions so that HF\'s lose money and stop taking on trades that can cause serious economic turmoil.\n\nSo here\'s the skinny: No one is margin calling these guys, and they aren\'t dying from the interest yet. They are holding.\n\nBut what if their capital left?\nThe questions needed to be answered are\n\n1.) "what HF\'s are actively short GME, AMC, ETC. "\n\n2.) Who do they manage funds for ( is it 100% millionaire entrepreneurs or is it teachers pensions, police pension funds and the like).\n\n3.) Do THEIR investors understand that these HF\'s risked taking their investments to zero and actually bringing the HF into the negative?\n\n4.) Can retail {legally} , an independent collective concerned for above mentioned pensions have a (or many) reputable securities lawyer reach out to Hf\'s clients and be sure they are aware of the immenent risks?\n\nI\'m going to guess that most people aren\'t aware that their investment fund is risking 100% of their money going out the window. Probably think its all in goog, aapl, and fb. \n\nIt\'s not retail investors fault that they took on infinite risk and things didn\'t go their way. But retail may be able to burn the shorts and not the pensions managed by them all at the same time.\n\nPoke holes in my theory, brain is smooth like a bowling ball, small computations only.\n\nEdit: to those calling me a bot, or saying im doing HF\'s bidding. This isn\'t a sob story narrative, no one should feel bad about pensions as collateral damage except the Hf\'s who took on infinite risk. The only interest in who\'s assets under management they have is to tell them their investment with HF might blow up and maybe they take their capital out, choking HF\'s solvency out. \n\nTldr: could wsb retain a securities lawyer (s) to help HF investors / e.g. pension managers understand the true risks of their GME, AMC etc short positions.

But those **bearish positions probably aren‚Äôt big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds**.\n\nThat‚Äôs the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market‚Äôs capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**\n\nWhether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week‚Äôs selling -- the worst in the S&amp;P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they‚Äôre unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.\n\n ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don‚Äôt have an outsize influence**,‚Äù said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. ‚Äú**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.‚Äù\n\nBurned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.\n\nWhile the **S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**. To JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.‚Äôs strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a ‚Äúshort-lived technical tumble.‚Äù With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.\n\n To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020‚Äôs pandemic market.\n\n‚ÄúAlthough the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,‚Äù Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop‚Äôs ticker. ‚ÄúWhile we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.‚Äù\n\nBy Barclays‚Äôs tally, **short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves**. The heavily shorted companies -- those with interest making up more than 20% of their share float -- saw $40 billion of their stock sold short, or 5% of the total pool of bearish bets.\n\n‚ÄúWe remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,‚Äù Deshpande said. ‚Äú**The bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term, the risk of a full-fledged contagion remains low**.‚Äù"), ('Serious question without the memes please: What are all the possible outcomes to all of this?', 'Serious question without the memes please: What are all the possible outcomes to all of this?I could care less about Melvin, Citron or Citadel and they can all eat shit.\n\nMy question is for the rest of the investors, the vast majority of folks who just buy mutual funds, ETFs and Indices? This is not a sanctimonious question or a "Will someone think about the boomers" question.  What is the actual market short term and long term outcomes for folks not participating in this? As there are hedge funds getting ravaged behind the barn, there are plenty of other funds that are making a shit ton of money, buying in with their discretionary in the last few days.  There are two guys in WSB that I know who work for Canada based funds that are laughing. Ex-colleagues in fact. Yes, it\'s an uprising but it\'ll also be other already very rich people getting richer.\n\nI\'m an active trader myself and will post positions at the end.  Retired 45 years old, former derivatives trader with enough in my account.  I went 1/3 cash on Thursday and will go 1/3 cash on Monday.  The rest will ride this out.  Accounts spread across 4 brokers. I honestly have no idea what\'s going to happen.  I can confirm with better than random certainty that in addition to GME, A LOT of other tickers are in the same position.  Teachers pension funds in Canada have fully liquidated some of their gains to free up cash.

If you have EXTRA money and are already hodling GME, or cannot afford GME you should join the BLNK train.**\n\nSo let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it\'s not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn\'t even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it\'s own for it\'s own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.\n\n* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn\'t even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it\'s still got relatively small market cap though we aren\'t in the millions anymore.\n* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**\'s current 20b dollar market cap it\'s share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you\'re obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.\n\nIs this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.\n\nOkay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.\n\n**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**\n\n* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.\n* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.\n* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it\'s own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that\'s something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you\'re nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note: **PLTR** LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)\n\n**BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams**\n\n* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.\n* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.\n* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**\'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.\n* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.\n* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.\n* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.\n*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be ‚Äúeconomically priced‚Äù. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.\n* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it\'s superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don\'t care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the "well I can just charge over night" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.\n* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.\n\n**Some Other Points to Consider**\n\n* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it\'s faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that\'s what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD\'s, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. \n* **BLNK**\'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**\'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it\'s network, because as I\'ve said it does sell equipment as well.\n* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.\n* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn\'t to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.\n* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.\n* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking &amp; Services, Commercial &amp; Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food &amp; Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.\n* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.\n* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother\'s boyfriend on top of car companies we\'ve never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.\n* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.\n\n**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**\n\n* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don\'t really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV\'s are really going to be the future. I do.\n* **BLNK**\'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don\'t go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn\'t mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don\'t get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.\n* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.\n* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don\'t buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you\'re also a little bitch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what\'s not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it\'s no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it\'s "valuation." Also with what we\'ve seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. \n\nSo **BLNK**\'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That\'s about 23%. As of right now it\'s still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can\'t see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**\'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I\'d estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.\n\nMonths back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it\'s share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you\'d like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? \n\nDid I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here\'s a quote from the shitman himself back in November:\n\nShitron said, "**BLNK**‚Äôs valuation makes no sense" and called the company a ‚Äútotal scheme.‚Äù Left said it is ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù to call **BLNK** an EV stock.\n\n‚ÄúNew most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&amp;D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,‚Äù Shitron tweeted.\n\nThis goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It\'s not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.\n\n**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**\n\nCurrent market cap: **1.85b** Don\'t need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.\n\n**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. \n\nLast quarter GAAP EPS: -.12\n\nOperating Income: -3.50 M\n\nProfit margin: -285.81% \n\nReturn on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. \n\nYes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.\n\nAs a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams "***SHORT ME!***" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nCan we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It\'s almost like that hasn\'t been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**\'s 16b dollar market cap and they don\'t even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we\'re printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.\n\nLastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We\'ve seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.\n\nRemember I\'m just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I\'ll let my positions speak for themselves:\n\n**GME** 500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)\n\n**GME** shares\n\n**PLTR** 30c May 2021\n\n**BB** 14c Jan 2023\n\n**BLNK** 14c Jan 2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: **BLNK** is the only vertically integrated EV charging company, **BLNK** has international presence, **BLNK** shares are up 2400% in the past year.

At the same time **blaming us for the crash to get public support for more government regulations against us!**\n\nI'm a pretty smart ape and that's what I would do.\n\nNotice how GME has been going against SPY lately?

However, I came to the realization that **diamond hands may not be enough**.\n\nLet's review where we're at, but let's do something to make it a bit more interesting. For those aspects we're not certain of, let's assume the *worst case* for gme retail. This is a helpful way to think through risks generally so why not apply it here? Let's go.\n\n**Assuming Worst Case for Retail**\n\n\n*All shorts are new shorts*\n\n* Did Melvin and Shitron cover? Let's assume they weren't lying when they say they closed their short positions.\n* But let's take that idea further and assume ALL existing shorts are NEW shorts. Remember, we're talking worst case.\n* Shorts entered when the price was at recent highs so the pressure on them is not as extreme as previously thought. \n* Borrow costs would have been high but hedgies would have planned for that. \n* This means new shorts who bought high are intending to hold until retail eventually folds. They're prepared for a longer game.\n\n*Gamma squeeze sqouze*\n\n* There was no major benefit to closing above 320 Friday. We could argue about naked calls but we're assuming worst case here.\n* The gamma squeeze already occurred earlier in the week when the price jumped over 320 forcing MMs to delta hedge open call contracts by purchasing additional shares. \n* This DID cause a price spike earlier in the week (remember we touched 500 at one point?). That was the gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood threw cold water on the party.\n* I misunderstood gamma squeeze's and posted some incorrect info in my earlier comments. Ouch. Sorry!. I've gone back and edited those. For great info on why the gamma squeeze already sqouze check out /u/BlueEstee's [post](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/).\n\n*Whales are big for a reason*\n\n* I am suspicious of anyone who suddenly calls me a friend after my portfolio jumps in value. Aren't you?\n* So let's assume that the whales who were hoovering up shares from the hedgies' ladder attacks are NOT retail's friend.\n* Check out /u/jkn_k's [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) in /r/investing  (I know, I know) which goes into great detail about how whales bought dips but those dips were still way above analysts' evaluations of gme, i.e. they still paid a LOT like in the 100-200s I'd guess.\n* So we can assume whales share a near-term interest with retail - both want the share price to go up.\n* But after that? Who knows? I'm sure whales won't want to hold any bags (remember they got big by feeding on smaller fish).\n\n**What If? Worst possible future for retail**\n\nHere's how this could play out poorly for retail:\n\n* Retail mania drives the stock price up higher but not *too* high.\n* Whales unload their shares to retail at higher prices and exit.\n* Brokers either further restrict trading or some other obstacle prevents retail from driving the share price higher.\n* Shorts hold and out wait retail. Retail loses interest or a black swan event occurs. There is no MOASS.\n* The share price falls and retail take massive losses.\n* Game over. :(\n\n\n**What If? Gamma Squeeze Triggers MOASS**\n\n* Going to the moon takes rocket fuel and that's where the gamma squeeze comes into play.\n* Massive upwards momentum early in the week should trigger another gamma squeeze. \n* A gamma squeeze may force the shorts to have to cover and lead to the MOASS. \n* Remember a gamma squeeze occurs when the price goes up quickly forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge open call contracts.\n* This occurred last week when we passed 320 which was the highest available strike.\n* The highest available strike this coming week? I see a 800 strike in TastyTrade. Do we have to hit 800? No idea.

Happy with his quick cash, OP called it a day and didn't look at his phone again that night. In after-hours trading, the price of SPY dipped below the higher strike in the Put spread, allowing his counterparty to exercise their right to sell him thousands of shares of SPY at a profit. He got assigned 86,300 shares of SPY and had no clue until he checked his phone the following day.\n\nThe next morning, by sheer dumb luck, SPY opened above the strike price where he had been assigned the shares. It was dropping, but there was a small window of about 15 minutes during which his 86,300 shares, an embarssment of riches if there ever was one, could be sold for a profit. If SPY had opened lower, or if he hadn't noticed in time to sell immediately at the open, OP‚Äôs absurd level of leverage would have wiped him out and put him into serious debt. If those shares had been held through the end of that trading day, he would have owed $700,000.\n\nWhat about the other option in the Put spread, the one he had bought to limit his exposure to SPY falling too low?

Many people are blaming the brokers for refusing to take buy side orders on a large number of securities. The brokers have pointed the finger at the clearing house firms for increasing the collateral required for a trade from 1-3% to 100%. The clearinghouse firms are saying it was the DTCC (Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation) that raised collateral requirements. The DTCC has not said anything publicly; however, they have leaked it was their lenders who raised rates suddenly on them forcing these changes. The banks in question are the money center banks such as J.P. Morgan.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Counter party risk in the system**\n\nThe banks did this because of counter party risk in the system. In layman\'s terms, they did not believe the hedge funds had the capital to pay the bill as prices rose rapidly. David this is your time to shine. Bring on the banks, DTCC, and others involved to explain this to everyone. Wall Street is at risk of turning two entire generations against them because of the actions last week. Every millennial believes the market is rigged against them now, and rightfully so might I add.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Loss of capital**\n\nThe big story that is not getting attention in all of this is the options market. Retail investors had bought so many options in these underlying securities that firms were being forced to buy as they went higher and higher. This is a gamma squeeze, and it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In many of the securities that were not Gamestop, the options bought by retail investors expired worthless or worth a fraction of what they would have been worth. The focus is all on Gamestop, but there were many other forces at work here. Had these stocks kept going up there would have been options worth 100-500x what they were bought for. This had potential to be a far bigger story than just Gamestop going to a high valuation.\nThis has to be brought into the light and thoroughly investigated. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Yelling fire in a crowded theater**\n\nThere are many who don\'t think this was that manipulated. Let me pose this question to you. What if the S&amp;P 500 was up 5% for the week, and you walk in on Thursday morning only to be told you can only sell the $SPY, and **NOT**buy it. How far do you think we would go down that day? I believe unequivocally we would hit limit down in the first 10 minutes. The panic and fear many retail investors would have as they suddenly were afraid they were going to lose their money would cause many sells. This is what happened on Thursday to a large number of securities.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Final Notes**\n\nI have seen many on your network be very dismissive on this whole Gamestop "movement".

Who do they manage funds for ( is it 100% millionaire entrepreneurs or is it teachers pensions, police pension funds and the like).\n\n3.) Do THEIR investors understand that these HF\'s risked taking their investments to zero and actually bringing the HF into the negative?\n\n4.) Can retail {legally} , an independent collective concerned for above mentioned pensions have a (or many) reputable securities lawyer reach out to Hf\'s clients and be sure they are aware of the immenent risks?\n\nI\'m going to guess that most people aren\'t aware that their investment fund is risking 100% of their money going out the window. Probably think its all in goog, aapl, and fb. \n\nIt\'s not retail investors fault that they took on infinite risk and things didn\'t go their way. But retail may be able to burn the shorts and not the pensions managed by them all at the same time.\n\nPoke holes in my theory, brain is smooth like a bowling ball, small computations only.\n\nEdit: to those calling me a bot, or saying im doing HF\'s bidding. This isn\'t a sob story narrative, no one should feel bad about pensions as collateral damage except the Hf\'s who took on infinite risk. The only interest in who\'s assets under management they have is to tell them their investment with HF might blow up and maybe they take their capital out, choking HF\'s solvency out. \n\nTldr: could wsb retain a securities lawyer (s) to help HF investors / e.g. pension managers understand the true risks of their GME, AMC etc short positions.

By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market‚Äôs capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**\n\nWhether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week‚Äôs selling -- the worst in the S&amp;P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they‚Äôre unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.\n\n ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don‚Äôt have an outsize influence**,‚Äù said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. ‚Äú**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.‚Äù\n\nBurned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.\n\nWhile the **S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**.

In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020‚Äôs pandemic market.\n\n‚ÄúAlthough the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,‚Äù Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop‚Äôs ticker. ‚ÄúWhile we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.‚Äù\n\nBy Barclays‚Äôs tally, **short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves**. The heavily shorted companies -- those with interest making up more than 20% of their share float -- saw $40 billion of their stock sold short, or 5% of the total pool of bearish bets.\n\n‚ÄúWe remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,‚Äù Deshpande said. ‚Äú**The bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term, the risk of a full-fledged contagion remains low**.‚Äù"), ('Serious question without the memes please: What are all the possible outcomes to all of this?', 'Serious question without the memes please: What are all the possible outcomes to all of this?I could care less about Melvin, Citron or Citadel and they can all eat shit.\n\nMy question is for the rest of the investors, the vast majority of folks who just buy mutual funds, ETFs and Indices?

However, I came to the realization that **diamond hands may not be enough**.\n\nLet's review where we're at, but let's do something to make it a bit more interesting. For those aspects we're not certain of, let's assume the *worst case* for gme retail. This is a helpful way to think through risks generally so why not apply it here? Let's go.\n\n**Assuming Worst Case for Retail**\n\n\n*All shorts are new shorts*\n\n* Did Melvin and Shitron cover? Let's assume they weren't lying when they say they closed their short positions.\n* But let's take that idea further and assume ALL existing shorts are NEW shorts. Remember, we're talking worst case.\n* Shorts entered when the price was at recent highs so the pressure on them is not as extreme as previously thought. \n* Borrow costs would have been high but hedgies would have planned for that. \n* This means new shorts who bought high are intending to hold until retail eventually folds. They're prepared for a longer game.\n\n*Gamma squeeze sqouze*\n\n* There was no major benefit to closing above 320 Friday. We could argue about naked calls but we're assuming worst case here.\n* The gamma squeeze already occurred earlier in the week when the price jumped over 320 forcing MMs to delta hedge open call contracts by purchasing additional shares. \n* This DID cause a price spike earlier in the week (remember we touched 500 at one point?). That was the gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood threw cold water on the party.\n* I misunderstood gamma squeeze's and posted some incorrect info in my earlier comments. Ouch. Sorry!. I've gone back and edited those. For great info on why the gamma squeeze already sqouze check out /u/BlueEstee's [post](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/).\n\n*Whales are big for a reason*\n\n* I am suspicious of anyone who suddenly calls me a friend after my portfolio jumps in value. Aren't you?\n* So let's assume that the whales who were hoovering up shares from the hedgies' ladder attacks are NOT retail's friend.\n* Check out /u/jkn_k's [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) in /r/investing  (I know, I know) which goes into great detail about how whales bought dips but those dips were still way above analysts' evaluations of gme, i.e. they still paid a LOT like in the 100-200s I'd guess.\n* So we can assume whales share a near-term interest with retail - both want the share price to go up.\n* But after that? Who knows? I'm sure whales won't want to hold any bags (remember they got big by feeding on smaller fish).\n\n**What If? Worst possible future for retail**\n\nHere's how this could play out poorly for retail:\n\n* Retail mania drives the stock price up higher but not *too* high.\n* Whales unload their shares to retail at higher prices and exit.\n* Brokers either further restrict trading or some other obstacle prevents retail from driving the share price higher.\n* Shorts hold and out wait retail. Retail loses interest or a black swan event occurs. There is no MOASS.\n* The share price falls and retail take massive losses.\n* Game over. :(\n\n\n**What If? Gamma Squeeze Triggers MOASS**\n\n* Going to the moon takes rocket fuel and that's where the gamma squeeze comes into play.\n* Massive upwards momentum early in the week should trigger another gamma squeeze. \n* A gamma squeeze may force the shorts to have to cover and lead to the MOASS. \n* Remember a gamma squeeze occurs when the price goes up quickly forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge open call contracts.\n* This occurred last week when we passed 320 which was the highest available strike.\n* The highest available strike this coming week? I see a 800 strike in TastyTrade. Do we have to hit 800? No idea.

Although the ship was mid-flight, something halted it at $49-$50. I was scared shitless. I thought that it was done for now. The increasing amount of stress I had, thinking about the stock price day in and day out (especially on weekends), began eating away at my mind.

Once at the beginning of premarket, once at market open, and once at market closing (the intervals because of the refractory period... or... rest period, should I say).

Many people are blaming the brokers for refusing to take buy side orders on a large number of securities. The brokers have pointed the finger at the clearing house firms for increasing the collateral required for a trade from 1-3% to 100%. The clearinghouse firms are saying it was the DTCC (Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation) that raised collateral requirements.

In layman\'s terms, they did not believe the hedge funds had the capital to pay the bill as prices rose rapidly. David this is your time to shine.

Every millennial believes the market is rigged against them now, and rightfully so might I add.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Loss of capital**\n\nThe big story that is not getting attention in all of this is the options market. Retail investors had bought so many options in these underlying securities that firms were being forced to buy as they went higher and higher. This is a gamma squeeze, and it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In many of the securities that were not Gamestop, the options bought by retail investors expired worthless or worth a fraction of what they would have been worth. The focus is all on Gamestop, but there were many other forces at work here. Had these stocks kept going up there would have been options worth 100-500x what they were bought for. This had potential to be a far bigger story than just Gamestop going to a high valuation.\nThis has to be brought into the light and thoroughly investigated. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Yelling fire in a crowded theater**\n\nThere are many who don\'t think this was that manipulated. Let me pose this question to you. What if the S&amp;P 500 was up 5% for the week, and you walk in on Thursday morning only to be told you can only sell the $SPY, and **NOT**buy it. How far do you think we would go down that day? I believe unequivocally we would hit limit down in the first 10 minutes. The panic and fear many retail investors would have as they suddenly were afraid they were going to lose their money would cause many sells. This is what happened on Thursday to a large number of securities.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Final Notes**\n\nI have seen many on your network be very dismissive on this whole Gamestop "movement".

They're prepared for a longer game.\n\n*Gamma squeeze sqouze*\n\n* There was no major benefit to closing above 320 Friday. We could argue about naked calls but we're assuming worst case here.\n* The gamma squeeze already occurred earlier in the week when the price jumped over 320 forcing MMs to delta hedge open call contracts by purchasing additional shares. \n* This DID cause a price spike earlier in the week (remember we touched 500 at one point?). That was the gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood threw cold water on the party.\n* I misunderstood gamma squeeze's and posted some incorrect info in my earlier comments. Ouch. Sorry!. I've gone back and edited those. For great info on why the gamma squeeze already sqouze check out /u/BlueEstee's [post](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/).\n\n*Whales are big for a reason*\n\n* I am suspicious of anyone who suddenly calls me a friend after my portfolio jumps in value. Aren't you?\n* So let's assume that the whales who were hoovering up shares from the hedgies' ladder attacks are NOT retail's friend.\n* Check out /u/jkn_k's [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) in /r/investing  (I know, I know) which goes into great detail about how whales bought dips but those dips were still way above analysts' evaluations of gme, i.e. they still paid a LOT like in the 100-200s I'd guess.\n* So we can assume whales share a near-term interest with retail - both want the share price to go up.\n* But after that? Who knows? I'm sure whales won't want to hold any bags (remember they got big by feeding on smaller fish).\n\n**What If? Worst possible future for retail**\n\nHere's how this could play out poorly for retail:\n\n* Retail mania drives the stock price up higher but not *too* high.\n* Whales unload their shares to retail at higher prices and exit.\n* Brokers either further restrict trading or some other obstacle prevents retail from driving the share price higher.\n* Shorts hold and out wait retail. Retail loses interest or a black swan event occurs. There is no MOASS.\n* The share price falls and retail take massive losses.\n* Game over. :(\n\n\n**What If? Gamma Squeeze Triggers MOASS**\n\n* Going to the moon takes rocket fuel and that's where the gamma squeeze comes into play.\n* Massive upwards momentum early in the week should trigger another gamma squeeze. \n* A gamma squeeze may force the shorts to have to cover and lead to the MOASS. \n* Remember a gamma squeeze occurs when the price goes up quickly forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge open call contracts.\n* This occurred last week when we passed 320 which was the highest available strike.\n* The highest available strike this coming week? I see a 800 strike in TastyTrade. Do we have to hit 800? No idea. Maybe someone with more wrinkles can tell us?\n\n\nI want to give credit where credit is due here: /u/Pyr0smurf's posted some great DD on this to /r/options because it looks like they're banned atm from /wsb. Anyways - they make this [same case with charts here](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8w7z3/currently_banned_from_posting_in_wsb_but_this_is/)!\n\n\n**Why I'm Bullish on the Gamma Squeeze Next Week**\n\n* It's in the whales best interest to see the price goes up to, so retail has professional re-reinforcements\n* We have several possible Great Men of History - Cohen, Musk, Chamath - who may either buy shares or announce news that shoots things skyward leading to the gamma squeeze\n* Retail interest is INSANE. Billboards? I love you guys. That is incredible. \n* Worldwide interest? Really?! Beautiful stuff. Hats off to europoors and other brothers and sisters around the world as well - much love for holding the line.\n\n**tl;dr** \n\n**HODLing may NOT be enough to trigger the MOASS.

NIO &amp; other Stock Market News [02-01]üöÄüöÄüöÄ', 'Stock Market News for Today | Is the Short Squeeze Over? NIO &amp; other Stock Market News [02-01]üöÄüöÄüöÄ**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let‚Äôs talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let‚Äôs take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It‚Äôs really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021üöÄüöÄüöÄ, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla‚Äôs EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn‚Äôt have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favoritesüöÄüöÄüöÄ.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) üöÄüöÄüöÄ, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than ¬æ of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second‚Ä¶ this one is very hard to predict‚Ä¶ Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocksüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven‚Äôt helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.üöÄüöÄ\n\nAnd finally, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for readingüôè Hope you enjoyed the content!

NIO &amp; other Stock Market News [02-01]üöÄüöÄüöÄ', 'Stock Market News for Today | Is the Short Squeeze Over? NIO &amp; other Stock Market News [02-01]üöÄüöÄüöÄ**Stocks end their worst week since October at their lowest point on Friday. Is the Short-Squeeze Over? Over 100 companies report earnings this week. Let‚Äôs talk about this &amp; other stock market news**\n\nHello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of Friday as we saw the stock market finish with another sell-off, as the big 3 indices finished with the worst week since late October with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Vpq92y3) losing almost 2%, the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/yN3b3RQ) losing exactly 2% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/D7Cy2YQ) shedding 620 points and dropping below 30k. All 3 of them finished the week down more than 3% as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/cgz4N3r) spiked yet again on Friday, rising by almost 10% and finishing the week up more than 40%.\n\nWe saw over 70% of the companies declining [Friday](https://ibb.co/G3rX22D), as the number of companies trading above the 50-day moving average dropped under 50%, with all 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/HKhY6hC) finishing in the red again, as Energy &amp; Tech were the biggest losers. \n\nSo, let‚Äôs take a look at the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/jVFqVbH). It‚Äôs really hard to find any gaining companies, with big tech companies selling off yet again, as most of the small gainers were found in the Health Care sector. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/5Y5HR4q)  though, Microsoft was the only big tech name that managed to gain ground after smashing the earnings report, while most of the stock market faced sell-off pressures as the short squeeze mania might have pushed investors into a risk-off approach.\n\nWe also got some economic data on Friday as the December personal disposable [INCOME](https://ibb.co/Khyh7mP) increase by 0.6%, more than expected as this mostly reflected an increase in social benefits &amp; compensations, with the Q4 employment cost [INDEX](https://ibb.co/QcqbM5y) also rising by 0.7% to close out the year.\n\nMeanwhile we saw the Consumer Sentiment [INDEX](https://ibb.co/pX3mFgt) coming in at 79, slightly lower than expected, as this was also seen in the December pending home sales [NUMBER](https://ibb.co/m4tbnWN), which also came in with a 0.3% decrease month/month.\n\nThis week we have somewhat of a quiet economic [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v), with a couple of interesting numbers through the week, while [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/rxmpwVK) take center stage yet again, with interesting reports coming from companies like Amazon, Google &amp; Alibaba on Tuesday, while Wednesday we hear from PayPal, Qualcomm &amp; Spotify. We also get earnings reports from some recent favorites like Pinterest, Snap, Ford, Peloton and Penn on Thursday as the earnings season with over 100 companies from the SP500 reporting, might help push the stock market higher after the sell-off last week.\n\nIn some other stock market news, we saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/C0CSdJJ) reporting a new monthly record with 7225 vehicles delivered in the first month of 2021üöÄüöÄüöÄ, an increase of more than 350% Y/Y as the company is still ramping up production in an attempt to challenge Tesla‚Äôs EV dominance. Nio has had a huge run in the past months but has a long way to go to grow into the big valuation, though the trajectory of the company looks very promising.\n\nMeanwhile the biggest development in the markets was the trading platforms [imposing](https://ibb.co/y5sPVJv) restrictions on the squeezed stocks and even many other stocks that didn‚Äôt have such a big short % of the float with big names like AMD, Starbucks &amp; Moderna being affected. These restrictions were reduced back to only 8 companies [Sunday](https://ibb.co/GV5TKxf), but are still limited to whole share aggregate buy limits on the crowd favoritesüöÄüöÄüöÄ.\n\nThe recent moves in the stock market have made some big changes in the social world as Steve Cohen deactivate his [Twitter](https://ibb.co/0KK2P59) üöÄüöÄüöÄ, while a recent [survey](https://ibb.co/Mf6V8tz) showed that more than ¬æ of respondents are planning on leaving RBNHD while 13% already did it, with the limiting tactics being probably the biggest reason for retail investors to make this change.\n\nInteractive [Brokers](https://ibb.co/JzR5qCC) also re-opened trading on these names on Sunday, which brings to question if these platforms have insider knowledge of the future of the stocks, or did they just increased their liquidity just like [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/P6WXwDj) after they raised more than $1B earlier in the week.\n\nSo‚Ä¶ I think the stock market is still very volatile and the short squeezes can keep on going for an unknown period of time as markets can act in an unusual pattern for longer than anyone can anticipate, or the short squeeze can vanish in a second‚Ä¶ this one is very hard to predict‚Ä¶ Yes, keep the pedal to the medal in the hot stocksüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ but also stay invested in great companies as good earnings reports haven‚Äôt helped most stocks again this quarter, but may provide good buying opportunities for the long-term.üöÄüöÄ\n\nAnd finally, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wc2P16r) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way as we await to see the Manufacturing Indexes numbers in the early [morning](https://ibb.co/LvYY84v).\n\n**Thank you everyone for readingüôè Hope you enjoyed the content!

You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\nThings looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.\n\nNow, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.\n\nBut what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.\n\nMelvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.\n\nOne of two things can happen to these people:\n\n1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able\n2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.\n\nThis logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.\n\nSo what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.\n\nNow, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**\n\nIf shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?\n\nNormally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.\n\nIf they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.\n\nAnother question to consider:\n\nIf shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.\n\nThe final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.\n\nNow, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.\n\nNow, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:\n\n1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.\n2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.\n\n**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.\n\n**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question."), ('Most of the world does not yet realize how big this situation is.', 'Most of the world does not yet realize how big this situation is.First of all, the point of this post is not to tell you how high I think GME will go. This is about how this squeeze is going to affect history.\n\nAll of this short squeeze business is nothing more than a numbers game. We‚Äôve been hearing price targets from $1k to $100k, with $100k being considered outlandishly high.\n\nYes, it‚Äôs a lot of money, but this situation boils down to nothing more than a math problem. Math does not care if its a lot of money.\n\nSo lets look at some numbers. The most similar event we have ever seen in history is the VW squeeze. This was caused by hedge funds owing a short interest of **12%** and Porsche buying up **43%** of the float. VW became the most valuable company in the world, which in GME‚Äôs case would put it at $30,000 per share.\n\nAs we all know, GME was shorted 140%. And Im willing to bet that us üíéü§≤ü¶ç are currently holding well over 43% of the float, with no intention of letting go.\n\nI dont need a phd to tell you what that means for GME.\n\nSo lets say GME hits $100k, which if you look at the numbers, is a massively conservative estimate.\n\nThe hedge funds are dying at $300. At $100k they are going to have to liquidate every asset in their possession to cover their shorts. All their stocks other than GME will be sold. This means the rest of the market is going to plummet. I estimate that march 2020 will look like a joke.

Linkedin, very kindly, takes employment related info from companies and displays it for all the world including competitors of those companies and bored autists like me. So let‚Äôs see - What Can headcount trends @ $BB tell us about the company?\n\nTo start, I took a look at Job Postings / Total Headcount. If you‚Äôre a shrinking company, this should be a low number. If you‚Äôre growing, it stands to reason this % would be higher. No company deliberately hires people they don‚Äôt think they need, and last time I checked $BB‚Äôs CFO wasn‚Äôt completely retarded. Now, it‚Äôs important not to read too much into this, but as a general matter companies that are growing have high stock prices (b/c they‚Äôre growing, duh) and vice versa.\n\nFANG isn‚Äôt a perfect comp (I‚Äôll get to the others in a sec), but **serves as a good proxy of a ‚Äúbaseline growthy‚Äù tech.** No super saiyan rocketships at this point, but nobody is accusing $AAPL of shrinking.

IF YOU SAID ‚Äú$BB IS HIRING MORE RELATIVE TO ITS SIZE THAN THE AVERAGE FANG‚Äù, PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AND THROW BANANAS AT YOU, BUT YOU‚ÄôD BE RIGHT!!\n\n‚ÄúBut wait,‚Äù you say. ‚Äúgrowthinvestor123 you fucking idiot, [didn‚Äôt you just compare $BB to CRWD, ZS, SAIL, and PANW](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lamg0y/bb_dd_no_meems_part_1/) to justify a **$60 / share** price target for $BB?

Despite what the trust fund communists on this site would want you to think, firing people is never easy, and a lot harder than even hiring them. No manager wants to see his team shrunk,and no CEO wants to be painted as a chainsaw wielding asshole. $$ BB has a **history**, and that is a blessing and a curse.\n\n**Remember**, Daddy chen‚Äôs primary focus for the past almost-decade has been driving a turnaround. The handset team? Gone. Money-losing International operations? Gone. But the smart monkes and useful apes who might be able to do more than throw feces at each other???

UNTIL RECENTLY THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CUTTING, NOT GROWING, AND ONE OF THE FEW BENEFITS OF ITS PAST SHITTY HISTORY IS THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOW GROW VS.

Headcount is one thing, but of the quality of that headcount? Let‚Äôs look at two two non-retard quotes ‚Äì\n\n***"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The product starts valuing the great salesmen, because they\'re the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company." Steve Jobs***\n\n***‚ÄúIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it‚Äôs not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.‚Äù Peter Thiel***\n\nI was curious and did comparison of the ratio of $BB‚Äôs Engineering / IT monkeys to its sales.

It\'s just that the reasons for liking each of the stocks is different.\n\nFor better or worse - There was a post, I can‚Äôt find it but somebody else can, that showed the Robinhood dashboard that basically said the three most commonly held shares in any given account was, you guessed it $BB, $AMC, and $GGME.\n\nAs you know, Mark Cuban took a break from his busy calendar of being the least retarded Sharktank (No offense Daymond John, I have a soft spot for FUBU but my wife‚Äôs boyfriend no longer lets me rock it) and touching tips with Luka Doncic to [answer some questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Somebody asked why $GME was taking a nose dive off of Mt. Everest. Per Cuban -\n\n*Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*\n\n*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.*\n\nSo. Two things re: $BB‚Äôs volatility.\n\n# #1 Stopping buys (but allowing sales) tanked $BB, just like it tanked the other meme stocks. The tin foil apes can keep hawking about citadel etc. but the truth is likely that RObinhood is a tech-focused firm with shitty financial controls and even shittier risk management (GUH). Never ascribe to malice what is usually (and always with that shitshow of an excuse of a company) incompetence. Those dumbasses had a liquidity problem and solved it in the worst way possible. I hope their IPO fails and Vlad steps on a lego.\n\n# #2. The current free fall of $GME / $AMC is still dragging $BB down. Why? What happens when people get margin called? Their entire account sells off some or all of a portion to satisfy the account. For those of you more discerning retards you know that the same thing happened to the hedge funds last week.\n\n**It‚Äôs called** [**degrossing**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-30/a-reddit-army-descends-on-hedge-funds-chained-by-risk-models?sref=NJllTNWZ)**,** and is what caused the broader market to perform **inversely** to $BANG.\n\n*BTW - It was really fantastic for me to watch my MSFT calls get fucked because of the morons of this sub.

I have been a long time lurker and have never worked up the courage to post anything of my own. After missing out on the SPY PUT option bonanza that occurred back in March/ April, I vowed I would be put myself in a position to capitalize on the next big thing. Fast forward to GME and while I was a little late to the party, I did get in with everything I could, and regardless of the outcome I have enjoyed myself and have learned more in the last two weeks than during any previous stretch.\n\nMany of the comments on the daily threads center around the price of GME falling and wondering if now is the time to get out. It is common knowledge that we have been the victim of Short Ladder attacks, internal disinformation campaigns, external disinformation campaigns, market manipulation, and straight up suppression. Of specific interest to the neophytes in this community is why the low trading volume last week and especially today matter when the price starts to drop consistently and dramatically, especially during After-Hours trading. \n\nI pulled some Level II data from Robinhood detailing the AH trading volume and the corresponding price decrease. Between the hours of 4 PM EST and 5:55 PM EST, Robinhood shows a total of 475,690 shares traded. When compared to average volume and the corresponding price drop we arrive at the following:\n\n**Shares Traded: 475,690**\n\n**Average Volume: 106,230,000**\n\n**Volume Percentage: 0.448%**\n\nThe closing price at 4 PM was $222.87 and the closing price at 5:55 PM was $176.77 meaning a share price decline of $46.10\n\nDuring AH trading, GME share price fell **20.7%** on trading volume **0.448%** of the current average. THIS IS A MASSIVE ASYMMETRY and in my mind, it supports the idea that the establishment is suppressing this stock to continue scaring us all out of the market.\n\nI rewatched "The Big Short" this afternoon and it was funny to me that in that situation, no one and I mean NO ONE thought any of those guys were right. And when it turned out they were in fact correct, the banks LIED and CONCEALED the true value of the shorts UNTIL they were able to put themselves in a position to try and make money off of the problem they themselves created. Friends, it feels like we are in the same kind of endgame now and I ask that everyone remain diamond-handed and patient. The math is on our side and if it doesn\'t work out it\'s because they found a way to cheat and screw us before we knew what they were doing.'), ("Don't forget why you are here in WSB...", "Don't forget why you are here in WSB...##**...to make money.**\n\nAs one of the OG 2 mil wsb members who was here before the recent influx of new users, I've seen my fair share of gain and loss p0rn over the past couple of years, and I've been on both sides of the trade. Usually my gains or losses have been in the 5 figure range. Whenever I did lose, I have been able to grind my way out and earn it back over the following months. It was still a distant dream to think I'd finally catch a hidden diamond early and ride it to the moon (I missed out on TSLA). I simply did not have the cohones to take the yolo risks like some of you. Then came GME last Nov/Dec with rational fundamental story that had all the traits of a high conviction play that fits my trading style, and you all know the rest of the GME story that comes after that.\n\n##Have an end game. Don't trade emotionally. \n\nLately, I see a lot of people have gotten a bit personal and even political when it comes to GME on this sub. **I'm not here to tell you what your trade should be. Buy, hold, sell, sit on the sidelines and spam memes for easy internet points. Do whatever you want that makes you happy. What I am advocating for is have an exit plan that allows you to walk away without regret.** \n\nIf this means buying shares and holding forever even if it goes to zero, great. If it means taking some profit and holding a core position, great. If it means selling everything and using the profit to improve your own quality of life, great. There is no shame in choosing your own path and executing your own trading strategy.\n\nI say this because I have not slept well in the last 3 weeks, even slacking off on my day job by constantly refreshing /new of WSB. Part of it is excitement, part is FOMO on potential profits. What little sleep I did get were also dreams about GME and imagining the different scenarios play out. So yeah, I went with scenario #2 above where I cashed out a chunk of my initial position last week to lock in 560k+ profits in the $300s, and still holding 1k shares that I will take with me to Valhalla. \n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/hF93IIH\n\nNo matter what happens now, I'm walking away a millionaire courtesy of the awesome people on this sub who take the time and effort to share their DD and strategies with us. *tips hat*\n\n##What's next for GME?\n\nThere's plenty of other DD posts in the sub that will give a better analysis and theories of what might happen this week. Most immediately is that institutions have until tomorrow to deliver shares for calls that expired ITM last Friday. So hopefully there will be some upwards movement, but we have a long way to go to breakout above $400. Even still, this will likely be another gamma squeeze and not a short squeeze as HFs are willing grind their losses back rather than cover and concede a win to retail investors. **This will probably go on for weeks, but the clock is ticking for HFs. The closer we get to the earnings on March 25, the more desperate they will get. I do believe GME management will report insane revenue numbers and profit, and then detail reorg plans for the rest of the year.** This will only encourage anyone still sitting on the sidelines that GME turnaround is legitimate and we have another TSLA-like stock rise to new levels. This will force sell-side institutions to reevaluate and upgrade the stock as well, providing another tailwind for GME. \n\n*Disclaimer:* This is not professional trading advice.

At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down. The earnings were excellent, the margins were excellent, the guidance for 1Q21 was incredible, and the guidance for FY21 was almost double what the street was expecting. Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. \n\nWhat more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that?

Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!\n\nThe day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.\n\nStop losing at AMD! How? *INVEST PROPERLY*\n\nHow? Buy and hold shares or LEAPS. Stop chasing the mythical overnight gains. AMD is a *long-term success* and it has [room to double](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l6jijo/rosenblatt_securities_says_amd_could_double_in/). DO IT NOW - Price is recovering from the crush, but are still trading at a [20% discount to analyst consensus](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast), and at a 10% discount from it's recent highs.\n\nConclusion: This is a better buy-and-hold than GME, BB, or anything. AMD has grown continuously in the past 5 years and, if you read the DD on /r/AMD_stock, you'll discover that it also has an incredible growth roadmap the next 5 years.\n\nStop losing. Buy shares and double your money.\n\nPositions: 4800 AMD shares @ $27.96"), ('DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?', 'DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it\'s late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or "counterfeit" GME stock, and it\'s there\'s some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you\'re curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they\'re able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I\'ve noticed that\'s been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y\'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don\'t buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI\'m going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day\'s volume**. However, I\'m going to make an assumption that a day\'s volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it\'s using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = \'&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;\'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = \'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=\' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open(\'fail_to_delivers.txt\', \'r\') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split(\'|\');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.\'.\')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print(\'Data for Jan {}\'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res[\'status\'] == \'NOT_FOUND\':\n                print(\'No volume data for {}\'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res[\'volume\']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print(\'{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol\'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + \'M\', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere\'s some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I\'ll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.\n\nIf everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value &gt; 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.\n\n**The Results**\n\n    Data for Jan 4\n    RMO    $10M   455173

Have Fun.\n\nEDIT - Someone pointed out a mistake in my script.

You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\nThings looked bad today, and truthfully I\'m surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.\n\nBut what\'s interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.\n\nMelvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.\n\nOne of two things can happen to these people:\n\n1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able\n2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.\n\nThis logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.\n\nSo what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn\'t add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.\n\nNow, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**\n\nIf shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?\n\nNormally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven\'t covered.\n\nIf they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.\n\nAnother question to consider:\n\nIf shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.\n\nThe final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.\n\nNow, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.\n\nNow, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:\n\n1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.\n2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won\'t be immediately squeezed, it\'s interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.\n\n**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can\'t be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I\'m just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.\n\nCopied off a greaT DD\n\n**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze.

SPY hit that resistance and reversed. Didn\'t break all-time highs for quite some time. NASDAQ on the other hand, almost without a hint of resistance, blasted past its all-time high and... kept going. Tech was going insane. Just up, up, up, nonstop. The pandemic was in full-swing, unemployment was through the roof, and tech (and only tech) was going bananas. \n\nSome people said "wtf? this isn\'t right" and shorted QQQ. Other people said "fuck ya" and went long on QQQ.\n\nWhat happened? Shit just kept going up. Longs got rich, shorts got fucked.\n\nA few months later, it turned out that a japanese firm called Softbank was buying mass amounts of calls on specific tech companies to engineer a gamma squeeze. You might hear this referred to in the history books as the "NASDAQ whale." This was the catalyst for what essentially became a euphoria rally, and tech blasted north with crazy speed.\n\nWhat\'s the moral of this story? **It\'s better to be profitable than to be right.**\n\nThe bears were 100% right. There was no logical explanation for the rally, tech was super overvalued, and it should\'ve gone down (or at the very least, hit resistance). But, it doesn\'t matter that they were right. A japanese company was manipulating tech by forcing a gamma squeeze, and they got fucked. Bulls, who basically said "i dunno what\'s up but something is up" made a killing. The easier, "stupider" play was the profitable one, and hugely so.\n\nI think about this when I see all of you guys talking about GME manipulation. You might be right. *But it doesn\'t matter.* When you bet on a stock or an ETF or an industry, you are betting on all the factors - the fundamentals, the manipulation, the powerful interests, the news cycle, the randomness, *everything.*\n\nAnd when you bet against manipulators, you can\'t act like you got screwed when they, you know, manipulate. "Winning" in the market isn\'t about being fair, or about playing by some simple set of rules. It\'s about being clever, and adaptable. And if you think you know that some assholes are gonna manipulate GME, you don\'t bet against it. You bet *on* it. That\'s how you win.\n\nI feel like some of you newer traders are approaching the market incorrectly, and looking at it all wrong. Being right has no value. Money has value. And sometimes, you have to knowingly bet on the wrong thing, or something.\n\nJust something to think about.'), ("Not a YOLO, but I did sell my TSLA to add more fuel to the GME rocket. üíéüëê LET'S GO!

I did my best to reduce the cost basis using covered calls, from $65 all the way down to $51.50, but the stock simply continued to drop. I was forced to cut my losses, and was on the verge of giving the challenge up entirely, but GME came to the rescue and saved the portfolio. I sold the shares too early, but was just happy to break even for the month. But the real icing on the cake was a large bet on SLV at the end of the month which netted a whopping 3k profit, closed today.

No more taking risky bets on dangerous stocks like QS. I will continue to focus mostly on theta gang, wheeling and selling cash-secured puts on high-IV stocks that I am generally bullish on. I may return to PLTR if the price drops a bit from its current highs. Also taking a look at shorted stocks like BBBY if they continue to discount in price.\n\nBeyond that, I'm getting a bearish vibe from the market, and I'm ready to switch gears. Any leftover cash I have after using the bulk of my collateral on CSPs, I may just dump into bearish option bets, such as VXX calls, SPY puts, SLV calls, and the like. This will only be a small portion of my total holdings, however, and I will have to follow the price action carefully before placing such bets.\n\nWill update tomorrow morning with my first February trades.

Also before we get into this, for all the Logitech nerds on my last post, nobody cares that your mom bought you a $10 Logitech keyboard and you like the noises it makes, it doesn't change the fact that Corsair have better quality products for pretty much everything besides mice(my opinion).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk so first things first, we all know that the gaming industry as a whole had boomed due to COVID and has had an increasing TAM for quite some time now and is projected to continue its growth. For that reason alone I'm bullish on a lot of gaming companies other than a few that I believe have way too high of a valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets start with marketing. If any of you have as poor of a social life as I since COVID started then you'd know that Corsair has been very active in social media marketing/sponsorships on Twitch. It feels like I keep seeing more and more streamers show sponsor slides of Corsair gear. This is amazing because in my personal opinion, I believe Twitch and YouTube sponsorships is easily one of the best ways to promote your products(referring to gaming products only). Just look at recent games that have all blown up, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Warzone, and Rust have all blown up due to their large presence on Twitch. Apex Legends and Rust quite literally paid streamers to play the game and look at how well that worked out for them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext up we'll take a look at financials, don't worry I'm not going to sit here and tell you to do your full in depth fundamental analysis reasoning report but I do think we should at least pay attention to it. Even before COVID and still during COVID Corsair has increased revenues, net income, and cash flow. This just adds extra proof that its not like Corsair was a failing company before they got the boost from COVID. Another major positive would be that Corsair has increased focus around R&amp;D which has only proven to significantly help tech companies move ahead of their competitors and acquire more market share. Just a couple companies that also focused R&amp;D would be Tesla(all praise father Elon) and AMD. There's obviously more to the financial aspect however I'd rather not sit here and type out their entire 10-K in a reddit post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, I think with all DD you must point out the negatives as you go along.

Secondly, Corsair's CEO is Andy Paul. How can you put a billion dollar company in the hands of a man with two first names and to be honest, I don't know how they do it.

You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\nThings looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.\n\nNow, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.\n\nBut what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.\n\nMelvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.\n\nOne of two things can happen to these people:\n\n1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able\n2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.\n\nThis logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.\n\nSo what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.\n\nNow, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**\n\nIf shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?\n\nNormally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.\n\nIf they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.\n\nAnother question to consider:\n\nIf shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.\n\nThe final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.\n\nNow, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.\n\nNow, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:\n\n1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.\n2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.\n\n**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.\n\n**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question."), ('Most of the world does not yet realize how big this situation is.', 'Most of the world does not yet realize how big this situation is.First of all, the point of this post is not to tell you how high I think GME will go. This is about how this squeeze is going to affect history.\n\nAll of this short squeeze business is nothing more than a numbers game. We‚Äôve been hearing price targets from $1k to $100k, with $100k being considered outlandishly high.\n\nYes, it‚Äôs a lot of money, but this situation boils down to nothing more than a math problem. Math does not care if its a lot of money.\n\nSo lets look at some numbers. The most similar event we have ever seen in history is the VW squeeze. This was caused by hedge funds owing a short interest of **12%** and Porsche buying up **43%** of the float. VW became the most valuable company in the world, which in GME‚Äôs case would put it at $30,000 per share.\n\nAs we all know, GME was shorted 140%. And Im willing to bet that us üíéü§≤ü¶ç are currently holding well over 43% of the float, with no intention of letting go.\n\nI dont need a phd to tell you what that means for GME.\n\nSo lets say GME hits $100k, which if you look at the numbers, is a massively conservative estimate.\n\nThe hedge funds are dying at $300. At $100k they are going to have to liquidate every asset in their possession to cover their shorts. All their stocks other than GME will be sold. This means the rest of the market is going to plummet. I estimate that march 2020 will look like a joke. The hedge funds will have no way to cover, and someone is going to have to bail them out. **Our economy is about to collapse.**\n\nThe hedge funds know this. Why do you think they are so long on Silver and Gold? Precious metals perform well during recessions. \n\nAndddd because this is WSB, here are my positions:\n- GME shares\n- SPY 374p 2/5\n- SPY 300p 3/1\n- SPY 250p 3/1\n- UVXY 14c 3/1\n- not a single SLV call or share because fuck the hedge funds\n\nTLDR: ü¶çü¶çü¶çüíéü§≤üåàüêª\n\nEdit:\nTo those of you saying I‚Äôm making up numbers:\n\n[VW was shorted 12% and Porsche bought 43%](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/heres-how-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-is-like-the-vw-squeeze-of-2008/ar-BB1d9yVI) \n\nGME as most valuable company in the world: $2.25T/69.5M = $32,375\n\nI used $100k as a lower bounds for the price because we can assume a 10x higher short percent would create more than a 10x higher price, so multiplying by 3 is a safe lower bound.'), ('GME/AMC Failure to Delivers VS Price (Attn: SEC Interns)', "GME/AMC Failure to Delivers VS Price (Attn: SEC Interns)So some of you have noticed that the SEC publishes data for failure to deliver numbers for each symbol every day.  \n\nAfter reading this post by u/johnnydaggers\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/ , I got curious if this theory had legs.\n\nI downloaded all the data for the last 10 years, and charted the daily FTD's vs Price action.

Let‚Äôs look at two two non-retard quotes ‚Äì\n\n***"I have my own theory about why the decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important.

It\'s just that the reasons for liking each of the stocks is different.\n\nFor better or worse - There was a post, I can‚Äôt find it but somebody else can, that showed the Robinhood dashboard that basically said the three most commonly held shares in any given account was, you guessed it $BB, $AMC, and $GGME.\n\nAs you know, Mark Cuban took a break from his busy calendar of being the least retarded Sharktank (No offense Daymond John, I have a soft spot for FUBU but my wife‚Äôs boyfriend no longer lets me rock it) and touching tips with Luka Doncic to [answer some questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lawubt/hey_everyone_its_mark_cuban_jumping_on_to_do_an/). Somebody asked why $GME was taking a nose dive off of Mt. Everest. Per Cuban -\n\n*Supply and Demand, but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled . When RH shut it down, then cut it back, lets put aside why, they cut of the greatest source of demand. They created a RobinHood Dive. No RH buyers, means sellers lower their price to find buyers. And they keep on lowering it till they find buyers. Keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on FALLING.*\n\n*Then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls. When that margin call happens, its brutal. They just take your stock, send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price, no matter how low. They just want to get your cash to pay back the loan.*\n\nSo. Two things re: $BB‚Äôs volatility.\n\n# #1 Stopping buys (but allowing sales) tanked $BB, just like it tanked the other meme stocks. The tin foil apes can keep hawking about citadel etc. but the truth is likely that RObinhood is a tech-focused firm with shitty financial controls and even shittier risk management (GUH). Never ascribe to malice what is usually (and always with that shitshow of an excuse of a company) incompetence. Those dumbasses had a liquidity problem and solved it in the worst way possible. I hope their IPO fails and Vlad steps on a lego.\n\n# #2. The current free fall of $GME / $AMC is still dragging $BB down. Why? What happens when people get margin called?

I have been a long time lurker and have never worked up the courage to post anything of my own. After missing out on the SPY PUT option bonanza that occurred back in March/ April, I vowed I would be put myself in a position to capitalize on the next big thing. Fast forward to GME and while I was a little late to the party, I did get in with everything I could, and regardless of the outcome I have enjoyed myself and have learned more in the last two weeks than during any previous stretch.\n\nMany of the comments on the daily threads center around the price of GME falling and wondering if now is the time to get out. It is common knowledge that we have been the victim of Short Ladder attacks, internal disinformation campaigns, external disinformation campaigns, market manipulation, and straight up suppression. Of specific interest to the neophytes in this community is why the low trading volume last week and especially today matter when the price starts to drop consistently and dramatically, especially during After-Hours trading. \n\nI pulled some Level II data from Robinhood detailing the AH trading volume and the corresponding price decrease. Between the hours of 4 PM EST and 5:55 PM EST, Robinhood shows a total of 475,690 shares traded. When compared to average volume and the corresponding price drop we arrive at the following:\n\n**Shares Traded: 475,690**\n\n**Average Volume: 106,230,000**\n\n**Volume Percentage: 0.448%**\n\nThe closing price at 4 PM was $222.87 and the closing price at 5:55 PM was $176.77 meaning a share price decline of $46.10\n\nDuring AH trading, GME share price fell **20.7%** on trading volume **0.448%** of the current average. THIS IS A MASSIVE ASYMMETRY and in my mind, it supports the idea that the establishment is suppressing this stock to continue scaring us all out of the market.\n\nI rewatched "The Big Short" this afternoon and it was funny to me that in that situation, no one and I mean NO ONE thought any of those guys were right. And when it turned out they were in fact correct, the banks LIED and CONCEALED the true value of the shorts UNTIL they were able to put themselves in a position to try and make money off of the problem they themselves created. Friends, it feels like we are in the same kind of endgame now and I ask that everyone remain diamond-handed and patient. The math is on our side and if it doesn\'t work out it\'s because they found a way to cheat and screw us before we knew what they were doing.'), ("Don't forget why you are here in WSB...", "Don't forget why you are here in WSB...##**...to make money.**\n\nAs one of the OG 2 mil wsb members who was here before the recent influx of new users, I've seen my fair share of gain and loss p0rn over the past couple of years, and I've been on both sides of the trade. Usually my gains or losses have been in the 5 figure range. Whenever I did lose, I have been able to grind my way out and earn it back over the following months. It was still a distant dream to think I'd finally catch a hidden diamond early and ride it to the moon (I missed out on TSLA). I simply did not have the cohones to take the yolo risks like some of you. Then came GME last Nov/Dec with rational fundamental story that had all the traits of a high conviction play that fits my trading style, and you all know the rest of the GME story that comes after that.\n\n##Have an end game. Don't trade emotionally. \n\nLately, I see a lot of people have gotten a bit personal and even political when it comes to GME on this sub. **I'm not here to tell you what your trade should be. Buy, hold, sell, sit on the sidelines and spam memes for easy internet points. Do whatever you want that makes you happy. What I am advocating for is have an exit plan that allows you to walk away without regret.** \n\nIf this means buying shares and holding forever even if it goes to zero, great. If it means taking some profit and holding a core position, great. If it means selling everything and using the profit to improve your own quality of life, great. There is no shame in choosing your own path and executing your own trading strategy.\n\nI say this because I have not slept well in the last 3 weeks, even slacking off on my day job by constantly refreshing /new of WSB. Part of it is excitement, part is FOMO on potential profits. What little sleep I did get were also dreams about GME and imagining the different scenarios play out. So yeah, I went with scenario #2 above where I cashed out a chunk of my initial position last week to lock in 560k+ profits in the $300s, and still holding 1k shares that I will take with me to Valhalla. \n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/hF93IIH\n\nNo matter what happens now, I'm walking away a millionaire courtesy of the awesome people on this sub who take the time and effort to share their DD and strategies with us. *tips hat*\n\n##What's next for GME?\n\nThere's plenty of other DD posts in the sub that will give a better analysis and theories of what might happen this week. Most immediately is that institutions have until tomorrow to deliver shares for calls that expired ITM last Friday. So hopefully there will be some upwards movement, but we have a long way to go to breakout above $400. Even still, this will likely be another gamma squeeze and not a short squeeze as HFs are willing grind their losses back rather than cover and concede a win to retail investors. **This will probably go on for weeks, but the clock is ticking for HFs. The closer we get to the earnings on March 25, the more desperate they will get. I do believe GME management will report insane revenue numbers and profit, and then detail reorg plans for the rest of the year.** This will only encourage anyone still sitting on the sidelines that GME turnaround is legitimate and we have another TSLA-like stock rise to new levels. This will force sell-side institutions to reevaluate and upgrade the stock as well, providing another tailwind for GME. \n\n*Disclaimer:* This is not professional trading advice. This is for entertainment and I just another retard who likes stocks."), ("A collection of Reddit's best research and DD into where GME will go from here", "A collection of Reddit's best research and DD into where GME will go from hereI've been seeing some amazing pieces of DD on GME's situation on Reddit today, but many of them are quickly getting drowned in new posts. So I figured it might be a good moment to collect some of the best DD in a single mega-thread.\n\nI hightly suggest reading these:\n\n* [GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/laln2m/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/)\n* [I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalucf/i_suspect_the_hedgies_are_illegally_covering/)\n* [Follow the crumbs. $GME exposed the meta.](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/)\n* [***READ THIS - THEY ARE SCREWED - NUMBERS DONT LIE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)\n* [$GME is a time bomb and it's highlighting a severe vulnerability in the financial system.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanf94/gme_is_a_time_bomb_and_its_highlighting_a_severe)\n\nDoes it guarantee anything? No. Does it mean it's still incredibly likely that the squeeze will still happen and have insane repurcussions for lots of people/company's bank accounts and the global economy as long as retailers are willing to hold until the end of February? Yes.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any links you think should be added to this list, or if you have any information that debunks any of the links above that I may have missed, because I'm a retard."), ('Stop buying AMD Calls', "Stop buying AMD CallsHey guys,\n\nA lot of you don't know me, as I don't usually post here. I'm usually over at /r/AMD_stock posting DD there. But I'm posting here because the recent activity in the stock led me to realize a huge, glaring problem with the stock's performance and it's latest earnings.\n\nLet me step back a bit first.\n\nLast Friday the stock plummeted 12% after posting the best earnings it possibly could have posted. At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down. The earnings were excellent, the margins were excellent, the guidance for 1Q21 was incredible, and the guidance for FY21 was almost double what the street was expecting. Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. \n\nWhat more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that? You could even see the [bewilderment](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/27/full-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-on-q4-results-product-pipeline-demand-and-more.html) on Lisa Su's face as she started an interview with CNBC the morning after.\n\nWhy? [No financial news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-q4-2020-advanced-micro-devices-earnings/), not even [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/amd-amd-earnings-q4-2020.html), could pin a 'reason' on the drop.\n\nAnd then I realized the problem. It's you.\n\nYou buy the cheapest AMD weeklies you can and hold them through earnings like it can't go tits up. You hope that AMD beats all expectations, and that the stock price skyrockets on your tendie-train choo-choo-ing to the moon. Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!\n\nThe day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.\n\nStop losing at AMD! How? *INVEST PROPERLY*\n\nHow? Buy and hold shares or LEAPS. Stop chasing the mythical overnight gains. AMD is a *long-term success* and it has [room to double](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l6jijo/rosenblatt_securities_says_amd_could_double_in/). DO IT NOW - Price is recovering from the crush, but are still trading at a [20% discount to analyst consensus](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast), and at a 10% discount from it's recent highs.\n\nConclusion: This is a better buy-and-hold than GME, BB, or anything. AMD has grown continuously in the past 5 years and, if you read the DD on /r/AMD_stock, you'll discover that it also has an incredible growth roadmap the next 5 years.\n\nStop losing. Buy shares and double your money.\n\nPositions: 4800 AMD shares @ $27.96"), ('DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?', 'DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it\'s late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or "counterfeit" GME stock, and it\'s there\'s some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you\'re curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they\'re able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I\'ve noticed that\'s been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y\'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don\'t buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI\'m going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day\'s volume**. However, I\'m going to make an assumption that a day\'s volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it\'s using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = \'&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;\'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = \'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=\' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open(\'fail_to_delivers.txt\', \'r\') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split(\'|\');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.\'.\')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print(\'Data for Jan {}\'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res[\'status\'] == \'NOT_FOUND\':\n                print(\'No volume data for {}\'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res[\'volume\']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print(\'{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol\'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + \'M\', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere\'s some code I hacked together myself.

You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\nThings looked bad today, and truthfully I\'m surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.\n\nBut what\'s interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.\n\nMelvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.\n\nOne of two things can happen to these people:\n\n1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able\n2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.\n\nThis logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.\n\nSo what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn\'t add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.\n\nNow, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**\n\nIf shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?\n\nNormally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven\'t covered.\n\nIf they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.\n\nAnother question to consider:\n\nIf shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.\n\nThe final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.\n\nNow, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.\n\nNow, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:\n\n1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.\n2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won\'t be immediately squeezed, it\'s interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.\n\n**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can\'t be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I\'m just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.\n\nCopied off a greaT DD\n\n**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I\'m sorry, I\'m truly trying to find an answer to this question.\n\n**EDIT2:** This all speculation, no one knows what comes next, no one.

SPY hit that resistance and reversed. Didn\'t break all-time highs for quite some time. NASDAQ on the other hand, almost without a hint of resistance, blasted past its all-time high and... kept going. Tech was going insane. Just up, up, up, nonstop. The pandemic was in full-swing, unemployment was through the roof, and tech (and only tech) was going bananas. \n\nSome people said "wtf? this isn\'t right" and shorted QQQ. Other people said "fuck ya" and went long on QQQ.\n\nWhat happened? Shit just kept going up. Longs got rich, shorts got fucked.\n\nA few months later, it turned out that a japanese firm called Softbank was buying mass amounts of calls on specific tech companies to engineer a gamma squeeze. You might hear this referred to in the history books as the "NASDAQ whale." This was the catalyst for what essentially became a euphoria rally, and tech blasted north with crazy speed.\n\nWhat\'s the moral of this story? **It\'s better to be profitable than to be right.**\n\nThe bears were 100% right. There was no logical explanation for the rally, tech was super overvalued, and it should\'ve gone down (or at the very least, hit resistance). But, it doesn\'t matter that they were right. A japanese company was manipulating tech by forcing a gamma squeeze, and they got fucked. Bulls, who basically said "i dunno what\'s up but something is up" made a killing. The easier, "stupider" play was the profitable one, and hugely so.\n\nI think about this when I see all of you guys talking about GME manipulation. You might be right. *But it doesn\'t matter.* When you bet on a stock or an ETF or an industry, you are betting on all the factors - the fundamentals, the manipulation, the powerful interests, the news cycle, the randomness, *everything.*\n\nAnd when you bet against manipulators, you can\'t act like you got screwed when they, you know, manipulate. "Winning" in the market isn\'t about being fair, or about playing by some simple set of rules. It\'s about being clever, and adaptable. And if you think you know that some assholes are gonna manipulate GME, you don\'t bet against it. You bet *on* it. That\'s how you win.\n\nI feel like some of you newer traders are approaching the market incorrectly, and looking at it all wrong. Being right has no value. Money has value. And sometimes, you have to knowingly bet on the wrong thing, or something.\n\nJust something to think about.'), ("Not a YOLO, but I did sell my TSLA to add more fuel to the GME rocket. üíéüëê LET'S GO!

PLTR, FCEL, and ACB all performed excellently. Then I got greedy, and made a huge mistake. I tried to catch the falling knife QS, enticed by the insane premium. It tanked 5-8% nearly every day after. I did my best to reduce the cost basis using covered calls, from $65 all the way down to $51.50, but the stock simply continued to drop. I was forced to cut my losses, and was on the verge of giving the challenge up entirely, but GME came to the rescue and saved the portfolio. I sold the shares too early, but was just happy to break even for the month. But the real icing on the cake was a large bet on SLV at the end of the month which netted a whopping 3k profit, closed today. I didn't like the price action I was seeing on GME today so I dumped it at 250 and will not be reentering the position again.

No more taking risky bets on dangerous stocks like QS. I will continue to focus mostly on theta gang, wheeling and selling cash-secured puts on high-IV stocks that I am generally bullish on. I may return to PLTR if the price drops a bit from its current highs. Also taking a look at shorted stocks like BBBY if they continue to discount in price.\n\nBeyond that, I'm getting a bearish vibe from the market, and I'm ready to switch gears. Any leftover cash I have after using the bulk of my collateral on CSPs, I may just dump into bearish option bets, such as VXX calls, SPY puts, SLV calls, and the like. This will only be a small portion of my total holdings, however, and I will have to follow the price action carefully before placing such bets.\n\nWill update tomorrow morning with my first February trades. Also, at the current rate I will easily break 100% ROI by year end. I may just have to set a more ambitious goal, perhaps 200% ROI?

Also before we get into this, for all the Logitech nerds on my last post, nobody cares that your mom bought you a $10 Logitech keyboard and you like the noises it makes, it doesn't change the fact that Corsair have better quality products for pretty much everything besides mice(my opinion).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk so first things first, we all know that the gaming industry as a whole had boomed due to COVID and has had an increasing TAM for quite some time now and is projected to continue its growth. For that reason alone I'm bullish on a lot of gaming companies other than a few that I believe have way too high of a valuation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets start with marketing. If any of you have as poor of a social life as I since COVID started then you'd know that Corsair has been very active in social media marketing/sponsorships on Twitch. It feels like I keep seeing more and more streamers show sponsor slides of Corsair gear. This is amazing because in my personal opinion, I believe Twitch and YouTube sponsorships is easily one of the best ways to promote your products(referring to gaming products only). Just look at recent games that have all blown up, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Warzone, and Rust have all blown up due to their large presence on Twitch. Apex Legends and Rust quite literally paid streamers to play the game and look at how well that worked out for them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext up we'll take a look at financials, don't worry I'm not going to sit here and tell you to do your full in depth fundamental analysis reasoning report but I do think we should at least pay attention to it. Even before COVID and still during COVID Corsair has increased revenues, net income, and cash flow. This just adds extra proof that its not like Corsair was a failing company before they got the boost from COVID. Another major positive would be that Corsair has increased focus around R&amp;D which has only proven to significantly help tech companies move ahead of their competitors and acquire more market share. Just a couple companies that also focused R&amp;D would be Tesla(all praise father Elon) and AMD. There's obviously more to the financial aspect however I'd rather not sit here and type out their entire 10-K in a reddit post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, I think with all DD you must point out the negatives as you go along. As I stated before, Logitech definitely beats Corsair when it comes to mice. However, I typed this entire post without using a mouse so who really cares about mice. Secondly, Corsair's CEO is Andy Paul. How can you put a billion dollar company in the hands of a man with two first names and to be honest, I don't know how they do it. Although that is definitely a big negative, their logo is extremely cool which I think makes up for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time, now lets preheat this oven and start baking some tendies!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Logitech fanboys please don't attack me in the comments, I don't care about your mice, just leave me alone and go play pong or something with your amazing mouse."), ('So what is happening with BB amd AMC exactly?

You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).\n\nThings looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.\n\nNow, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.\n\nBut what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.\n\nMelvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.\n\nOne of two things can happen to these people:\n\n1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able\n2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.\n\nThis logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.\n\nSo what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.\n\nNow, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**\n\nIf shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?\n\nNormally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.\n\nIf they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.\n\nAnother question to consider:\n\nIf shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.\n\nThe final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.\n\nNow, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.\n\nNow, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:\n\n1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.\n2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.\n\n**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy that loves logic and reasoning.\n\n**EDIT:** For people claiming the liquidity defense, please tell me why trading on TSLA was not blocked during its insane short squeeze. If that sounds aggressive I'm sorry, I'm truly trying to find an answer to this question."), ('Most of the world does not yet realize how big this situation is.', 'Most of the world does not yet realize how big this situation is.First of all, the point of this post is not to tell you how high I think GME will go. This is about how this squeeze is going to affect history.\n\nAll of this short squeeze business is nothing more than a numbers game. We‚Äôve been hearing price targets from $1k to $100k, with $100k being considered outlandishly high.\n\nYes, it‚Äôs a lot of money, but this situation boils down to nothing more than a math problem. Math does not care if its a lot of money.\n\nSo lets look at some numbers. The most similar event we have ever seen in history is the VW squeeze. This was caused by hedge funds owing a short interest of **12%** and Porsche buying up **43%** of the float. VW became the most valuable company in the world, which in GME‚Äôs case would put it at $30,000 per share.\n\nAs we all know, GME was shorted 140%. And Im willing to bet that us üíéü§≤ü¶ç are currently holding well over 43% of the float, with no intention of letting go.\n\nI dont need a phd to tell you what that means for GME.\n\nSo lets say GME hits $100k, which if you look at the numbers, is a massively conservative estimate.\n\nThe hedge funds are dying at $300. At $100k they are going to have to liquidate every asset in their possession to cover their shorts. All their stocks other than GME will be sold. This means the rest of the market is going to plummet. I estimate that march 2020 will look like a joke. The hedge funds will have no way to cover, and someone is going to have to bail them out. **Our economy is about to collapse.**\n\nThe hedge funds know this. Why do you think they are so long on Silver and Gold? Precious metals perform well during recessions. \n\nAndddd because this is WSB, here are my positions:\n- GME shares\n- SPY 374p 2/5\n- SPY 300p 3/1\n- SPY 250p 3/1\n- UVXY 14c 3/1\n- not a single SLV call or share because fuck the hedge funds\n\nTLDR: ü¶çü¶çü¶çüíéü§≤üåàüêª\n\nEdit:\nTo those of you saying I‚Äôm making up numbers:\n\n[VW was shorted 12% and Porsche bought 43%](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/heres-how-the-gamestop-short-squeeze-is-like-the-vw-squeeze-of-2008/ar-BB1d9yVI) \n\nGME as most valuable company in the world: $2.25T/69.5M = $32,375\n\nI used $100k as a lower bounds for the price because we can assume a 10x higher short percent would create more than a 10x higher price, so multiplying by 3 is a safe lower bound.'), ('GME/AMC Failure to Delivers VS Price (Attn: SEC Interns)', "GME/AMC Failure to Delivers VS Price (Attn: SEC Interns)So some of you have noticed that the SEC publishes data for failure to deliver numbers for each symbol every day.  \n\nAfter reading this post by u/johnnydaggers\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/ , I got curious if this theory had legs.\n\nI downloaded all the data for the last 10 years, and charted the daily FTD's vs Price action.

I have been a long time lurker and have never worked up the courage to post anything of my own. After missing out on the SPY PUT option bonanza that occurred back in March/ April, I vowed I would be put myself in a position to capitalize on the next big thing. Fast forward to GME and while I was a little late to the party, I did get in with everything I could, and regardless of the outcome I have enjoyed myself and have learned more in the last two weeks than during any previous stretch.\n\nMany of the comments on the daily threads center around the price of GME falling and wondering if now is the time to get out. It is common knowledge that we have been the victim of Short Ladder attacks, internal disinformation campaigns, external disinformation campaigns, market manipulation, and straight up suppression. Of specific interest to the neophytes in this community is why the low trading volume last week and especially today matter when the price starts to drop consistently and dramatically, especially during After-Hours trading. \n\nI pulled some Level II data from Robinhood detailing the AH trading volume and the corresponding price decrease. Between the hours of 4 PM EST and 5:55 PM EST, Robinhood shows a total of 475,690 shares traded. When compared to average volume and the corresponding price drop we arrive at the following:\n\n**Shares Traded: 475,690**\n\n**Average Volume: 106,230,000**\n\n**Volume Percentage: 0.448%**\n\nThe closing price at 4 PM was $222.87 and the closing price at 5:55 PM was $176.77 meaning a share price decline of $46.10\n\nDuring AH trading, GME share price fell **20.7%** on trading volume **0.448%** of the current average. THIS IS A MASSIVE ASYMMETRY and in my mind, it supports the idea that the establishment is suppressing this stock to continue scaring us all out of the market.\n\nI rewatched "The Big Short" this afternoon and it was funny to me that in that situation, no one and I mean NO ONE thought any of those guys were right. And when it turned out they were in fact correct, the banks LIED and CONCEALED the true value of the shorts UNTIL they were able to put themselves in a position to try and make money off of the problem they themselves created. Friends, it feels like we are in the same kind of endgame now and I ask that everyone remain diamond-handed and patient. The math is on our side and if it doesn\'t work out it\'s because they found a way to cheat and screw us before we knew what they were doing.'), ("Don't forget why you are here in WSB...", "Don't forget why you are here in WSB...##**...to make money.**\n\nAs one of the OG 2 mil wsb members who was here before the recent influx of new users, I've seen my fair share of gain and loss p0rn over the past couple of years, and I've been on both sides of the trade. Usually my gains or losses have been in the 5 figure range. Whenever I did lose, I have been able to grind my way out and earn it back over the following months. It was still a distant dream to think I'd finally catch a hidden diamond early and ride it to the moon (I missed out on TSLA). I simply did not have the cohones to take the yolo risks like some of you. Then came GME last Nov/Dec with rational fundamental story that had all the traits of a high conviction play that fits my trading style, and you all know the rest of the GME story that comes after that.\n\n##Have an end game. Don't trade emotionally. \n\nLately, I see a lot of people have gotten a bit personal and even political when it comes to GME on this sub. **I'm not here to tell you what your trade should be. Buy, hold, sell, sit on the sidelines and spam memes for easy internet points. Do whatever you want that makes you happy. What I am advocating for is have an exit plan that allows you to walk away without regret.** \n\nIf this means buying shares and holding forever even if it goes to zero, great. If it means taking some profit and holding a core position, great. If it means selling everything and using the profit to improve your own quality of life, great. There is no shame in choosing your own path and executing your own trading strategy.\n\nI say this because I have not slept well in the last 3 weeks, even slacking off on my day job by constantly refreshing /new of WSB. Part of it is excitement, part is FOMO on potential profits. What little sleep I did get were also dreams about GME and imagining the different scenarios play out. So yeah, I went with scenario #2 above where I cashed out a chunk of my initial position last week to lock in 560k+ profits in the $300s, and still holding 1k shares that I will take with me to Valhalla. \n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/hF93IIH\n\nNo matter what happens now, I'm walking away a millionaire courtesy of the awesome people on this sub who take the time and effort to share their DD and strategies with us. *tips hat*\n\n##What's next for GME?\n\nThere's plenty of other DD posts in the sub that will give a better analysis and theories of what might happen this week. Most immediately is that institutions have until tomorrow to deliver shares for calls that expired ITM last Friday. So hopefully there will be some upwards movement, but we have a long way to go to breakout above $400. Even still, this will likely be another gamma squeeze and not a short squeeze as HFs are willing grind their losses back rather than cover and concede a win to retail investors. **This will probably go on for weeks, but the clock is ticking for HFs. The closer we get to the earnings on March 25, the more desperate they will get. I do believe GME management will report insane revenue numbers and profit, and then detail reorg plans for the rest of the year.** This will only encourage anyone still sitting on the sidelines that GME turnaround is legitimate and we have another TSLA-like stock rise to new levels. This will force sell-side institutions to reevaluate and upgrade the stock as well, providing another tailwind for GME. \n\n*Disclaimer:* This is not professional trading advice. This is for entertainment and I just another retard who likes stocks."), ("A collection of Reddit's best research and DD into where GME will go from here", "A collection of Reddit's best research and DD into where GME will go from hereI've been seeing some amazing pieces of DD on GME's situation on Reddit today, but many of them are quickly getting drowned in new posts. So I figured it might be a good moment to collect some of the best DD in a single mega-thread.\n\nI hightly suggest reading these:\n\n* [GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next ](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/laln2m/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/)\n* [I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lalucf/i_suspect_the_hedgies_are_illegally_covering/)\n* [Follow the crumbs. $GME exposed the meta.](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/)\n* [***READ THIS - THEY ARE SCREWED - NUMBERS DONT LIE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laoaru/read_this_they_are_screwed_numbers_dont_lie/)\n* [$GME is a time bomb and it's highlighting a severe vulnerability in the financial system.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lanf94/gme_is_a_time_bomb_and_its_highlighting_a_severe)\n\nDoes it guarantee anything? No. Does it mean it's still incredibly likely that the squeeze will still happen and have insane repurcussions for lots of people/company's bank accounts and the global economy as long as retailers are willing to hold until the end of February? Yes.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any links you think should be added to this list, or if you have any information that debunks any of the links above that I may have missed, because I'm a retard."), ('DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?', 'DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it\'s late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or "counterfeit" GME stock, and it\'s there\'s some systematic fraud going on.\n\nMuch of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you\'re curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they\'re able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.\n\nOne thing I\'ve noticed that\'s been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y\'all make some informed decisions.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don\'t buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n**Methodology**\n\nI\'m going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that\n\n1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.\n2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day\'s volume**. However, I\'m going to make an assumption that a day\'s volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.\n3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it\'s using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date\n\nHowever, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.\n\n**The Code**\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    import time\n    import requests\n    POLYGON_API_KEY = \'&lt;ADD YOUR API KEY HERE&gt;\'\n    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = \'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&amp;apiKey=\' + POLYGON_API_KEY\n    \n    data\n    dates_to_stocks = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(float))\n    f = open(\'fail_to_delivers.txt\', \'r\') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm\n    for line in f:\n        parts = line.split(\'|\');\n        date = parts[0]\n        ticker = parts[2]\n        try:\n            fails = int(parts[3])\n            price = float(parts[5])\n            value_of_fails = price * fails\n            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)\n        except ValueError:\n            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.\'.\')\n            pass\n    \n    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():\n        day = int(date[-2:])\n        print(\'Data for Jan {}\'.format(day))\n        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])\n        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] &gt; 10000000, sorted_stocks)\n        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:\n            val_of_fails = data[0]\n            num_fails = data[1]\n            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))\n            res = req.json()\n            if res[\'status\'] == \'NOT_FOUND\':\n                print(\'No volume data for {}\'.format(ticker))\n                continue\n            else:\n                try:\n                    volume = res[\'volume\']\n                except KeyError:\n                    print(res)\n            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)\n            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100\n            print(\'{: &lt;6} ${: &lt;5} {: &lt;9} / {: &lt; 12} {:.2f}% of vol\'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + \'M\', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))\n\nHere\'s some code I hacked together myself.

SPY hit that resistance and reversed. Didn\'t break all-time highs for quite some time. NASDAQ on the other hand, almost without a hint of resistance, blasted past its all-time high and... kept going. Tech was going insane. Just up, up, up, nonstop. The pandemic was in full-swing, unemployment was through the roof, and tech (and only tech) was going bananas. \n\nSome people said "wtf? this isn\'t right" and shorted QQQ. Other people said "fuck ya" and went long on QQQ.\n\nWhat happened? Shit just kept going up. Longs got rich, shorts got fucked.\n\nA few months later, it turned out that a japanese firm called Softbank was buying mass amounts of calls on specific tech companies to engineer a gamma squeeze. You might hear this referred to in the history books as the "NASDAQ whale." This was the catalyst for what essentially became a euphoria rally, and tech blasted north with crazy speed.\n\nWhat\'s the moral of this story? **It\'s better to be profitable than to be right.**\n\nThe bears were 100% right. There was no logical explanation for the rally, tech was super overvalued, and it should\'ve gone down (or at the very least, hit resistance). But, it doesn\'t matter that they were right. A japanese company was manipulating tech by forcing a gamma squeeze, and they got fucked. Bulls, who basically said "i dunno what\'s up but something is up" made a killing. The easier, "stupider" play was the profitable one, and hugely so.\n\nI think about this when I see all of you guys talking about GME manipulation. You might be right. *But it doesn\'t matter.* When you bet on a stock or an ETF or an industry, you are betting on all the factors - the fundamentals, the manipulation, the powerful interests, the news cycle, the randomness, *everything.*\n\nAnd when you bet against manipulators, you can\'t act like you got screwed when they, you know, manipulate. "Winning" in the market isn\'t about being fair, or about playing by some simple set of rules. It\'s about being clever, and adaptable. And if you think you know that some assholes are gonna manipulate GME, you don\'t bet against it. You bet *on* it. That\'s how you win.\n\nI feel like some of you newer traders are approaching the market incorrectly, and looking at it all wrong. Being right has no value. Money has value.

PLTR, FCEL, and ACB all performed excellently. Then I got greedy, and made a huge mistake. I tried to catch the falling knife QS, enticed by the insane premium. It tanked 5-8% nearly every day after. I did my best to reduce the cost basis using covered calls, from $65 all the way down to $51.50, but the stock simply continued to drop. I was forced to cut my losses, and was on the verge of giving the challenge up entirely, but GME came to the rescue and saved the portfolio. I sold the shares too early, but was just happy to break even for the month. But the real icing on the cake was a large bet on SLV at the end of the month which netted a whopping 3k profit, closed today. I didn't like the price action I was seeing on GME today so I dumped it at 250 and will not be reentering the position again.

No more taking risky bets on dangerous stocks like QS. I will continue to focus mostly on theta gang, wheeling and selling cash-secured puts on high-IV stocks that I am generally bullish on. I may return to PLTR if the price drops a bit from its current highs. Also taking a look at shorted stocks like BBBY if they continue to discount in price.\n\nBeyond that, I'm getting a bearish vibe from the market, and I'm ready to switch gears. Any leftover cash I have after using the bulk of my collateral on CSPs, I may just dump into bearish option bets, such as VXX calls, SPY puts, SLV calls, and the like. This will only be a small portion of my total holdings, however, and I will have to follow the price action carefully before placing such bets.\n\nWill update tomorrow morning with my first February trades. Also, at the current rate I will easily break 100% ROI by year end. I may just have to set a more ambitious goal, perhaps 200% ROI?

Love you guys üöÄ', "GME brief recap. Why did you buy GME in the first place? Hope to see more DDs instead of cultposting. Love you guys üöÄTLDR: Brief recap - fundamentals are still fun, and may be getting better. Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.\n\nI am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.\n\n**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**\n\nI think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.\n\nYou know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. \n\nNote: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.\n\n**Microsoft revenue sharing**\n\nGME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?\n\n**PC building kiosk**\n\nKnow microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:\n\n\\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently\n\n\\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get üöÄ. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.\n\n\\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.\n\nPosition GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.\n\nWhat about the squeeze?"), ("Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANT", "Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANTI like many of you work a shit job where I'm underpaid, exploited, stressed and angry. Today I found out in the coming weeks us disposable workers are about to get a shit more work, responsibility and stress going forward. After layoffs, paycuts, tightening our builts, closing offices permanently and working from home permanently I get to experience more suffering.\n\nSo that brings me to GME and the hedgefunds. I like you jumped on this movement, because that's what it is at this point, and bought one GME share because I suck and don't have the nerves of you seasoned monkeys when it comes to stocks (rip my 4 TSLA shares circa 2017). I saw what hedgefunds were trying to do and how us normal people, gamers, boyfriends, degenerates could capitalize and actually win for once in this shitty rigged system that fucks us over every day from work wages to healthcare and taxes. I was amazed at how mainstream media said fuck me when I tried to make money and was calling for bullshit regulation and peddling silver because me a guy almost 30 who has done nothing but go to college to get a worthless price of paper following the 08 crash and be told just work hard and you'll get ahead.

Robinhood suddenly locking out of my account that has been dormant for two year, fuck you Vlad by the way, hope you go to prison. Fidelity fuck the world.\n\nSo I'm holding my 1 share. I've debated on selling to cut my losses but who the fuck cares. If this destroys a hedgefund fucking good! If I have to hold until it's worth $5 I will. These fucking banker and financial cunts need to lose and suffer like we do daily.

NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)\n\nFirst, in regards to Nokia‚Äôs business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia‚Äôs current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&amp;T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. \n\n[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)\n\nNokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn‚Äôt a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won‚Äôt happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer‚Äôs where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.\n\nAt 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&amp;P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. \n\nWith that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ \n\nThe second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump‚Äôs ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don‚Äôt think this is likely. But it‚Äôs certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&amp;D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.\n\nIt should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares. \n\nForm SC 13G/A Nokia Corp.

The increase is a good question. \n\nNow you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. \n\nFinal words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered.'), ('$GME, what comes next?', "$GME, what comes next?Let's establish the main opinion behind what I am going to type - GME  will not become bankrupt in the short term. If you believe GME will go  bankrupt within the next few months, then my thesis is completely  broken.\n\nThe shortsellers were betting on bankruptcy. That's why they dared to  short GME &gt;100%. If GME went bankrupt, they would get more money than  what GME was initially worth.\n\nThat's literally printing money out of thin air. But it absolutely  requires GME to become bankrupt, so that the extra shorted shares will  never ever have to be bought back.\n\nNow, if we can agree GME won't go bankrupt at this point. So what happens next?\n\nWhen the share price drops, 3 things happen:\n\n1. paper handers sell\n2. diamond handers buy\n3. short sellers must cover\n\nAs prices drop, #1 will get fewer as they sell. Since share price won't  go to 0, #3 will want to cover at the dip as much as possible. #2 will  buy in massively. At this stage, liquidity evaporates. What happens  then? MOASS.\n\nThis is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze. The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up. For this, we will need to trust Papa Cohen. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: 1000 GME shares,   üíéüçÜüôå"), ('Say it together with me, kiddos: I-N-V-E-S-T-I-N-G', 'Say it together with me, kiddos: I-N-V-E-S-T-I-N-GYes, this is a casino. Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there\'s an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.\n\nIf there\'s one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it\'s that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you\'d like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.\n\nHopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It\'s the most accessible and I\'m all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren\'t investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you\'ve already missed the "value" phase and you\'re basically banking on something that\'s hard to pin down.\n\nIt\'s a slippery basis for an investment, but it\'s made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here\'s the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won\'t get you to tendie town. That\'s trading, not investing, and trading doesn\'t work out well for most people.\n\nThe unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it\'s a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you\'re an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can\'t sell at the peak. I think it\'s all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren\'t approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you\'re like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.\n\nI\'d argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they\'re investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a "movement" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins. You can attach a face to it - Melvin Capital, Citadel, whatever - but it is inherently faceless.\n\nDFV didn\'t initially invest in a meme, or a movement - he invested in a (deep fucking) value proposition informed by his analysis of where Gamestop stood as a company and where it was heading. And then, as we all know, he held. And that\'s exactly what he has in common with WSB\'s other luminaries.\n\nIf you can see what the market doesn\'t yet see, put a chunk on the line that you can afford to lose, and *wait* (that\'s the important part) then you might have some juicy gain porn of your own to post in a year or two. You need conviction, though, or you\'ll just spend all your time looking at the tickers that made it big that day and move on to the next, sexier play. The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail. Maybe that\'s the part of the road you\'re on right now, but it\'s a good start.\n\nEdited for TL;DR - Know the difference between trading and investing, and try to do more of the latter.

That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGenerally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36.

In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄNow, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations.

For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.\n\n[MPDV Purpose Built Vehicle](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) \n\nCanoo‚Äôs leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 &amp; i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. \n\nThe real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that‚Äôs not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car‚Ä¶ the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject.

Here is how investopedia describes it:\n\n"Though the SEC oversees brokers who issue short-sale orders, they do not execute regularly scheduled audits or required regularly filed reports by brokers. Instead, the SEC expects broker-dealers to be self regulating, by maintaining their own records which are subject to audit at any time. With this in mind, broker-dealers are required to document their polices for how they mark orders as exempt, and, if audited, provide evidence that they have followed their documented policies and procedures.\n\nBroker-dealers therefore mark an order short exempt if they believe it qualifies for an exception. The primary exception is the use of non-standard pricing quotes for trade execution. That means that if prices come in outside the [National Best Bid or Offer (NBBO)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nbbo.asp), they can initiate a short-sale order that they judge would have qualified as an uptick in more orderly markets. Marking for these orders is signified by SSE. All orders marked SSE will be closely checked by self-regulatory organizations and the SEC for compliance with Regulation SHO exceptions."\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortexempt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortexempt.asp)\n\nI don\'t know jack shit about what this means, and I\'m not a financial advisor, which is why I\'m asking for someone who knows more about this to explain the significance of this. Does this help support the argument that Hedgies/brokers are circumventing the NBBO for ladder attacks when LULD rule is triggered? Were there frequent enough trading halts since Jan 28th for this to have a significant impact? AAPL and Ford have very small but non-existent data for Exempt short volume, and I\'m not aware of any limit rules applied to them over the last few days, so where did their exempt short volume come from?\n\nMy position is \\~50 shares of GME at \\~$120. Small long positions in some of the other securities mentioned, but GME is by far the biggest.'), ('Clarification on "short ladder" attacks and Round Lots vs Odd Lots', 'Clarification on "short ladder" attacks and Round Lots vs Odd LotsSo I have seen a lot of posts pointing to GME (and others) volume as an indication of short ladder attacks. While I‚Äôm not claiming they are or aren‚Äôt happening, I think it is important to understand how institutional trading works. For reference, I work on the sell side so im a semi-suit (im not an execution trader, but I have enough friends who are).\n\nYou may notice that these stocks trade in 100 share increments, this is by design and has a name, they‚Äôre called ‚Äúround lots‚Äù and are used to break up large orders. These round lots are used by every single institution in order to not smash through the bid/ask walls and ensure orderly markets. They are not evidence of a short ladder attack.\n\nThink about it, if a fund wanted to buy $1,000,000,000 worth of AAPL, they could never place a market order as they would move the market against them, and a limit order would never fill. They could use a dark pool to buy without advertising their order, or find a willing partner for a block trade. They also, very frequently have to use low touch VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) algos (much different than prop algos) to buy in the open markets on an exchange. These algorithms ingest the order, and then execute the trade based on a predefined % of volume, ie. the sell side execution trader never wants his/her orders to take up more than xx% of volume. As the algo operates throughout the day, it executes thousands of round lot trades. These round lot trades are the 100 share increments you see each day. All the 100 share increments mean is that you are seeing institutional volume mixed in with odd lot trades (blocks not in increments of 100 shares).\n\n**TLDR:** 100 share blocks are round lots and are not in any way an indication of a short ladder attack, they simply show institutional order flow.\n\n**Positions:** 30 shares of GME at $14.07\n\nMost importantly... **HOLD THE LINE**\n\nEdits with interesting questions:\n\n**Q: If you\'re going to execute a short ladder attack it makes sense to choose a round number like 100**\n\nA: They\'re not choosing 100 shares, their order is much larger, probably thousands or tens of thousands of shares. The algo breaks up that order into 100 share round lots and executes the trade. The reason for this is simple, its easy to match  100 share lots than it is to try to piece together orders. If the seller is asking $xx.xx for 100 shares, the buyer can bid $xx.xx for 100 shares and the match is made. If you have 13 shares at one price, 29 shares at another price, and 91 shares at another price on both the bid and ask side, complexity increases materially.\n\n**Q: Why do I see a lot of odd lots in AH trading?**\n\nA: Because order flow from retail brokerages too thin to combine market orders into a single round lot once it makes its way over to a MM, so they just execute an odd lot order. It is what they have to do and is the last part of my answer above.'), ('$TSLA 6K GAIN FROM OVERNIGHT SWING', '$TSLA 6K GAIN FROM OVERNIGHT SWINGDecided to swing $TSLA long from yesterday after close\n\nThesis:\n\n\\- Relative strength vs spy\n\n\\- still oversold from ER selloff and historically TSLA recovers sharply + w momentum from selloffs\n\n\\- bids were taking out offers all day on the tape\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmpxr0u4u6f61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb4a8c0e8bb6b74a417a0a0d4c512561e0376f7e'), ('Spy Bear turned GME bull gain', 'Spy Bear turned GME bull gain[deleted]'), ('I made a FINRA GME Short Sale Data Chart', "I made a FINRA GME Short Sale Data ChartHey team,\n\nI'm retarded but I took this post from  [u/meta-cognizant](https://www.reddit.com/user/meta-cognizant/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the\\_ratio\\_of\\_short\\_volume\\_to\\_total\\_volume/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the_ratio_of_short_volume_to_total_volume/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nedit; I was retarded, updated charts and table.\n\nHere is what FINRA Short data look like:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Lots of Short volume especially an uptick the last two days.](https://preview.redd.it/1refamhwf7f61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3da848588060fbb6d9507bde9864f2747c95a31b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Very high short volume as a percentage of total volume, which has only been increasing in the past week.](https://preview.redd.it/uluzz83ts7f61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6502d827857db2bd4e7a25c862523d0bb9318e9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm retarded but here is a data table just in case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yyip369xs7f61.png?width=955&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=256cf46428fb5b6b270a1f2804252b13bb4a4aa0"), ('DD for $AB', "DD for $ABBefore I begin this DD, no this is not the next GME.

Since I like forbidden fruits, I went ahead and did my own research on the company. I\'m sharing the results with you:\n\nNova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company (with 18 offices worldwide) that provides metrology solutions (devices and software) for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nMetrology means measuring, and in this context, super precise measuring (nanometer or smaller) required for semiconductor manufacturing. The company\'s metrology solutions use technologies including Optical Scatterometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), scatterometry modeling software, and high-performance computing. The company holds 30 patents in this field.\n\nMarket cap: \\~2.2 Billion\n\nP/E ratio: \\~42\n\nHas beaten earning expectations in the past 4 quarters (didn\'t check further back)\n\nThe stock price has grown almost 100% in the last year, which is good but nothing compared to NNDM, for instance, which has grown 540%.\n\nDaily volume is low (about 150,000)\n\nIn a recent (Jan 28, 2021) [press release](https://www.novami.com/investors/press-releases/nova-receives-multiple-materials-metrology-orders-from-leading-logic-and-foundry-customers/), the company announced that it "received multiple orders from multiple leading Logic and Foundry customers for its most advanced materials metrology solutions."  They don\'t name the new clients, but could one of them be $TSM?\n\nAnyway, we know that all sorts of trendy technologies such as EVs, AI, Cloud, etc. need processors and memory devices, which brings our attention to companies such as $AMD, $INTC, $ON, and $TSM. But these companies in turn need precise measuring devices for their process control, and NVMI is the leader in that area.\n\nThe company\'s technology/patents can also be useful in 3D printers that print precise things (again, such as NNDM).\n\nI did a quick search and it seems no one has done a DD on this in WSB.

Love you guys üöÄ', "GME brief recap. Why did you buy GME in the first place? Hope to see more DDs instead of cultposting. Love you guys üöÄTLDR: Brief recap - fundamentals are still fun, and may be getting better. Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.\n\nI am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.\n\n**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**\n\nI think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.\n\nYou know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. \n\nNote: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.\n\n**Microsoft revenue sharing**\n\nGME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?\n\n**PC building kiosk**\n\nKnow microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:\n\n\\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently\n\n\\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get üöÄ. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.\n\n\\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.\n\nPosition GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.\n\nWhat about the squeeze?"), ("Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANT", "Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANTI like many of you work a shit job where I'm underpaid, exploited, stressed and angry. Today I found out in the coming weeks us disposable workers are about to get a shit more work, responsibility and stress going forward. After layoffs, paycuts, tightening our builts, closing offices permanently and working from home permanently I get to experience more suffering.\n\nSo that brings me to GME and the hedgefunds. I like you jumped on this movement, because that's what it is at this point, and bought one GME share because I suck and don't have the nerves of you seasoned monkeys when it comes to stocks (rip my 4 TSLA shares circa 2017). I saw what hedgefunds were trying to do and how us normal people, gamers, boyfriends, degenerates could capitalize and actually win for once in this shitty rigged system that fucks us over every day from work wages to healthcare and taxes. I was amazed at how mainstream media said fuck me when I tried to make money and was calling for bullshit regulation and peddling silver because me a guy almost 30 who has done nothing but go to college to get a worthless price of paper following the 08 crash and be told just work hard and you'll get ahead. I've been exploited by shit jobs, government who doesn't give a shit about me (hey here's two measiy still checks to compensate for another 10 years of no wage growth) and now a fucking financial system so fucking rigged that even criminals like Pablo Escobar would in awe if he were alive. Robinhood suddenly locking out of my account that has been dormant for two year, fuck you Vlad by the way, hope you go to prison. Fidelity fuck the world.\n\nSo I'm holding my 1 share. I've debated on selling to cut my losses but who the fuck cares. If this destroys a hedgefund fucking good! If I have to hold until it's worth $5 I will. These fucking banker and financial cunts need to lose and suffer like we do daily. They don't know what it's like to enyer a shit job market and be stuck in it for a fucking decade and ask for fucking tax breaks and still do illegal shit like blatantly manipularlte the free market.\n\nI've platinumed Battlefield 4 and over 30 other games.

NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)\n\nFirst, in regards to Nokia‚Äôs business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia‚Äôs current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&amp;T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. \n\n[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)\n\nNokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn‚Äôt a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won‚Äôt happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer‚Äôs where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.\n\nAt 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&amp;P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. \n\nWith that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ \n\nThe second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump‚Äôs ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don‚Äôt think this is likely. But it‚Äôs certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&amp;D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.\n\nIt should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares. \n\nForm SC 13G/A Nokia Corp.

The increase is a good question. \n\nNow you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. \n\nFinal words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered.'), ('$GME, what comes next?', "$GME, what comes next?Let's establish the main opinion behind what I am going to type - GME  will not become bankrupt in the short term.

MOASS.\n\nThis is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze. The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up. For this, we will need to trust Papa Cohen. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: 1000 GME shares,   üíéüçÜüôå"), ('Say it together with me, kiddos: I-N-V-E-S-T-I-N-G', 'Say it together with me, kiddos: I-N-V-E-S-T-I-N-GYes, this is a casino. Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there\'s an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.\n\nIf there\'s one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it\'s that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you\'d like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.\n\nHopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It\'s the most accessible and I\'m all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren\'t investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you\'ve already missed the "value" phase and you\'re basically banking on something that\'s hard to pin down.\n\nIt\'s a slippery basis for an investment, but it\'s made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here\'s the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won\'t get you to tendie town. That\'s trading, not investing, and trading doesn\'t work out well for most people.\n\nThe unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it\'s a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you\'re an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can\'t sell at the peak. I think it\'s all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren\'t approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you\'re like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.\n\nI\'d argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they\'re investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a "movement" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins. You can attach a face to it - Melvin Capital, Citadel, whatever - but it is inherently faceless.\n\nDFV didn\'t initially invest in a meme, or a movement - he invested in a (deep fucking) value proposition informed by his analysis of where Gamestop stood as a company and where it was heading. And then, as we all know, he held. And that\'s exactly what he has in common with WSB\'s other luminaries.\n\nIf you can see what the market doesn\'t yet see, put a chunk on the line that you can afford to lose, and *wait* (that\'s the important part) then you might have some juicy gain porn of your own to post in a year or two. You need conviction, though, or you\'ll just spend all your time looking at the tickers that made it big that day and move on to the next, sexier play. The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail. Maybe that\'s the part of the road you\'re on right now, but it\'s a good start.\n\nEdited for TL;DR - Know the difference between trading and investing, and try to do more of the latter.

The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGenerally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36.

In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄNow, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations.

While I‚Äôm not claiming they are or aren‚Äôt happening, I think it is important to understand how institutional trading works. For reference, I work on the sell side so im a semi-suit (im not an execution trader, but I have enough friends who are).\n\nYou may notice that these stocks trade in 100 share increments, this is by design and has a name, they‚Äôre called ‚Äúround lots‚Äù and are used to break up large orders. These round lots are used by every single institution in order to not smash through the bid/ask walls and ensure orderly markets. They are not evidence of a short ladder attack.\n\nThink about it, if a fund wanted to buy $1,000,000,000 worth of AAPL, they could never place a market order as they would move the market against them, and a limit order would never fill. They could use a dark pool to buy without advertising their order, or find a willing partner for a block trade. They also, very frequently have to use low touch VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) algos (much different than prop algos) to buy in the open markets on an exchange. These algorithms ingest the order, and then execute the trade based on a predefined % of volume, ie. the sell side execution trader never wants his/her orders to take up more than xx% of volume. As the algo operates throughout the day, it executes thousands of round lot trades. These round lot trades are the 100 share increments you see each day. All the 100 share increments mean is that you are seeing institutional volume mixed in with odd lot trades (blocks not in increments of 100 shares).\n\n**TLDR:** 100 share blocks are round lots and are not in any way an indication of a short ladder attack, they simply show institutional order flow.\n\n**Positions:** 30 shares of GME at $14.07\n\nMost importantly... **HOLD THE LINE**\n\nEdits with interesting questions:\n\n**Q: If you\'re going to execute a short ladder attack it makes sense to choose a round number like 100**\n\nA: They\'re not choosing 100 shares, their order is much larger, probably thousands or tens of thousands of shares. The algo breaks up that order into 100 share round lots and executes the trade. The reason for this is simple, its easy to match  100 share lots than it is to try to piece together orders. If the seller is asking $xx.xx for 100 shares, the buyer can bid $xx.xx for 100 shares and the match is made. If you have 13 shares at one price, 29 shares at another price, and 91 shares at another price on both the bid and ask side, complexity increases materially.\n\n**Q: Why do I see a lot of odd lots in AH trading?**\n\nA: Because order flow from retail brokerages too thin to combine market orders into a single round lot once it makes its way over to a MM, so they just execute an odd lot order. It is what they have to do and is the last part of my answer above.'), ('$TSLA 6K GAIN FROM OVERNIGHT SWING', '$TSLA 6K GAIN FROM OVERNIGHT SWINGDecided to swing $TSLA long from yesterday after close\n\nThesis:\n\n\\- Relative strength vs spy\n\n\\- still oversold from ER selloff and historically TSLA recovers sharply + w momentum from selloffs\n\n\\- bids were taking out offers all day on the tape\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmpxr0u4u6f61.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb4a8c0e8bb6b74a417a0a0d4c512561e0376f7e'), ('I made a FINRA GME Short Sale Data Chart', "I made a FINRA GME Short Sale Data ChartHey team,\n\nI'm retarded but I took this post from  [u/meta-cognizant](https://www.reddit.com/user/meta-cognizant/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the\\_ratio\\_of\\_short\\_volume\\_to\\_total\\_volume/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&amp;utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbavu0/the_ratio_of_short_volume_to_total_volume/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nedit; I was retarded, updated charts and table.\n\nHere is what FINRA Short data look like:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Lots of Short volume especially an uptick the last two days.](https://preview.redd.it/1refamhwf7f61.png?width=481&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3da848588060fbb6d9507bde9864f2747c95a31b)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Very high short volume as a percentage of total volume, which has only been increasing in the past week.](https://preview.redd.it/uluzz83ts7f61.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6502d827857db2bd4e7a25c862523d0bb9318e9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm retarded but here is a data table just in case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yyip369xs7f61.png?width=955&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=256cf46428fb5b6b270a1f2804252b13bb4a4aa0"), ('DD for $AB', "DD for $ABBefore I begin this DD, no this is not the next GME.

I\'m sharing the results with you:\n\nNova Measuring Instruments is an Israel-based company (with 18 offices worldwide) that provides metrology solutions (devices and software) for advanced process control used in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nMetrology means measuring, and in this context, super precise measuring (nanometer or smaller) required for semiconductor manufacturing. The company\'s metrology solutions use technologies including Optical Scatterometry, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF), scatterometry modeling software, and high-performance computing. The company holds 30 patents in this field.\n\nMarket cap: \\~2.2 Billion\n\nP/E ratio: \\~42\n\nHas beaten earning expectations in the past 4 quarters (didn\'t check further back)\n\nThe stock price has grown almost 100% in the last year, which is good but nothing compared to NNDM, for instance, which has grown 540%.\n\nDaily volume is low (about 150,000)\n\nIn a recent (Jan 28, 2021) [press release](https://www.novami.com/investors/press-releases/nova-receives-multiple-materials-metrology-orders-from-leading-logic-and-foundry-customers/), the company announced that it "received multiple orders from multiple leading Logic and Foundry customers for its most advanced materials metrology solutions."  They don\'t name the new clients, but could one of them be $TSM?\n\nAnyway, we know that all sorts of trendy technologies such as EVs, AI, Cloud, etc. need processors and memory devices, which brings our attention to companies such as $AMD, $INTC, $ON, and $TSM. But these companies in turn need precise measuring devices for their process control, and NVMI is the leader in that area.\n\nThe company\'s technology/patents can also be useful in 3D printers that print precise things (again, such as NNDM).\n\nI did a quick search and it seems no one has done a DD on this in WSB. I think it has great growth potential both short term and long term. Once WB is over the BANG stocks, this is something worth a look at. IMO, it will be similar to stocks like MGNI and SE that consistently move up without much buzz around them on WSB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTechnicals:\n\nI don\'t know much about technicals but according to tradingview, it\'s neutral based on oscillators, and strong buy based on moving averages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy positions:Stocks80C 5/21/2021\n\nThe options market for this stock is low volume and there are large gaps between bid/ask prices, so I suggest going with the stocks.'), ('Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and hold', 'Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and holdEvery other comment right now is a shill lamenting the stupidity of everyone who‚Äôs still holding or how sad it is the big guy won again or some other gloomy horseshit. \n\nTo all of you who are out there who‚Äôve ever thought ‚Äúoh man, if I‚Äôd only bought X stock X years ago I‚Äôd be rich!‚Äù - if you aren‚Äôt holding right now, you‚Äôre wrong. \n\nI‚Äôm an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value.

Love you guys üöÄ', "GME brief recap. Why did you buy GME in the first place? Hope to see more DDs instead of cultposting. Love you guys üöÄTLDR: Brief recap - fundamentals are still fun, and may be getting better. Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.\n\nI am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.\n\n**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**\n\nI think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.\n\nYou know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. \n\nNote: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.\n\n**Microsoft revenue sharing**\n\nGME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?\n\n**PC building kiosk**\n\nKnow microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:\n\n\\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently\n\n\\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get üöÄ. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.\n\n\\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.\n\nPosition GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.\n\nWhat about the squeeze?"), ("Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANT", "Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANTI like many of you work a shit job where I'm underpaid, exploited, stressed and angry. Today I found out in the coming weeks us disposable workers are about to get a shit more work, responsibility and stress going forward. After layoffs, paycuts, tightening our builts, closing offices permanently and working from home permanently I get to experience more suffering.\n\nSo that brings me to GME and the hedgefunds. I like you jumped on this movement, because that's what it is at this point, and bought one GME share because I suck and don't have the nerves of you seasoned monkeys when it comes to stocks (rip my 4 TSLA shares circa 2017). I saw what hedgefunds were trying to do and how us normal people, gamers, boyfriends, degenerates could capitalize and actually win for once in this shitty rigged system that fucks us over every day from work wages to healthcare and taxes. I was amazed at how mainstream media said fuck me when I tried to make money and was calling for bullshit regulation and peddling silver because me a guy almost 30 who has done nothing but go to college to get a worthless price of paper following the 08 crash and be told just work hard and you'll get ahead. I've been exploited by shit jobs, government who doesn't give a shit about me (hey here's two measiy still checks to compensate for another 10 years of no wage growth) and now a fucking financial system so fucking rigged that even criminals like Pablo Escobar would in awe if he were alive. Robinhood suddenly locking out of my account that has been dormant for two year, fuck you Vlad by the way, hope you go to prison. Fidelity fuck the world.\n\nSo I'm holding my 1 share. I've debated on selling to cut my losses but who the fuck cares. If this destroys a hedgefund fucking good! If I have to hold until it's worth $5 I will. These fucking banker and financial cunts need to lose and suffer like we do daily. They don't know what it's like to enyer a shit job market and be stuck in it for a fucking decade and ask for fucking tax breaks and still do illegal shit like blatantly manipularlte the free market.\n\nI've platinumed Battlefield 4 and over 30 other games.

NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)\n\nFirst, in regards to Nokia‚Äôs business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia‚Äôs current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&amp;T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. \n\n[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)\n\nNokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn‚Äôt a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won‚Äôt happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer‚Äôs where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.\n\nAt 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&amp;P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. \n\nWith that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ \n\nThe second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump‚Äôs ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don‚Äôt think this is likely. But it‚Äôs certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&amp;D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.\n\nIt should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares. \n\nForm SC 13G/A Nokia Corp. Published: 2020-02-05 12:16:19\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-20-005972/](https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-20-005972/) \n\nAnd the new one showing the increase.\n\nForm SC 13G/A Nokia Corp.

The increase is a good question. \n\nNow you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. \n\nFinal words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered.'), ('$GME, what comes next?', "$GME, what comes next?Let's establish the main opinion behind what I am going to type - GME  will not become bankrupt in the short term. If you believe GME will go  bankrupt within the next few months, then my thesis is completely  broken.\n\nThe shortsellers were betting on bankruptcy. That's why they dared to  short GME &gt;100%. If GME went bankrupt, they would get more money than  what GME was initially worth.\n\nThat's literally printing money out of thin air. But it absolutely  requires GME to become bankrupt, so that the extra shorted shares will  never ever have to be bought back.\n\nNow, if we can agree GME won't go bankrupt at this point. So what happens next?\n\nWhen the share price drops, 3 things happen:\n\n1. paper handers sell\n2. diamond handers buy\n3. short sellers must cover\n\nAs prices drop, #1 will get fewer as they sell. Since share price won't  go to 0, #3 will want to cover at the dip as much as possible. #2 will  buy in massively. At this stage, liquidity evaporates. What happens  then? MOASS.\n\nThis is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze. The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up.

Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there\'s an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.\n\nIf there\'s one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it\'s that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you\'d like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.\n\nHopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It\'s the most accessible and I\'m all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren\'t investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you\'ve already missed the "value" phase and you\'re basically banking on something that\'s hard to pin down.\n\nIt\'s a slippery basis for an investment, but it\'s made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here\'s the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won\'t get you to tendie town. That\'s trading, not investing, and trading doesn\'t work out well for most people.\n\nThe unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it\'s a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you\'re an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can\'t sell at the peak. I think it\'s all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren\'t approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you\'re like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.\n\nI\'d argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they\'re investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a "movement" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins.

The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGenerally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36.

In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07.

Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself.

Most of the mainstream media were very focused on talking about the TSLA, AAPL, and DIS yet only very briefly mention the fact he bought 20,000 shares of AB.

These calls are super safe long term plays, and require no brain power or risk for how deep in the money they are. In comparison to those three companies, he bought SHARES of AB. I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.\n\nAfter non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:\n\n1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR\n2.

It is one of the leading 3D-printing companies. Makerbot? The biggest brand in 3D Printing? Yep, Stratasys. I come from a background where 3D printing has become the absolute industry standard and we are going to see it becoming the standard in mass manufacture, too. I am speaking metal and carbon 3d-printing. Let me tell you, carbon printing is already better than part molding and every company on earth is starting to use it. I am talking car manufacturers, shipyards, small-scale prototypers, the cycling industry, the airplane industry, everyone. With SSYS you aren\'t jumping on a company that sells shovels during the gold rush. Your jumping on the company that gives everyone the chance to build their own damn shovel. Taking the bet on SSYS is not a "Next Friday" moment, you are rather looking into a growth over time chance. The beauty of this badger is: the current evaluation is under 3 billion.\n\nThe sad thing? You are too late. It is trading ~~near the ATH~~ at the highest level of the last 5 years. But hear me out, the real kicker is if you look at the charts. After the last earnings, there wasn\'t much movement. But then, during the overexposre of ARKK through TSLAs growth, someone has been buying in tranches day after day for nearly 2 months now. My theory is, institutional investors are starting to copy ARKKs investment strategy, loading up on different companies ARKK has been invested in.

This steady growth will not stay under the radar, especially not when retail starts to look at the different investments ARKK is exposed to. I think within the next three months it will add another 30-40% through institutional investors and ETFs cloning ARKK. If you look at their exposure chart, ARKK even had to reduce their amount of SSYS for it to stabilise it\'s % in the ETF: [https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys](https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys).

But it is going to steadily climb, which should give a nice return on calls and stock. If it goes down in value (which it did during the covid dip), it will still be a valuable company that will one day pop off. There is no real bagholding exposure at this price level.

Love you guys üöÄ', "GME brief recap. Why did you buy GME in the first place? Hope to see more DDs instead of cultposting. Love you guys üöÄTLDR: Brief recap - fundamentals are still fun, and may be getting better. Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.\n\nI am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.\n\n**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**\n\nI think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.\n\nYou know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. \n\nNote: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.\n\n**Microsoft revenue sharing**\n\nGME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?\n\n**PC building kiosk**\n\nKnow microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:\n\n\\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently\n\n\\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get üöÄ. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.\n\n\\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.\n\nPosition GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.\n\nWhat about the squeeze?"), ("Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANT", "Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANTI like many of you work a shit job where I'm underpaid, exploited, stressed and angry. Today I found out in the coming weeks us disposable workers are about to get a shit more work, responsibility and stress going forward. After layoffs, paycuts, tightening our builts, closing offices permanently and working from home permanently I get to experience more suffering.\n\nSo that brings me to GME and the hedgefunds. I like you jumped on this movement, because that's what it is at this point, and bought one GME share because I suck and don't have the nerves of you seasoned monkeys when it comes to stocks (rip my 4 TSLA shares circa 2017). I saw what hedgefunds were trying to do and how us normal people, gamers, boyfriends, degenerates could capitalize and actually win for once in this shitty rigged system that fucks us over every day from work wages to healthcare and taxes. I was amazed at how mainstream media said fuck me when I tried to make money and was calling for bullshit regulation and peddling silver because me a guy almost 30 who has done nothing but go to college to get a worthless price of paper following the 08 crash and be told just work hard and you'll get ahead. I've been exploited by shit jobs, government who doesn't give a shit about me (hey here's two measiy still checks to compensate for another 10 years of no wage growth) and now a fucking financial system so fucking rigged that even criminals like Pablo Escobar would in awe if he were alive. Robinhood suddenly locking out of my account that has been dormant for two year, fuck you Vlad by the way, hope you go to prison. Fidelity fuck the world.\n\nSo I'm holding my 1 share. I've debated on selling to cut my losses but who the fuck cares. If this destroys a hedgefund fucking good! If I have to hold until it's worth $5 I will. These fucking banker and financial cunts need to lose and suffer like we do daily. They don't know what it's like to enyer a shit job market and be stuck in it for a fucking decade and ask for fucking tax breaks and still do illegal shit like blatantly manipularlte the free market.\n\nI've platinumed Battlefield 4 and over 30 other games.

NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)\n\nFirst, in regards to Nokia‚Äôs business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia‚Äôs current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&amp;T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. \n\n[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)\n\nNokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn‚Äôt a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won‚Äôt happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer‚Äôs where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.\n\nAt 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&amp;P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. \n\nWith that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ \n\nThe second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump‚Äôs ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don‚Äôt think this is likely. But it‚Äôs certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&amp;D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.\n\nIt should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares. \n\nForm SC 13G/A Nokia Corp.

The increase is a good question. \n\nNow you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. \n\nFinal words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered.'), ('$GME, what comes next?', "$GME, what comes next?Let's establish the main opinion behind what I am going to type - GME  will not become bankrupt in the short term. If you believe GME will go  bankrupt within the next few months, then my thesis is completely  broken.\n\nThe shortsellers were betting on bankruptcy. That's why they dared to  short GME &gt;100%. If GME went bankrupt, they would get more money than  what GME was initially worth.\n\nThat's literally printing money out of thin air. But it absolutely  requires GME to become bankrupt, so that the extra shorted shares will  never ever have to be bought back.\n\nNow, if we can agree GME won't go bankrupt at this point. So what happens next?\n\nWhen the share price drops, 3 things happen:\n\n1. paper handers sell\n2. diamond handers buy\n3. short sellers must cover\n\nAs prices drop, #1 will get fewer as they sell. Since share price won't  go to 0, #3 will want to cover at the dip as much as possible. #2 will  buy in massively. At this stage, liquidity evaporates. What happens  then? MOASS.\n\nThis is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze. The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up. For this, we will need to trust Papa Cohen. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: 1000 GME shares,   üíéüçÜüôå"), ('Say it together with me, kiddos: I-N-V-E-S-T-I-N-G', 'Say it together with me, kiddos: I-N-V-E-S-T-I-N-GYes, this is a casino. Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there\'s an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.\n\nIf there\'s one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it\'s that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you\'d like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.\n\nHopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It\'s the most accessible and I\'m all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren\'t investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you\'ve already missed the "value" phase and you\'re basically banking on something that\'s hard to pin down.\n\nIt\'s a slippery basis for an investment, but it\'s made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here\'s the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won\'t get you to tendie town. That\'s trading, not investing, and trading doesn\'t work out well for most people.\n\nThe unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it\'s a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you\'re an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can\'t sell at the peak. I think it\'s all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren\'t approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you\'re like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.\n\nI\'d argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they\'re investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a "movement" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins. You can attach a face to it - Melvin Capital, Citadel, whatever - but it is inherently faceless.\n\nDFV didn\'t initially invest in a meme, or a movement - he invested in a (deep fucking) value proposition informed by his analysis of where Gamestop stood as a company and where it was heading. And then, as we all know, he held. And that\'s exactly what he has in common with WSB\'s other luminaries.\n\nIf you can see what the market doesn\'t yet see, put a chunk on the line that you can afford to lose, and *wait* (that\'s the important part) then you might have some juicy gain porn of your own to post in a year or two. You need conviction, though, or you\'ll just spend all your time looking at the tickers that made it big that day and move on to the next, sexier play. The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail. Maybe that\'s the part of the road you\'re on right now, but it\'s a good start.\n\nEdited for TL;DR - Know the difference between trading and investing, and try to do more of the latter.

In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07.

If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself.

I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.\n\nAfter non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:\n\n1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR\n2. He knows something I don't.\n\nSo, because I am retarded I went with number 2 and YOLO'd 30 Apr 19 45$ calls @ .50 cent strike price. I will hold these calls with diamond hands and we'll see what happens.\n\nEDIT: This is entirely speculative and could be high risk. I'm retarded so I don't know if it's high risk or not.

After 2-24 no one will doubt the future of streaming and the fast partnership with Netflix and narcos proves it. I don‚Äôt think NFLX is a bad play. I did last year and was wrong but if you look at their current path to profitability it intersects hard with Pluto tv and Viacomcbs production capacity for streaming additional content. \n\nfrom the library licensing deals to the possibility of a new Chapelle show on Netflix owned in part by viac as part of a big deal with Dave to the Pluto TV Narcos deal cited in the last earnings call we can see a huge leap forward for streaming overall based entirely on the NFLX VIAC relationship. Monetization is a long term process for some of these pieces of big content and after a period of time it will no longer add new subs like narcos. \n\nBut Pluto Tv can help with ad based monetization and no sub or sign in required.

Love you guys üöÄ', "GME brief recap. Why did you buy GME in the first place? Hope to see more DDs instead of cultposting. Love you guys üöÄTLDR: Brief recap - fundamentals are still fun, and may be getting better. Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo, MSFT deal with rev share, pc building kiosk 1.5 store, console cycle, e-commerce growth and pivot. Probably missed some. Now with free worldwide exposure.\n\nI am not trying to gatekeep whatever you guys want to post, but remember the time when people actually called GME stores to ask about pc kiosk (with recordings even)? Those type of posts are probably more useful if we want GME to moon. I think we all prefer the confirmation bias from more detailed fundamental DDs like those than posts about people holding the line. Maybe it's just me, but I would prefer people from all over the world knowing about how GME is a value play than a short squeeze play. Anyway, here's a brief recap on the 'fundamentals' to hopefully bring more fundamental DDs back.\n\n**Upgraded Ryan Chewy + Reggie Nintendo**\n\nI think we know who Ryan is. In short, Ryan grew Chewy by like, a lot, using little capital. Now Chewy competes against AMZN, etc. I don't have pets since I can't even take care of myself so I have not used Chewy, but an edge Chewy has against AMZN is apparently their customer service. All these growing Chewy means Ryan is now more experienced and has more connections than his Chewy days aka upgraded Ryan with bigger rockets.\n\nYou know who else is all about the customers? Reggie Nintendo. If you tards don't want to read, there are videos out there about Reggie and how his customer-oriented approach is pretty critical to Nintendo's success in freedom land. \n\nNote: I have seen some people saying how they did not really like GME in the past. Maybe Ryan + Reggie can change that.\n\n**Microsoft revenue sharing**\n\nGME will share revenue from all digital content: DLC, full games, microtransactions, xbox game pass, etc. This applies to both new and pre-owned systems. If someone bought the xbox at Walmart and then sold it to GME, GME would get a share of revenue on that system once it is resold. That's a pretty big deal itself, but here's a bigger implication: This is an incentive for GME to push MSFT systems. Will Sony, etc have a similar agreement with GME to mitigate this preferential treatment for xbox?\n\n**PC building kiosk**\n\nKnow microcenter? I don't, because there is not one store near me. But from other DDs, apparently to get high end pc stuffs you need to either buy them online or drive hours to a microcenter. With the spread of GME stores, it doesn't take much to see how much advantage they have. Older DDs have people literally asking GME employees about pc kiosk 1.5 store. Now imagine this:\n\n\\- All the used parts they could offer to people wanting to upgrade frequently\n\n\\- Ease of building a pc + all in one package. The thing about building a pc is you really need to make sure the parts are right for each other and right for you or risk getting ripped off. PC building kiosk means you don't have to know about ALL the specs to get a suitable pc. Combined with purchasing games, accessories, special deals for powerup members, collectibles, third party exclusives, etc all in one application or location for sYnErGy and you get üöÄ. Why go elsewhere when you can have everything in one place? Best part is you don't even need to build it yourself. Someone else can eat that thermal paste for you. Worry about bending a CPU pin? Not really your problem at the pc kiosk.\n\n\\-  Want further synergy? Logistical advantage with having a store near you and knowing what's popular. With the right data, they may really cut down on the waiting times for a buyer on popular parts if not outright branded as 'never out of stock'.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGME's turnaround story has not changed. GME just got an added worldwide exposure. Is $500 a fair valuation based on fundamentals alone? Maybe not, but with the focus on digital growth, it wouldn't surprise me if GME gets a tech-like valuation. Like one of our favorite analysts once said, GME is a disruptive EV company after all. Anyway, I got lazy and left out lots of other good stuff. If you want more, just look into older DDs. The sources are in those, too.\n\nPosition GME @ $30+. Never sold. Also holding some CRSR.\n\nWhat about the squeeze?"), ("Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANT", "Today I'd like to say fuck you to the hedgefunds from an exploited working stiff RANTI like many of you work a shit job where I'm underpaid, exploited, stressed and angry. Today I found out in the coming weeks us disposable workers are about to get a shit more work, responsibility and stress going forward. After layoffs, paycuts, tightening our builts, closing offices permanently and working from home permanently I get to experience more suffering.\n\nSo that brings me to GME and the hedgefunds. I like you jumped on this movement, because that's what it is at this point, and bought one GME share because I suck and don't have the nerves of you seasoned monkeys when it comes to stocks (rip my 4 TSLA shares circa 2017). I saw what hedgefunds were trying to do and how us normal people, gamers, boyfriends, degenerates could capitalize and actually win for once in this shitty rigged system that fucks us over every day from work wages to healthcare and taxes. I was amazed at how mainstream media said fuck me when I tried to make money and was calling for bullshit regulation and peddling silver because me a guy almost 30 who has done nothing but go to college to get a worthless price of paper following the 08 crash and be told just work hard and you'll get ahead.

Robinhood suddenly locking out of my account that has been dormant for two year, fuck you Vlad by the way, hope you go to prison. Fidelity fuck the world.\n\nSo I'm holding my 1 share. I've debated on selling to cut my losses but who the fuck cares. If this destroys a hedgefund fucking good! If I have to hold until it's worth $5 I will. These fucking banker and financial cunts need to lose and suffer like we do daily. They don't know what it's like to enyer a shit job market and be stuck in it for a fucking decade and ask for fucking tax breaks and still do illegal shit like blatantly manipularlte the free market.\n\nI've platinumed Battlefield 4 and over 30 other games.

NASA selected Nokia exclusively to build the first cellular network on the moon. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/20/talking-on-the-moon-nasa-and-nokia-to-install-4g-on-lunar-surface)\n\nFirst, in regards to Nokia‚Äôs business. Nokia, unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt manufacturer phones anymore. Nokia sold the right to produce Nokia branded phones to HMD Global while retaining the right to have some input. Nokia‚Äôs current business concentrates on mobile networks such as 5G, network infrastructures, and cloud services. In other words, Nokia business pertains to the most basic component of our modern civilization. Especially so the Post-COVID world where networking is even more important than before. Think of the Tesla cars. They are connected to AT&amp;T cellular networks which are built by Nokia. Nokia will be leading the networks that would eventually enable automation. And when that happens, Nokia will have a continuous revenue stream. \n\n[https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20201022/channels/news/att-verizon-nokia-offer-private-lte-5g)\n\nNokia is leading mobile networks with 27% of the world (excluding China) market share of 4G and 5G. It currently holds more than 3000k patents for 5G. Nokia other major competitors are Ericson, Huawei, and ZTE. Some countries of the Western hemisphere and the G7 banned Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE from operating in their countries. I suspect this will continue in the future. Leaving us with only Nokia and Ericson. But couldn‚Äôt a Mega-Cap such as Google or Tesla somehow eliminate NOK and ERIC? NOK holds more than 3000 patents already. So there is a strong barrier of entry into such a business. That won‚Äôt happen unless Nokia licences a patent for such a company. In this hypothetical scenario, the Mega-Cap would have to acquire Nokia. Which in turn will raise the price of the stock. I think this is the case that is similar to MSFT under Ballmer‚Äôs where the stock price was stagnant for many years. But slowly surged under Nadella. Though given the catalyst of COVID-19, I think the surge will happen quicker with NOK.\n\nAt 4.53 a share. NOK P/E ratio is 30.81x. Which is a small discount in comparison with the S&amp;P 500 which has P/E ration of about 39x. This establishes Nokia not only as a growth stock but also as a value stock. The lowest that NOK dropped to was 2.34. Which happened back in March. At the current price, I believe that NOK is well within the margin of safety. \n\nWith that being said, there are some problems that should be addressed. The income trend in the past few years is problematic. But this can offset by the fact that NOK has contracts well into the future with many nations states and private companies that should generate ample income until NOK is able to eliminate Huawei and ZTE and in turn, dominate the market (With Ericson). Also, Nokia is spening billions on research \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-proximus/nokia-wins-5g-contract-from-proximus-luxembourg-idUSKBN28P0WJ \n\nThe second complication is that Biden or other G7 leaders could potentially reverse Trump‚Äôs ousting of Huawei and ZTE. I don‚Äôt think this is likely. But it‚Äôs certainly a possibility. But even if it happens. Nokia will still have a big market share. And 100% market share of the moon and will always have a priority over Huawei and ZTE for government projects for reasons of national security. Also, there is a substantial amount of money spent on R&amp;D which will I believe will be a catalyst in the future surge in NOK.\n\nIt should be worth noting that just one day after RH banned NOK, Blackrock released an amendment to their ownership of NOK. Increasing their shares by  21,140,777 shares. \n\nForm SC 13G/A Nokia Corp.

The increase is a good question. \n\nNow you might ask me why not Ericson? ERIC is also a good stock. But I see more value in NOK. Also, the fact the NOK is working on 1 Terabit per second internet, and that it will bring 4G to the moon, and the fact that Nokia is #1 by patterns give it an edge in innovative growth. \n\nFinal words: GME to the moon and pigs get slaughtered.'), ('$GME, what comes next?', "$GME, what comes next?Let's establish the main opinion behind what I am going to type - GME  will not become bankrupt in the short term. If you believe GME will go  bankrupt within the next few months, then my thesis is completely  broken.\n\nThe shortsellers were betting on bankruptcy. That's why they dared to  short GME &gt;100%. If GME went bankrupt, they would get more money than  what GME was initially worth.\n\nThat's literally printing money out of thin air. But it absolutely  requires GME to become bankrupt, so that the extra shorted shares will  never ever have to be bought back.\n\nNow, if we can agree GME won't go bankrupt at this point. So what happens next?\n\nWhen the share price drops, 3 things happen:\n\n1. paper handers sell\n2. diamond handers buy\n3. short sellers must cover\n\nAs prices drop, #1 will get fewer as they sell. Since share price won't  go to 0, #3 will want to cover at the dip as much as possible. #2 will  buy in massively. At this stage, liquidity evaporates. What happens  then? MOASS.\n\nThis is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze. The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up.

Yes, the glories of WSB have been built on the charred corpses of untold retards who diamond-handed weeklies until the bitter end, and the few who climbed atop the fray to reach Valhalla. But there\'s an inconvenient reality that calls into question the mythology of WSB, which is that many of our most storied figures are, beyond the memes and rocket emojis, investors, rather than gamblers or their slightly more couth bretheren, traders.\n\nIf there\'s one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it\'s that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you\'d like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.\n\nHopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It\'s the most accessible and I\'m all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren\'t investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you\'ve already missed the "value" phase and you\'re basically banking on something that\'s hard to pin down.\n\nIt\'s a slippery basis for an investment, but it\'s made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here\'s the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won\'t get you to tendie town. That\'s trading, not investing, and trading doesn\'t work out well for most people.\n\nThe unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it\'s a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you\'re an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can\'t sell at the peak. I think it\'s all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren\'t approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you\'re like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.\n\nI\'d argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they\'re investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a "movement" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins.

The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail.

Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the apes / autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap. It's the share price \\* outstanding shares (not just float shares).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGME Market Cap (Valuation) at $300/share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b ($300 \\* 69.75M shares).  The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGenerally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36. Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) which is an in-person salon retail has a wopping 72.42 valuation with an annual consensus of $3.94 EPS. Source: [https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry\\_Valuation.php?s=1300](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1300).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it. In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄNow, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations.

I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.\n\nAfter non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:\n\n1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR\n2.

Because they were so in the money I would have had to pay massive short term capital gains taxes. \n- when did you buy the contracts? 9-12 months ago. \n- do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it‚Äôs my biggest holding. It‚Äôs the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world‚Äôs most valuable company before the end of the decade. \n- will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn. \n- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. \n- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don‚Äôt give financial advice. Read my post history to see what I‚Äôm buying and decide if you like any of the ideas. \n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nTo all the dudes Messaging me: follow me if you want to know my next play. I‚Äôm not going to Message it to the 250+ people who messaged me tonight. \n\nTo all the ladies sliding into my messages: thanks for the kind notes.

Remember Apes: alone weak, together strong (AMC proposal)', 'rWSB is losing direction and becoming fractured. Remember Apes: alone weak, together strong (AMC proposal)First, what do I mean by losing direction and becoming fractured. Before the whole GME explosion and influx of subscribers, there was pretty much one theme on the subreddit: make huge gains or go down trying. **When the GME proposal came up, everyone was pretty much in sync to make huge gains or go down trying.** Now the subreddit has been split by a variety of different camps:\n\n\\- The OG WSB crew\n\n\\- The fresh first time investors looking to start big\n\n\\- New lurkers/spectators checking out the show\n\n\\- Seasoned investors looking to pick up the next big stock\n\n\\- Corporate accounts/bots looking to astro turf\n\n**You\'d think that with more people, WSB would grow as a force, but the problem is so many people are split:**\n\n\\- Some people are holding/buying GME for another explosion\n\n\\- Some people are holding/buying AMC, BB, NOK, etc.\n\n\\- Some people are selling because they CAN\'T or SHOULDN\'T be making any more losses (totally fine)\n\n\\- Some people are selling because they just want to go back to other stocks (totally fine)\n\n\\- Some assholes are selling/buying puts and then laughing at anyone buying/holding GME, BB, etc.\n\n**Whatever the "right" move is, I think it\'s important to remember and to let new people know that the core of the WSB has been and should continue to be: make huge gains or go down trying\\***\n\nIf you made money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then congrats! But if you made money and then came here to call others idiots, then get lost\n\nIf you lost money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then I\'m sorry. But if you lost money and then came here to insult people who didn\'t/couldn\'t want to buy/hold, then get lost\n\n**Regardless of the Gamestop event, this sub has and will continue to make huge gains and huge losses. It happened last year during the pandemic. It happened two years ago with tech (AMD anyone). It WILL continue to happen. Embrace the swings and don\'t put others down**\n\nAs for the proposal:\n\nBefore people, I\'m not calling for people to sell GME. While I\'m skeptical GME can rise to $300 again or sustain mid $60s, I\'m more than happy to be proven wrong and screw the cheating hedge funds. So if you\'re holding/buying for those diamond hands, more power to you\n\n**What I am suggesting is that new/returning people on the subreddit look at investing in AMC.** I think focusing on AMC is the right call because:\n\n\\- The stock is pretty cheap in comparison to GME. It\'s simply easier to have everyone join in a mid $7 amc stock versus a mid $60 Gamestop stock. NO APE LEFT BEHIND\n\n\\- The stock does still have significant volatility to make huge swings. Compared to Nokia for example, AMC has the potential to rise significantly in a short amount of time\n\n\\- The company itself is on the upside and people are getting optimistic that the stock could naturally reach $20 long term without the help of this subreddit (theaters opening up, vaccine rollouts, etc.). Meanwhile, rallying people to Gamestop is a tough sell when Gamestop probably won\'t maintain $60+ value in the long term (again, happy to be wrong here)\n\n\\- It\'s received a bunch of coverage. It\'s simply easier to get people informed compared to some random stock\n\n\\- The argument could be made that there\'s still value to be made off of a short squeeze\n\nIn short, **I\'m proposing AMC as a stock with potential to get everyone on the same page, but any low priced stock with potential would work (as long as the subreddit is united). We have a bunch of new people and attention now. Let\'s not waste it by tearing each other down or splitting into various factions**\n\n**TLDR: in bold**\n\n\\* It\'s important to note that you should always make huge gains or go down trying within reason. NEVER invest money that you are not prepared to lose. NEVER put yourself at risk of bankruptcy or depression\n\nEdit:\n\nJust wanted to clarify a few things:\n\n\\- The divide in the community I\'m talking about is with users of this sub insulting one another based on their stock positions. There are examples of people insulting me in this thread itself that prove my point. **Don\'t let money turn you into an asshole**\n\n\\- **The AMC recommendation is just that. A recommendation**. The same way people hyped up Tesla on this sub, I see potential in that stock and it\'s cheap so that\'s why I\'m recommending it to new people over GME, but I\'m just an ape so what do I know ¬Ø\\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\\_/¬Ø\n\n\\- **To people thinking that I\'m desperately trying to bump up the value of my positions: no**. If I really wanted to make money, I\'d be on r/stocks not here playing it risky. As someone that works in software, the couple hundred that I invested is not gonna make or break me, so losing it is fine with me.

But still, thanks to you guys, managed to lose at least 1500!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut seriously, thanks! Because for a measly 1500 greenbacks, as someone who has never, ever invested I learned:\n\n\n- how to use a trading platform\n- how to read critically\n- how to place limit orders and not market orders \n- how basic options works\n- how to navigate insane amounts of hype, stupidity, and propaganda (the SLVR, BB, NOK pushers, which were always obvious targeted distractions\n- how little power I have\n- how even less knowledge I have.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo here are a few lessons (which I\'m still learning) which I‚Äôd like to share with y\'all.\n\n1. **Be critical of everything** - There are not only a lot of shills and bots out there (I‚Äôm looking at you, $SLVR-pushers!) but there are, surprise surprise even more autists. Especially with 6 million new accounts of presumably people who have never invested in their live, but in classic Internet-style, already tout themselves as steel-balled market gurus. From people posting data that‚Äôs [fundamentally wrong] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcds9k/short_interest_is_226_per_finra_do_not_sell/glz8xq8/?context=3), fundamentally misinterpreted, or coming to conclusions without enough data or just plain old confirmation bias (basically, all of WSB). Special shoutout to [u/smohyee\'s] (https://www.reddit.com/user/smohyee) very [sober post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/) which helped me look critically at stuff that has been flying around the forum these last days.\n\n2. **Don‚Äôt underestimate my ignorance** - I know nothing. Literally nothing. I can do basic addition and subtraction, and know stocks go up and down. Personally, the market seems like a huge insane bubble ready to burst at any second. But maybe not. What do I know? ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm as autistic as you. ü§§\n\n3. **Get in before the hype** - Even to my stupid, ignorant self, I realized buying GME at an all-time high of 150X its low, was a stupid idea. Especially when the entire Internet and even non-Internet media was buzzing with the hype. *3B. (Corollary). - If you are going to go up against a Hedge fund with is 10000X more powerful than you, don‚Äôt announce all your moves up front.* \n \n4. **Understand what the statistics and metrics mean before betting (I mean: "investing")** - People are posting volume data, short interest numbers, using fancy lingo and stats that I still can‚Äôt wrap my brain around (I still haven‚Äôt understood how you can sell a put you don‚Äôt have for example, that‚Äôs how ignorant I am). But, as the wise men &amp; women say - ignorance is an opportunity to redeem yourself.\n\n5. **Don‚Äôt underestimate all the other players** - Hedge funds, Retirement funds. Whales. They all have different agendas. And their agendas are not yours. The worst mistakes I saw were not acknowledging the special advantages that institutional investors will always have. This is not *cheating*. This is how the market works. You can be a crybaby autist about it, but that‚Äôs how it is (I wrote a bit about some of the advantages even I saw that HF have [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbifwv/a_skeptics_post_can_wsb_win_the_gme_standoff_even/) - me, who knows nothing about investing). Institutional Investors have sentiment trackers, high-speed algorithms, inside information, battle-hardened experience, tricky tactics, etc. You are not going to beat any Hedge Fund of Institutional Investor at a game they invented, made the rules in, and excel at.\n\n6. **Expertise is valuable** - There is a very good reason why finance jobs, especially at Investment Banks, Hedge Funds and Private Equity firms are the best-paid jobs in the world - because they places hire very fucking smart people, who work very fucking hard (7 days a week, 14-hour days), to be better at this than you or I. The expectation that we be as good as them, is like expecting to pop out of your mom‚Äôs womb and run a 100m faster than Usain Bolt without a day‚Äôs training. The reason we don‚Äôt like Hedge Funds or the stock market in general, is it is because it a casino for the wealthy. We are the poor schlubs sitting at the 1 dollar blackjack table, while watching the billionaires in their Tuxedos coming out of their Bentley‚Äôs to play at the million dollar poker tables. From a recent Economist article this week: *‚ÄúEven in America stock market gains have mainly accrued to the rich. The wealthiest 1% owns 56% of the stock market, up from 46% in 1990; the top 10% owns 88% of the market.‚Äù*\n\n7. **The HF didn‚Äôt cheat. They don\'t need to. They hustled** - They invited ignorant newbies to sit at their tables (yes, that‚Äôs us), and then fleeced us of our cash. We are idiots, because we KNEW the hustle was coming and we KNEW the pros were pros, and yet we STILL played against them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Little reminders for myself for next time:**\n\n1. **Accept the risk** - Any money I gamble in this friggin casino I can count as lost.\n2. **If you have no clue, don‚Äôt bet** - I have no clue what a ‚ÄúCalendar Call‚Äù or a ‚ÄúVertical Call‚Äù is. You can bet I won‚Äôt be making that, until I do.\n3. **Losing (preferably a little bit) of money, is a very strong motivation to learn.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd a li‚Äô tip for my fellow autists:\n\n**Don‚Äôt post fucking DDs if you are an ignorant shit.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPositions - Holding 215 AMC (115 bought  (stupidly, and during the hype) @14; 100 bought during a dip @ 8.11)\nHolding 2 GME (1 free from RH, 1 bought at 115)\n1 SPY put 332; EXP 03/31\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFinal final note (for real, this time):\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***If you think the stock market is unfair, you are right.

Like many of you, I was looking forward to the short squeeze as I bought into AMC the night before Robinhood restricted shares and we didn\'t ride the rocket to the moon together. I thought some of you may need some reassurance if the squeeze doesn\'t happen today, tomorrow, next week, or even in two weeks. I tried to piece all the information I could together in as logical of a manner as I could and feel free to correct me where you think I\'m wrong or add onto my thoughts.\n\nAfter I read through the Elon Musk tweet thread where he autistically said, "I am become meme, Destroyer of shorts" I realized that TSLA was probably diamond handed by a bunch of you apes and I wanted to confirm so I did some browsing and came upon this article. ( https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1mzy62nf393lw/The-Longest-Unprofitable-Short-I-ve-Ever-Seen ). I realized that TESLA in no way, shape, or form should ever be a stock worth over  $800 dollars because their revenue per year is only 20 billion and they produce 500,000 cars with a market cap of  $800 billion per year compared to say Toyota who posts revenue of 272 billion and yet have a market cap of a measly $185.4 billion. It is simply the result of a company that is performing well and is still squeezing shorts to this very day. \n\nShort selling is when a share is borrowed at market price (at whatever time it was borrowed) so they can sell the share at that price, and then cover the borrowed share when the price of the stock decreases so they can profit the difference. If we were to look at the chart of AMC\'s (the stock I\'m diamond handing) Hedge funds must have short sold it at no lower than  $4 dollars because since the beginning of 2020, the stock had "peaks of around  $7.50 in Feb 2020,  $6.50 in June 2020, and  $4.30 in Nov 2020. In order to capitalize of short selling, they would try to buy in at the highest price possible in order to profit the most when they anticipate COVID would crash the price of AMC and potentially attack AMC enough to bankrupt them. Unfortunately, we love AMC. We\'ve enjoyed movies since our childhoods at AMC theaters, had our first dates there, enjoyed time with friends and family bonding together in AMCs. The support of this community and many others willing to keep AMC afloat through this tumultuous COVID crisis kept AMC alive and their stock price MUCH higher than intended for the short sellers. The only website that shows me short interest from 2/3/2021 is ( https://www.thestreet.com/investing/top-stocks-being-shorted-by-short-interest-gamestop-gogo ) and GME and AMC\'s short interest are both very high. If you guys have more data I\'d love to see it. \n\nUnfortunately right now with the SEC investigation of DFV, social media, and message boards such as WSB. Our interest in GME and AMC as an undervalued stock can\'t be shared as heavily with others because its thought of as market manipulation. After the investigation clears and DFV can return, and perhaps more public figures can come in such as Mark Cuban, Elon Musk, Chamath Palihapitiya, we can spread our DD for these companies that we know are highly undervalued.\n\n\nSimply put, if we hold our shares, and AMC re-opens and starts to reflect its true value as a 15-16 dollar stock. The squeeze will occur from the shorts and they either can exit their position or they will continue to try to short and just keep running up their tab. In the end if shorts get squeezed, its just a transfer of capital from one to the next because a hedge fund bet on a company failing. \n\ntl;dr I like the stock and my hands are diamonds until I die\n\nI own 560 shares at $14.09 AMC'), ('Does this mean we are running out of paper hands?', "Does this mean we are running out of paper hands?I have been looking at the level II data for GME today and once in a while you see the order book empty on both the buy and sell side.

My biased holding ape brain tells me that there is not a lot of volume and people don't want to sell after a price, but then it could also mean that the orders are just not coming in fast enough for updates. Could any of you woke saints throw some light on it?

Since silver does have industrial uses, in the future these industrial demands will be difficult to meet.

So silver is also a solar energy play. With Biden taking office, we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil.\n\nPhotovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels.

As such, Silver production is in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart for you](https://preview.redd.it/jd7j4f5tpgf61.png?width=1314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf89b396074924c03685e65bcb4ae1556f7c90e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to conclude the boomer DD:\n\n\\- Inflation is on the rise\n\n\\- Too much money is being printed\n\n\\- Silver outperforms gold\n\n\\- Silver biggest use is industrial use\n\n\\- Silver demand is increasing\n\n\\- Silver supply is dropping\n\n**WSB DD üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to [coingape.com](https://coingape.com) , in order to pull short squeeze of hedge funds (not necessarily JP Morgan), we would need silver to go to $500\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Some tweet they put on their site idk üöÄüöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/6dej6iowpgf61.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33a578db6f235c5e14b7d420637ce7936838b6d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, I am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver ( Hello SEC! )\n\nI\'m just saying that I really like SLV stock, and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons. There is also an additional upside of the fact that IF for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely. This is because unlike the GME short squeeze, where GME can issue new stock, a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver, because silver cannot be printed.\n\nAlso, we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the GME short squeeze. Robinhood restricting bought GME shares, brokers being gay etc etc. The difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy, and all the new people who just joined WSB in the daily discussion thread going "Hey guys i\'m a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can I buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you" can also join in. If a short squeeze were to happen, this is how it would happen.\n\n1. People buy SLV stock (not random ETF\'s because they don\'t buy physical silver)\n2. Silver price go up\n3. JP Morgan ANGRY\n4. Robinhood and other brokers experience "temporary outages", "Buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason" , "Limiting SLV shares that can be bought"\n5. WSB and noobs who don\'t know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins. Or since we are in a pandemic order it off eBay or something\n\nBasically, the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way.\n\nWhether or not large banks like JP Morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because it\'s heavily debated and I don\'t know the answer, but what we can CONFIRM is that HEDGE FUNDS are short on silver.\n\nMaybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rebuttals against the bullish case on silver**\n\nI have been drafting this message for a while, and at the same time have skimmed a few anti-silver posts. The common points against this is\n\n\\- One contract is too expensive\n\n\\- People who don\'t know how to trade futures will get stuck with it\n\n\\- Its taking attention away from GME\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*One contract is too expensive*\n\nThe contracts you are referring to are the futures, aka paper silver. There are three ways to buy physical silver\n\n1. But silver futures and take delivery\n2. Buy SLV shares\n3. Buy Silver from jewellers or online sellers\n\nThere are currently around 5 times more contracts for silver in the COMEX markets than there is supply of it. This means that when you buy SLV futures and exercise it, the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who DOES have it. Once we do this, they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market. Companies like TSLA, Samsung and Canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile, because they know that supply is dwindling. People have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too, if you don\'t believe me check for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*People who don\'t know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees*\n\nSee above\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Its taking attention away from GME*\n\nI am not being paid by anyone to write this, i just genuinely see the potential for it. While I do agree that GME is still relevant, it doesn\'t mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios. We shouldn\'t miss out on silver just because we are still in GME. Besides, a SLV squeeze would be much more beneficial than the GME squeeze because of my last point below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Last and most important point - the benefit of a silver price rise**\n\n**When GME prices go up, who benefits? Shareholders, hedge funds who are long GME, banks, etc**\n\n**When BITCOIN moons, who benefits? Banks, rich people, people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it, people who have access to bitcoin wallets, brokers etc.**\n\n**When we blow up stocks like GME and BTC, even though we profit, and even if we bankrupt hedge funds, the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own GME stock.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BUT WHO OWNS SILVER?**\n\nAlmost every household owns some silver. Whether its\' bars, coins, or religious statues. Poorer countries and places, like Asia and Africa, most households have a small silver chain, a family heirloom, ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket I don\'t know.\n\nIf silver prices moon, money goes to the people, even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver, silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of. If we can get silver back to its FAIR VALUE, through the reasons and HYPOTHETICAL methods I mentioned above, we can not only burn hedge funds, profit for ourselves, but also help poor families.\n\nPoor people don\'t how to set up a brokerage account and buy Gamestonk. Poor people don\'t know how to trade cryptocurrencies. Poor people don\'t have the capital to enter into the stock market. What they DO have is gold and silver (mainly silver).  When they don\'t have the knowledge or ability to buy shares (As proven with the recent influx of people with "What is a broker" kind of questions), they get left out of these massive wealth transfers. Its much easier to say "Buy silver lol" than "Ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs, verify all your information, deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose...."\n\nIf you want to bankrupt hedge funds, don\'t transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long GME. Instead, transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families.\n\nTLDR WSB DD: If silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you. Also silver buying cannot be restricted because you don\'t need a broker to buy silver. (IF YOU ARE READING THIS DITCH ROBINHOOD AND CHANGE BROKERS. IF YOU DON\'T CHANGE BROKRS THEY WILL KEEP DOING THINGS LIKE THIS \\[When you don\'t pay for a product you ARE the product\\])\n\nRegardless or whether or not we take part, silver will get to its fair value. Although it would be faster if we joined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStocks I like: SLV\n\nStocks I DO NOT LIKE: silver ETF\'s that have paper silver positions\n\nIf you have questions, counterpoints, suggestions or edits message me u/Prestigious_West_524'), ('GME long term rebound potential - the most entertaining outcome', 'GME long term rebound potential - the most entertaining outcome\n"The most entertaining outcome is the most likely." - Papa Musk\n\nThis is not financial advice, I just made this up with my primitive ape brain. This analysis is not based on any financial wisdom and you should always do your own diligence and research for any personal financial decisions.\n\nI am basing my analysis on a theory based on the quote above by one of my favorite guys Elon Musk. So what long term outcome is the most entertaining in this case? How about TSLA decides to buy a heavy portion of GameStop? Sounds crazy? Good, let\'s see where this goes. This is what I\'m dubbing the "Planet of the Apes" theory.\n\nThe case for why TSLA can and should acquire GameStop to make a lot of money.\n\nLong Rant:\nSo there are two conflicting realities right now, retarded geniuses have crippled big hedge funds while not really doing any damage, they got really rich while losing it all. Gamestop is a worthless company that is actually fundamentally able to pay their bills, has locations all over the country and unlimited loyalty and PR from a massive online fanbase through a once in a lifetime event like this. The price shouldn\'t be so high but we need to restrict buying volume to deflate the momentum. The shorts have already covered their positions while also doubling down and digging themselves deeper.\n\nOne of these realities will become true at some point soon. You may have already made up your mind but I\'m still holding and waiting. I\'m not a fanboy, I\'ve made risky moves before. Actually read headlines about companies that I had thousands in announce bankruptcy and get delisted. With diversification your gains are still more likely to outweigh your losses in the LONG RUN. Meaning investment doesn\'t happen over the course of days but rather weeks, months, or even years.üíéüíé‚úä‚úä \n\nWe all know Musk is a visionary who is unafraid to enter a new, risky venture. He\'s done it all, payment platforms, electric cars, outer space, even UNDERGROUND! The man is the the king of chasing big ideas in unlikely markets and that\'s why he\'s so cool. He makes EV-ATVs and flamethrowers for fun. And he hasn\'t been shy about supporting us during this time. I think it\'s fair to say he likes the stock.\n\nNow let\'s compare TSLA and GME. TSLA has a $800 BILLION market cap. GME has a $4.7 BILLION market cap, currently down from over $20 Billion a few days ago. So they could be bought right now at a 20% discount from their all time high. Now, I\'m more retarded than most apes, but to me, that sounds like a pretty good deal for an opportunity to turn around GME by logically pivoting to e-commerce, e-sports, cloud gaming and start to compete with Microsoft and Sony and every other big name in this massive market space, while gaining a massive amount of customer loyalty and support for their other products. This would further diversify TSLAs revenue sources and allow for a lot of really fun marketing opportunities like Tesla racing video game, or console for example.\n\nNow of course, this is fiction. I made it up. But let me tell you a retarded reason why that doesn\'t matter. This is a real thing that happened to me a while ago and no amount of doubting from anyone will change this totally real experience I had. Here goes, I was sitting in a taco bell and I ordered a $2 meal deal for my broke ass which was an awesome deal because you got a 5 layer burrito, a drink, and a bag of Doritos. And as I was sitting there in my favorite restaurant, admiring the genius that came up with Baja blast mountain dew, and how genius ideas like that are worth millions. And as I was eating a Dorito I realized, this is just a taco shell, broken into a small triangle, with Dorito powder. They should just partner and make a Dorito taco, people will go crazy for it. And then I immediately went about my life as normal. Over a year later Taco Bell announced the Dorito loco taco and completely saved the company with that one idea that I had and never shared with anybody.\n\nWhat does any of this mean? I have the power to make up crazy things and they actually come true on at least one or two occasions in the past. \n\nTLDR: I like the stock. I like Elon and I think he likes the stock too. TSLA buying GME potentially means big gains for everyone and is the most entertaining possibility which makes it the most likely. I\'m actually a savaant as proven by my totally real taco bell story. Holding GME 25 shares avg cost $198. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåïüåñüåóüåòüåëüåíüåìüåîüåï'), ('I bought above 200 and I am not fking sell, but there is one more important thing', "I bought above 200 and I am not fking sell, but there is one more important thingI was pretty lucky cause I entered the market as a retail trader 7,8 years ago (who only buy stuff like spy, qqq, amazon etc), so I didn't really have any experiences with 2008 crisis.

FUCK YOU.\n\nLOOK AT  THE PPL SPENDING THEIR TENDIES TO GIVE BACK.  It\'s our $, let us do what  we want with it.  If a hedgie can irresponsibly short a stock over  100%, why can\'t we take a CALCULATED risk?  BUUUT funDamentAls.   Gamestop is a dying company.  The former business model of GME is dying.   As most physical businesses are.  See 24 hour fitness.  (I\'ve never  been inside a gym but I read stuff online)  But GME is pivoting.  PAPA  COWEN and the new board members are pivoting to e-commerce.  He\'s  assembling the fucking avengers to the END GAME but this is just getting  started.  GME is transforming just like Netflix when it went from DVDs  to online streaming.  We are the ugly duckling that gets super sexy  after growing pains.\n\nHow about  this for fuuunDamentAls.  Hedge funds being allowed to short a stock  over 100% and nobody comments on how that happened.  Why it happened.   And how SHORTING has INFINITE room to lose.  Keep in mind, they are  sophisticated gamblers with other people\'s money and 401ks.  BUT  according to their calculation it\'s little to no risk.  Because they can  throw more $ at the problem and manipulate the market, they can fix it!   If they can\'t, they want to cry to the media, get the public opinion  on their side, and ask for MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  Why would a  greedy $ machine ask for more oversight?  OH, that\'s because the SEC is  your lapdog and the government will bail you out with tax payer dollars.   SEE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  Yet, we are not allowed to exploit the law  of supply and demand.  If the demand exceeds 100% of the supply, the  inherit value ROCKETS.  See RTX cards and AMD chips.  FUCK SCALPERS for  good measure :)\n\nI want to remind  every single one of you, we do matter.  We have NUMBERS on our side.  As  a collective we\'ve already made shorting a topic of conversation at the  political level.  This may not be a monetary victory but it hopefully  is a step in the right direction to a more equal game.  That or hold  your politicians accountable.  You are their constituents.\n\nWe  play out in the open.  We share publicly available information and make  decisions base.  Really, it\'s just autistic people posting the exact  confirmation biases that we needed to see.  It prints $$$$ BRRrrrrr.\n\nLet\'s recap how the odds are stacked against us.\n\n\\-We  are too stupid to be allowed to spend our money.  We need government  intervention to "protect us".  The little guys, the plebes, the  unsophisticated, etc..  Yet they can\'t decide on how/when to get a  stimmy check to us.  THEY REALLY REALLY CARE (when hedge funds lose  money).  We some how took wallstreet down with $600.  If the stock  market was that fragile, we have BIGGER issues.\n\n\\-Momentum  was killed last week by brokers being held to new collateral  requirements by clearing houses.  Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they\'re  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn\'t  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.\n\n\\-News outlet and controlling the narrative.  How many analysts, journalist, and their rich ~~daddies~~  overlords are framing this as WSB pumping and dumping a meme stock.  WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?  You deplorable sacks of shit who get no enjoyment out of life  other than sucking the souls and money out of people.  You live to see  more zeros in your account and there is a special place in hell for you.\n\n\\-SEC  holding a meeting tonight investigating market manipulation through  social media but no investigative statement on how clearing houses can  magically conjure a rule that halts trading for retail investors.   Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they\'re not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.\n\n\\-How  shorts magically covered their positions but DO NOT have to report their  positions until weeks later.  Lack of immediate transparency gives them  ample time to reposition and multiple options to cover their asses  while blaming us.\n\nAnyways, I could  keep bitching but I just wanted to vent and rally us together.  We took  a mad beating. I just wanted to let you beautiful online strangers that  you aren\'t alone.  GME has transcended and has evolved into a movement.\n\nWhat  does GME mean to me?  A down-payment to a home for my family and I.  My  wife and I are expecting our first kid.  I\'m risking something I can  lose... for a better future.\n\nWhat does GME mean to you?\n\nTLDR; We fucking matter.  We are going to be the catalyst of change. HOLD SHARES.

But for a core position, Ford isn\'t bad.\n\n**It\'s a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.\n\nIf you want to talk fundamentals, PE is something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass, putting it into small bags and selling it for 79c/lb for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.\n\nIf you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don\'t care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.\n\n**Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden\'s "plan" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that\'s what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. Yes GM will probably do the same thing, but GM doesn\'t have this next point which changes the situation.\n\n**So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it\'s never going to happen. I would never buy a phone from Ford for example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.\n\nGM does not have this. GM does not have anyone to prostitute their driver data to. Sure, GM can do that, but GM is expensive and their small cars business will be absolutely killed by the deluge of new small EV manufacturers over the years.\n\nSo... don\'t do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon).

Before the whole GME explosion and influx of subscribers, there was pretty much one theme on the subreddit: make huge gains or go down trying. **When the GME proposal came up, everyone was pretty much in sync to make huge gains or go down trying.** Now the subreddit has been split by a variety of different camps:\n\n\\- The OG WSB crew\n\n\\- The fresh first time investors looking to start big\n\n\\- New lurkers/spectators checking out the show\n\n\\- Seasoned investors looking to pick up the next big stock\n\n\\- Corporate accounts/bots looking to astro turf\n\n**You\'d think that with more people, WSB would grow as a force, but the problem is so many people are split:**\n\n\\- Some people are holding/buying GME for another explosion\n\n\\- Some people are holding/buying AMC, BB, NOK, etc.\n\n\\- Some people are selling because they CAN\'T or SHOULDN\'T be making any more losses (totally fine)\n\n\\- Some people are selling because they just want to go back to other stocks (totally fine)\n\n\\- Some assholes are selling/buying puts and then laughing at anyone buying/holding GME, BB, etc.\n\n**Whatever the "right" move is, I think it\'s important to remember and to let new people know that the core of the WSB has been and should continue to be: make huge gains or go down trying\\***\n\nIf you made money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then congrats! But if you made money and then came here to call others idiots, then get lost\n\nIf you lost money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then I\'m sorry. But if you lost money and then came here to insult people who didn\'t/couldn\'t want to buy/hold, then get lost\n\n**Regardless of the Gamestop event, this sub has and will continue to make huge gains and huge losses. It happened last year during the pandemic. It happened two years ago with tech (AMD anyone). It WILL continue to happen. Embrace the swings and don\'t put others down**\n\nAs for the proposal:\n\nBefore people, I\'m not calling for people to sell GME. While I\'m skeptical GME can rise to $300 again or sustain mid $60s, I\'m more than happy to be proven wrong and screw the cheating hedge funds. So if you\'re holding/buying for those diamond hands, more power to you\n\n**What I am suggesting is that new/returning people on the subreddit look at investing in AMC.** I think focusing on AMC is the right call because:\n\n\\- The stock is pretty cheap in comparison to GME. It\'s simply easier to have everyone join in a mid $7 amc stock versus a mid $60 Gamestop stock. NO APE LEFT BEHIND\n\n\\- The stock does still have significant volatility to make huge swings. Compared to Nokia for example, AMC has the potential to rise significantly in a short amount of time\n\n\\- The company itself is on the upside and people are getting optimistic that the stock could naturally reach $20 long term without the help of this subreddit (theaters opening up, vaccine rollouts, etc.). Meanwhile, rallying people to Gamestop is a tough sell when Gamestop probably won\'t maintain $60+ value in the long term (again, happy to be wrong here)\n\n\\- It\'s received a bunch of coverage. It\'s simply easier to get people informed compared to some random stock\n\n\\- The argument could be made that there\'s still value to be made off of a short squeeze\n\nIn short, **I\'m proposing AMC as a stock with potential to get everyone on the same page, but any low priced stock with potential would work (as long as the subreddit is united). We have a bunch of new people and attention now. Let\'s not waste it by tearing each other down or splitting into various factions**\n\n**TLDR: in bold**\n\n\\* It\'s important to note that you should always make huge gains or go down trying within reason. NEVER invest money that you are not prepared to lose. NEVER put yourself at risk of bankruptcy or depression\n\nEdit:\n\nJust wanted to clarify a few things:\n\n\\- The divide in the community I\'m talking about is with users of this sub insulting one another based on their stock positions. There are examples of people insulting me in this thread itself that prove my point. **Don\'t let money turn you into an asshole**\n\n\\- **The AMC recommendation is just that. A recommendation**. The same way people hyped up Tesla on this sub, I see potential in that stock and it\'s cheap so that\'s why I\'m recommending it to new people over GME, but I\'m just an ape so what do I know ¬Ø\\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\\_/¬Ø\n\n\\- **To people thinking that I\'m desperately trying to bump up the value of my positions: no**. If I really wanted to make money, I\'d be on r/stocks not here playing it risky. As someone that works in software, the couple hundred that I invested is not gonna make or break me, so losing it is fine with me.

I have no idea, but $GME is in a wholly unique and unprecedented position to find out.

This wrinkle is called the Stop Loss and is probably missing from most of you 8,000,000+ wsb subscribers.\n\nI probably need to preface this post since a lot of you probably can‚Äôt focus (or read) long enough to get past this section. I am NOT telling you to sell your GME shares. I think this entire event has been glorious and unprecedented in its cooperation across the world. That being said, I am simply providing information to those people who cannot handle the losses they may be risking by investing in the BANG gang.\n\nMany, okay most of you, are holding GME, NOK, BB, or AMC. With their erratic price movement, you should have an out. I personally don‚Äôt trade without a stop loss, but then again, I am not a diamond-handed ape and like to control my losses.\n\nThis is how a stop loss works in simple terms:\n\n1. monkey buys share for $100 each.\n2. Monkey then creates a sell order, but instead of using ‚Äúlimit‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù, the monkey selects ‚ÄúStop Loss‚Äù or ‚ÄúStop on Quote‚Äù and types in the lowest price they are willing to sell\n3. Confirm order\n\nCongrats, you set up a stop loss and are a savvy trader.\n\n‚ÄúOh, but why would I buy high sell low?‚Äù Well, you can answer to your own god why you bought high. The real reason for entering this order is to prevent further bleeding than you can handle.\n\nIt is impossible to browse WSB without seeing some form of loss porn coupled with ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear no bell‚Äù or ‚ÄúIM NOT FUCKING SELLING.‚Äù That‚Äôs great and all, but for those smaller fish who need to pay rent or are risking their student loans (yeah, you Mr. dental school), I encourage using this safety net.\n\nFirst, figure out what you are comfortable losing. If that is 20%, great use that. If you have GME with an average of $100 per share (not impossible based on today‚Äôs price movement), set your Stop Loss order for $80. Now, if GME drops below $80, congrats you got out and wont risk bleeding down to wherever it ends up. (note: this order is only active during regular trading hours. You are on your own afterhours).\n\n‚ÄúBut Mr. Tacos, what if it bounces back?!‚Äù yeah that happens, but hey this is gambling, nothing is a sure thing.

And because sometimes, despite (or because of?) the collective stupidity, I learn a lot.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nLike: **How to lose money** ü§ë üò≠. Quickly. *Seriously.* Learning how to lose money is so hard. I mean, I only invested about 3500 total. But still, thanks to you guys, managed to lose at least 1500!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut seriously, thanks! Because for a measly 1500 greenbacks, as someone who has never, ever invested I learned:\n\n\n- how to use a trading platform\n- how to read critically\n- how to place limit orders and not market orders \n- how basic options works\n- how to navigate insane amounts of hype, stupidity, and propaganda (the SLVR, BB, NOK pushers, which were always obvious targeted distractions\n- how little power I have\n- how even less knowledge I have.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo here are a few lessons (which I\'m still learning) which I‚Äôd like to share with y\'all.\n\n1. **Be critical of everything** - There are not only a lot of shills and bots out there (I‚Äôm looking at you, $SLVR-pushers!) but there are, surprise surprise even more autists. Especially with 6 million new accounts of presumably people who have never invested in their live, but in classic Internet-style, already tout themselves as steel-balled market gurus. From people posting data that‚Äôs [fundamentally wrong] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcds9k/short_interest_is_226_per_finra_do_not_sell/glz8xq8/?context=3), fundamentally misinterpreted, or coming to conclusions without enough data or just plain old confirmation bias (basically, all of WSB). Special shoutout to [u/smohyee\'s] (https://www.reddit.com/user/smohyee) very [sober post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/) which helped me look critically at stuff that has been flying around the forum these last days.\n\n2. **Don‚Äôt underestimate my ignorance** - I know nothing. Literally nothing. I can do basic addition and subtraction, and know stocks go up and down. Personally, the market seems like a huge insane bubble ready to burst at any second. But maybe not. What do I know? ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm as autistic as you. ü§§\n\n3. **Get in before the hype** - Even to my stupid, ignorant self, I realized buying GME at an all-time high of 150X its low, was a stupid idea. Especially when the entire Internet and even non-Internet media was buzzing with the hype. *3B. (Corollary). - If you are going to go up against a Hedge fund with is 10000X more powerful than you, don‚Äôt announce all your moves up front.* \n \n4. **Understand what the statistics and metrics mean before betting (I mean: "investing")** - People are posting volume data, short interest numbers, using fancy lingo and stats that I still can‚Äôt wrap my brain around (I still haven‚Äôt understood how you can sell a put you don‚Äôt have for example, that‚Äôs how ignorant I am). But, as the wise men &amp; women say - ignorance is an opportunity to redeem yourself.\n\n5. **Don‚Äôt underestimate all the other players** - Hedge funds, Retirement funds. Whales. They all have different agendas. And their agendas are not yours. The worst mistakes I saw were not acknowledging the special advantages that institutional investors will always have. This is not *cheating*. This is how the market works. You can be a crybaby autist about it, but that‚Äôs how it is (I wrote a bit about some of the advantages even I saw that HF have [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbifwv/a_skeptics_post_can_wsb_win_the_gme_standoff_even/) - me, who knows nothing about investing). Institutional Investors have sentiment trackers, high-speed algorithms, inside information, battle-hardened experience, tricky tactics, etc. You are not going to beat any Hedge Fund of Institutional Investor at a game they invented, made the rules in, and excel at.\n\n6. **Expertise is valuable** - There is a very good reason why finance jobs, especially at Investment Banks, Hedge Funds and Private Equity firms are the best-paid jobs in the world - because they places hire very fucking smart people, who work very fucking hard (7 days a week, 14-hour days), to be better at this than you or I. The expectation that we be as good as them, is like expecting to pop out of your mom‚Äôs womb and run a 100m faster than Usain Bolt without a day‚Äôs training. The reason we don‚Äôt like Hedge Funds or the stock market in general, is it is because it a casino for the wealthy. We are the poor schlubs sitting at the 1 dollar blackjack table, while watching the billionaires in their Tuxedos coming out of their Bentley‚Äôs to play at the million dollar poker tables. From a recent Economist article this week: *‚ÄúEven in America stock market gains have mainly accrued to the rich. The wealthiest 1% owns 56% of the stock market, up from 46% in 1990; the top 10% owns 88% of the market.‚Äù*\n\n7. **The HF didn‚Äôt cheat. They don\'t need to. They hustled** - They invited ignorant newbies to sit at their tables (yes, that‚Äôs us), and then fleeced us of our cash. We are idiots, because we KNEW the hustle was coming and we KNEW the pros were pros, and yet we STILL played against them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Little reminders for myself for next time:**\n\n1. **Accept the risk** - Any money I gamble in this friggin casino I can count as lost.\n2. **If you have no clue, don‚Äôt bet** - I have no clue what a ‚ÄúCalendar Call‚Äù or a ‚ÄúVertical Call‚Äù is. You can bet I won‚Äôt be making that, until I do.\n3. **Losing (preferably a little bit) of money, is a very strong motivation to learn.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd a li‚Äô tip for my fellow autists:\n\n**Don‚Äôt post fucking DDs if you are an ignorant shit.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPositions - Holding 215 AMC (115 bought  (stupidly, and during the hype) @14; 100 bought during a dip @ 8.11)\nHolding 2 GME (1 free from RH, 1 bought at 115)\n1 SPY put 332; EXP 03/31\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFinal final note (for real, this time):\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***If you think the stock market is unfair, you are right.

You guys may not know this but its actually possible to hold more than one type of stock at the same time.**\n\n**The Boomer DD (Source: goldsilver.com)**\n\n*Why silver is a good investment*\n\nSilver cannot be created out of thin air. It cannot be printed.\n\nSilver has no counter-party risk. Physical silver does not rely on another party making good on their contract. Silver also outperforms Gold in bull markets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Gold vs Silver](https://preview.redd.it/bjnbtrtjpgf61.png?width=1386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4536c7c77ab04631c9de08daf8caae9dc2c6ba11)\n\nGovernment inventories of silver are also falling. Since silver does have industrial uses, in the future these industrial demands will be difficult to meet. This is because governments no longer hold large stockpiles of silver due to the fact that they no longer need the silver to make coins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8uf985knpgf61.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41c26d5a8d97396556e07a1c9b5d218660cac6da\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSilver use in industrial production is also increasing.\n\nThere is silver in cell phones, things like self heating windshields, as a catalyst for the production of plastics and chemicals etc.\n\nOne key use of silver is its use in photovoltaic cells, which is the main constituent of solar panels. So silver is also a solar energy play. With Biden taking office, we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil.\n\nPhotovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels.  Read more about it [here](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/how-does-photovoltaic-cell-work)\n\nOn average, a solar panel uses about 20 grams of silver.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[China needs silver but can\'t get it](https://preview.redd.it/mx8ng1mppgf61.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28b940133f96c3c4934fbe3490cf557117ac5ec)\n\n*Silver supply is dropping*\n\nSilver prices crashed after it peaked in 2011. As silver dropped 72.1%, silver miners had to find ways to cut costs to keep turning profit. What they did was they dramatically decreased the amount of exploration and development for silver mines. As such, Silver production is in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart for you](https://preview.redd.it/jd7j4f5tpgf61.png?width=1314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf89b396074924c03685e65bcb4ae1556f7c90e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to conclude the boomer DD:\n\n\\- Inflation is on the rise\n\n\\- Too much money is being printed\n\n\\- Silver outperforms gold\n\n\\- Silver biggest use is industrial use\n\n\\- Silver demand is increasing\n\n\\- Silver supply is dropping\n\n**WSB DD üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to [coingape.com](https://coingape.com) , in order to pull short squeeze of hedge funds (not necessarily JP Morgan), we would need silver to go to $500\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Some tweet they put on their site idk üöÄüöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/6dej6iowpgf61.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33a578db6f235c5e14b7d420637ce7936838b6d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, I am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver ( Hello SEC! )\n\nI\'m just saying that I really like SLV stock, and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons. There is also an additional upside of the fact that IF for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely. This is because unlike the GME short squeeze, where GME can issue new stock, a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver, because silver cannot be printed.\n\nAlso, we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the GME short squeeze. Robinhood restricting bought GME shares, brokers being gay etc etc. The difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy, and all the new people who just joined WSB in the daily discussion thread going "Hey guys i\'m a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can I buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you" can also join in. If a short squeeze were to happen, this is how it would happen.\n\n1. People buy SLV stock (not random ETF\'s because they don\'t buy physical silver)\n2. Silver price go up\n3. JP Morgan ANGRY\n4. Robinhood and other brokers experience "temporary outages", "Buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason" , "Limiting SLV shares that can be bought"\n5. WSB and noobs who don\'t know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins. Or since we are in a pandemic order it off eBay or something\n\nBasically, the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way.\n\nWhether or not large banks like JP Morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because it\'s heavily debated and I don\'t know the answer, but what we can CONFIRM is that HEDGE FUNDS are short on silver.\n\nMaybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rebuttals against the bullish case on silver**\n\nI have been drafting this message for a while, and at the same time have skimmed a few anti-silver posts. The common points against this is\n\n\\- One contract is too expensive\n\n\\- People who don\'t know how to trade futures will get stuck with it\n\n\\- Its taking attention away from GME\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*One contract is too expensive*\n\nThe contracts you are referring to are the futures, aka paper silver. There are three ways to buy physical silver\n\n1. But silver futures and take delivery\n2. Buy SLV shares\n3. Buy Silver from jewellers or online sellers\n\nThere are currently around 5 times more contracts for silver in the COMEX markets than there is supply of it. This means that when you buy SLV futures and exercise it, the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who DOES have it. Once we do this, they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market. Companies like TSLA, Samsung and Canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile, because they know that supply is dwindling. People have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too, if you don\'t believe me check for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*People who don\'t know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees*\n\nSee above\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Its taking attention away from GME*\n\nI am not being paid by anyone to write this, i just genuinely see the potential for it. While I do agree that GME is still relevant, it doesn\'t mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios. We shouldn\'t miss out on silver just because we are still in GME. Besides, a SLV squeeze would be much more beneficial than the GME squeeze because of my last point below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Last and most important point - the benefit of a silver price rise**\n\n**When GME prices go up, who benefits? Shareholders, hedge funds who are long GME, banks, etc**\n\n**When BITCOIN moons, who benefits? Banks, rich people, people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it, people who have access to bitcoin wallets, brokers etc.**\n\n**When we blow up stocks like GME and BTC, even though we profit, and even if we bankrupt hedge funds, the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own GME stock.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BUT WHO OWNS SILVER?**\n\nAlmost every household owns some silver. Whether its\' bars, coins, or religious statues. Poorer countries and places, like Asia and Africa, most households have a small silver chain, a family heirloom, ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket I don\'t know.\n\nIf silver prices moon, money goes to the people, even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver, silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of. If we can get silver back to its FAIR VALUE, through the reasons and HYPOTHETICAL methods I mentioned above, we can not only burn hedge funds, profit for ourselves, but also help poor families.\n\nPoor people don\'t how to set up a brokerage account and buy Gamestonk. Poor people don\'t know how to trade cryptocurrencies. Poor people don\'t have the capital to enter into the stock market. What they DO have is gold and silver (mainly silver).  When they don\'t have the knowledge or ability to buy shares (As proven with the recent influx of people with "What is a broker" kind of questions), they get left out of these massive wealth transfers. Its much easier to say "Buy silver lol" than "Ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs, verify all your information, deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose...."\n\nIf you want to bankrupt hedge funds, don\'t transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long GME. Instead, transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families.\n\nTLDR WSB DD: If silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you.

This analysis is not based on any financial wisdom and you should always do your own diligence and research for any personal financial decisions.\n\nI am basing my analysis on a theory based on the quote above by one of my favorite guys Elon Musk. So what long term outcome is the most entertaining in this case? How about TSLA decides to buy a heavy portion of GameStop? Sounds crazy? Good, let\'s see where this goes. This is what I\'m dubbing the "Planet of the Apes" theory.\n\nThe case for why TSLA can and should acquire GameStop to make a lot of money.\n\nLong Rant:\nSo there are two conflicting realities right now, retarded geniuses have crippled big hedge funds while not really doing any damage, they got really rich while losing it all. Gamestop is a worthless company that is actually fundamentally able to pay their bills, has locations all over the country and unlimited loyalty and PR from a massive online fanbase through a once in a lifetime event like this. The price shouldn\'t be so high but we need to restrict buying volume to deflate the momentum. The shorts have already covered their positions while also doubling down and digging themselves deeper.\n\nOne of these realities will become true at some point soon. You may have already made up your mind but I\'m still holding and waiting. I\'m not a fanboy, I\'ve made risky moves before. Actually read headlines about companies that I had thousands in announce bankruptcy and get delisted. With diversification your gains are still more likely to outweigh your losses in the LONG RUN. Meaning investment doesn\'t happen over the course of days but rather weeks, months, or even years.üíéüíé‚úä‚úä \n\nWe all know Musk is a visionary who is unafraid to enter a new, risky venture. He\'s done it all, payment platforms, electric cars, outer space, even UNDERGROUND! The man is the the king of chasing big ideas in unlikely markets and that\'s why he\'s so cool. He makes EV-ATVs and flamethrowers for fun. And he hasn\'t been shy about supporting us during this time. I think it\'s fair to say he likes the stock.\n\nNow let\'s compare TSLA and GME. TSLA has a $800 BILLION market cap. GME has a $4.7 BILLION market cap, currently down from over $20 Billion a few days ago. So they could be bought right now at a 20% discount from their all time high. Now, I\'m more retarded than most apes, but to me, that sounds like a pretty good deal for an opportunity to turn around GME by logically pivoting to e-commerce, e-sports, cloud gaming and start to compete with Microsoft and Sony and every other big name in this massive market space, while gaining a massive amount of customer loyalty and support for their other products. This would further diversify TSLAs revenue sources and allow for a lot of really fun marketing opportunities like Tesla racing video game, or console for example.\n\nNow of course, this is fiction. I made it up. But let me tell you a retarded reason why that doesn\'t matter. This is a real thing that happened to me a while ago and no amount of doubting from anyone will change this totally real experience I had. Here goes, I was sitting in a taco bell and I ordered a $2 meal deal for my broke ass which was an awesome deal because you got a 5 layer burrito, a drink, and a bag of Doritos. And as I was sitting there in my favorite restaurant, admiring the genius that came up with Baja blast mountain dew, and how genius ideas like that are worth millions. And as I was eating a Dorito I realized, this is just a taco shell, broken into a small triangle, with Dorito powder. They should just partner and make a Dorito taco, people will go crazy for it. And then I immediately went about my life as normal. Over a year later Taco Bell announced the Dorito loco taco and completely saved the company with that one idea that I had and never shared with anybody.\n\nWhat does any of this mean? I have the power to make up crazy things and they actually come true on at least one or two occasions in the past. \n\nTLDR: I like the stock. I like Elon and I think he likes the stock too. TSLA buying GME potentially means big gains for everyone and is the most entertaining possibility which makes it the most likely. I\'m actually a savaant as proven by my totally real taco bell story. Holding GME 25 shares avg cost $198. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüåïüåñüåóüåòüåëüåíüåìüåîüåï'), ('I bought above 200 and I am not fking sell, but there is one more important thing', "I bought above 200 and I am not fking sell, but there is one more important thingI was pretty lucky cause I entered the market as a retail trader 7,8 years ago (who only buy stuff like spy, qqq, amazon etc), so I didn't really have any experiences with 2008 crisis.

Now that GME is the dinner  conversation topic of the world, everyone and their moms have an  opinion.  We will be told we don\'t matter.  We don\'t know what we are  doing(probably true. I got into stocks 2 weeks ago).  We should have  sold at the peak.  We should have bought lower.  We shouldn\'t have  gambled.  What people are forgetting is what WE are trying, is to do  better, and be better.  Why kick a guy down when he wants a better  fucking life.  FUCK YOU.\n\nLOOK AT  THE PPL SPENDING THEIR TENDIES TO GIVE BACK.  It\'s our $, let us do what  we want with it.  If a hedgie can irresponsibly short a stock over  100%, why can\'t we take a CALCULATED risk?  BUUUT funDamentAls.   Gamestop is a dying company.  The former business model of GME is dying.   As most physical businesses are.  See 24 hour fitness.  (I\'ve never  been inside a gym but I read stuff online)  But GME is pivoting.  PAPA  COWEN and the new board members are pivoting to e-commerce.  He\'s  assembling the fucking avengers to the END GAME but this is just getting  started.  GME is transforming just like Netflix when it went from DVDs  to online streaming.  We are the ugly duckling that gets super sexy  after growing pains.\n\nHow about  this for fuuunDamentAls.  Hedge funds being allowed to short a stock  over 100% and nobody comments on how that happened.  Why it happened.   And how SHORTING has INFINITE room to lose.  Keep in mind, they are  sophisticated gamblers with other people\'s money and 401ks.  BUT  according to their calculation it\'s little to no risk.  Because they can  throw more $ at the problem and manipulate the market, they can fix it!   If they can\'t, they want to cry to the media, get the public opinion  on their side, and ask for MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  Why would a  greedy $ machine ask for more oversight?  OH, that\'s because the SEC is  your lapdog and the government will bail you out with tax payer dollars.   SEE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  Yet, we are not allowed to exploit the law  of supply and demand.  If the demand exceeds 100% of the supply, the  inherit value ROCKETS.  See RTX cards and AMD chips.  FUCK SCALPERS for  good measure :)\n\nI want to remind  every single one of you, we do matter.  We have NUMBERS on our side.  As  a collective we\'ve already made shorting a topic of conversation at the  political level.  This may not be a monetary victory but it hopefully  is a step in the right direction to a more equal game.  That or hold  your politicians accountable.  You are their constituents.\n\nWe  play out in the open.  We share publicly available information and make  decisions base.  Really, it\'s just autistic people posting the exact  confirmation biases that we needed to see.  It prints $$$$ BRRrrrrr.\n\nLet\'s recap how the odds are stacked against us.\n\n\\-We  are too stupid to be allowed to spend our money.  We need government  intervention to "protect us".  The little guys, the plebes, the  unsophisticated, etc..  Yet they can\'t decide on how/when to get a  stimmy check to us.  THEY REALLY REALLY CARE (when hedge funds lose  money).  We some how took wallstreet down with $600.  If the stock  market was that fragile, we have BIGGER issues.\n\n\\-Momentum  was killed last week by brokers being held to new collateral  requirements by clearing houses.  Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they\'re  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn\'t  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.\n\n\\-News outlet and controlling the narrative.  How many analysts, journalist, and their rich ~~daddies~~  overlords are framing this as WSB pumping and dumping a meme stock.  WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?  You deplorable sacks of shit who get no enjoyment out of life  other than sucking the souls and money out of people.  You live to see  more zeros in your account and there is a special place in hell for you.\n\n\\-SEC  holding a meeting tonight investigating market manipulation through  social media but no investigative statement on how clearing houses can  magically conjure a rule that halts trading for retail investors.   Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they\'re not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.\n\n\\-How  shorts magically covered their positions but DO NOT have to report their  positions until weeks later.  Lack of immediate transparency gives them  ample time to reposition and multiple options to cover their asses  while blaming us.\n\nAnyways, I could  keep bitching but I just wanted to vent and rally us together.  We took  a mad beating. I just wanted to let you beautiful online strangers that  you aren\'t alone.  GME has transcended and has evolved into a movement.\n\nWhat  does GME mean to me?  A down-payment to a home for my family and I.  My  wife and I are expecting our first kid.  I\'m risking something I can  lose... for a better future.\n\nWhat does GME mean to you?\n\nTLDR; We fucking matter.  We are going to be the catalyst of change. HOLD SHARES.

But for a core position, Ford isn\'t bad.\n\n**It\'s a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.\n\nIf you want to talk fundamentals, PE is something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass, putting it into small bags and selling it for 79c/lb for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.\n\nIf you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don\'t care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.\n\n**Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden\'s "plan" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that\'s what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. Yes GM will probably do the same thing, but GM doesn\'t have this next point which changes the situation.\n\n**So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it\'s never going to happen. I would never buy a phone from Ford for example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.\n\nGM does not have this. GM does not have anyone to prostitute their driver data to. Sure, GM can do that, but GM is expensive and their small cars business will be absolutely killed by the deluge of new small EV manufacturers over the years.\n\nSo... don\'t do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50).\n\n**Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don\'t want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars.

Well today I want to take some time to add some wrinkles to your smooth brains. This wrinkle is called the Stop Loss and is probably missing from most of you 8,000,000+ wsb subscribers.\n\nI probably need to preface this post since a lot of you probably can‚Äôt focus (or read) long enough to get past this section. I am NOT telling you to sell your GME shares. I think this entire event has been glorious and unprecedented in its cooperation across the world. That being said, I am simply providing information to those people who cannot handle the losses they may be risking by investing in the BANG gang.\n\nMany, okay most of you, are holding GME, NOK, BB, or AMC. With their erratic price movement, you should have an out. I personally don‚Äôt trade without a stop loss, but then again, I am not a diamond-handed ape and like to control my losses.\n\nThis is how a stop loss works in simple terms:\n\n1. monkey buys share for $100 each.\n2. Monkey then creates a sell order, but instead of using ‚Äúlimit‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù, the monkey selects ‚ÄúStop Loss‚Äù or ‚ÄúStop on Quote‚Äù and types in the lowest price they are willing to sell\n3. Confirm order\n\nCongrats, you set up a stop loss and are a savvy trader.\n\n‚ÄúOh, but why would I buy high sell low?‚Äù Well, you can answer to your own god why you bought high. The real reason for entering this order is to prevent further bleeding than you can handle.\n\nIt is impossible to browse WSB without seeing some form of loss porn coupled with ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear no bell‚Äù or ‚ÄúIM NOT FUCKING SELLING.‚Äù That‚Äôs great and all, but for those smaller fish who need to pay rent or are risking their student loans (yeah, you Mr. dental school), I encourage using this safety net.\n\nFirst, figure out what you are comfortable losing. If that is 20%, great use that. If you have GME with an average of $100 per share (not impossible based on today‚Äôs price movement), set your Stop Loss order for $80. Now, if GME drops below $80, congrats you got out and wont risk bleeding down to wherever it ends up. (note: this order is only active during regular trading hours. You are on your own afterhours).\n\n‚ÄúBut Mr. Tacos, what if it bounces back?!‚Äù yeah that happens, but hey this is gambling, nothing is a sure thing. Be safe, invest smart, and always have an exit strategy. If you are a diamond handed ape willing to ride it to $0, may you have a spot reserved in stock-Valhalla (or the WSB hall of losses). If not?

Sure, trading on volatile stocks like the BANG gang isn\'t going to be as effective as on something like SPY. That being said, the idea of "only invest what you are willing to lose" is completely misapplied here. \n\nIf you are will to lose $1000, that does not mean you are limited to investing $1000.

Sometimes you need to be proactive and not wait/pray for a short squeeze to happen. \n\nFor example: If I have a position in AAPL and for whatever reason it drops 30%, I wont sell it since I know it will eventually come back and just collect dividends during the wait because of AAPL\'s FUNDAMENTALS. \n\nPeople need to understand that GME was a high risk high reward play.

What do I know? ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm as autistic as you. ü§§\n\n3. **Get in before the hype** - Even to my stupid, ignorant self, I realized buying GME at an all-time high of 150X its low, was a stupid idea. Especially when the entire Internet and even non-Internet media was buzzing with the hype. *3B. (Corollary). - If you are going to go up against a Hedge fund with is 10000X more powerful than you, don‚Äôt announce all your moves up front.* \n \n4. **Understand what the statistics and metrics mean before betting (I mean: "investing")** - People are posting volume data, short interest numbers, using fancy lingo and stats that I still can‚Äôt wrap my brain around (I still haven‚Äôt understood how you can sell a put you don‚Äôt have for example, that‚Äôs how ignorant I am). But, as the wise men &amp; women say - ignorance is an opportunity to redeem yourself.\n\n5. **Don‚Äôt underestimate all the other players** - Hedge funds, Retirement funds. Whales. They all have different agendas. And their agendas are not yours. The worst mistakes I saw were not acknowledging the special advantages that institutional investors will always have. This is not *cheating*. This is how the market works. You can be a crybaby autist about it, but that‚Äôs how it is (I wrote a bit about some of the advantages even I saw that HF have [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbifwv/a_skeptics_post_can_wsb_win_the_gme_standoff_even/) - me, who knows nothing about investing). Institutional Investors have sentiment trackers, high-speed algorithms, inside information, battle-hardened experience, tricky tactics, etc. You are not going to beat any Hedge Fund of Institutional Investor at a game they invented, made the rules in, and excel at.\n\n6. **Expertise is valuable** - There is a very good reason why finance jobs, especially at Investment Banks, Hedge Funds and Private Equity firms are the best-paid jobs in the world - because they places hire very fucking smart people, who work very fucking hard (7 days a week, 14-hour days), to be better at this than you or I. The expectation that we be as good as them, is like expecting to pop out of your mom‚Äôs womb and run a 100m faster than Usain Bolt without a day‚Äôs training. The reason we don‚Äôt like Hedge Funds or the stock market in general, is it is because it a casino for the wealthy. We are the poor schlubs sitting at the 1 dollar blackjack table, while watching the billionaires in their Tuxedos coming out of their Bentley‚Äôs to play at the million dollar poker tables. From a recent Economist article this week: *‚ÄúEven in America stock market gains have mainly accrued to the rich. The wealthiest 1% owns 56% of the stock market, up from 46% in 1990; the top 10% owns 88% of the market.‚Äù*\n\n7. **The HF didn‚Äôt cheat. They don\'t need to. They hustled** - They invited ignorant newbies to sit at their tables (yes, that‚Äôs us), and then fleeced us of our cash. We are idiots, because we KNEW the hustle was coming and we KNEW the pros were pros, and yet we STILL played against them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Little reminders for myself for next time:**\n\n1. **Accept the risk** - Any money I gamble in this friggin casino I can count as lost.\n2. **If you have no clue, don‚Äôt bet** - I have no clue what a ‚ÄúCalendar Call‚Äù or a ‚ÄúVertical Call‚Äù is.

TSLA &gt;NIO and all other EV scams out there‚Ä¶GME&gt;AMC and other squeeze scams‚Ä¶so what is Kuaishou&gt;?????\nThat answer is BILI‚Ä¶I am too fucking lazy to show that BILI is the closest thing to Kuaishou on the US stock exchange‚Ä¶just trust me it is‚Ä¶I know the stock has ran up a bit but it is just recovering from the GME induced crash on the overall market.  Kuaishou‚Äôs IPO is afterhours today‚Ä¶so there should be a nice run up in BILI today and a jump tomorrow based on the Kuaishou hype extending possibility to Monday.\n\nThe Play:\n\nTwo and at max three day play on short term slightly OTM BILI Call options.  I expect the PT to be around 160-170 or around 10% gains‚Ä¶which will produce 1~2X gains on the options.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/E1gHn9x\n\nIf you are curious as to how I made my millions...well I had abt 100K when GME was at 20...now at close to to 4M...Just making side hustles while waiting for GME to pop again.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ'), ('$41,000 TSLA Put Loss', '$41,000 TSLA Put Loss'), ('Silver Shiny Me Likey (Read disclaimer b4 downvote GME gang)', 'Silver Shiny Me Likey (Read disclaimer b4 downvote GME gang)**\\*This post is about physical silver, not the ETF\'s or futures contracts**\n\n**Hello SEC! Thank you for reading my due diligence on Silver. Please note I am not inciting a short squeeze I\'m just telling people that I like SLV and why they should consider liking it too.

This DD will be split into two parts:\n\n1. Why SLV in on itself is a good and safe investment (Boomer DD)\n2. Why SLV has moon mission potential (WSB DD)\n\n**We should not miss the silver play just because we are currently in GME. You guys may not know this but its actually possible to hold more than one type of stock at the same time.**\n\n**The Boomer DD (Source: goldsilver.com)**\n\n*Why silver is a good investment*\n\nSilver cannot be created out of thin air. It cannot be printed.\n\nSilver has no counter-party risk. Physical silver does not rely on another party making good on their contract. Silver also outperforms Gold in bull markets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Gold vs Silver](https://preview.redd.it/bjnbtrtjpgf61.png?width=1386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4536c7c77ab04631c9de08daf8caae9dc2c6ba11)\n\nGovernment inventories of silver are also falling. Since silver does have industrial uses, in the future these industrial demands will be difficult to meet. This is because governments no longer hold large stockpiles of silver due to the fact that they no longer need the silver to make coins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8uf985knpgf61.png?width=1388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41c26d5a8d97396556e07a1c9b5d218660cac6da\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSilver use in industrial production is also increasing.\n\nThere is silver in cell phones, things like self heating windshields, as a catalyst for the production of plastics and chemicals etc.\n\nOne key use of silver is its use in photovoltaic cells, which is the main constituent of solar panels. So silver is also a solar energy play. With Biden taking office, we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil.\n\nPhotovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels.  Read more about it [here](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/how-does-photovoltaic-cell-work)\n\nOn average, a solar panel uses about 20 grams of silver.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[China needs silver but can\'t get it](https://preview.redd.it/mx8ng1mppgf61.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28b940133f96c3c4934fbe3490cf557117ac5ec)\n\n*Silver supply is dropping*\n\nSilver prices crashed after it peaked in 2011. As silver dropped 72.1%, silver miners had to find ways to cut costs to keep turning profit. What they did was they dramatically decreased the amount of exploration and development for silver mines. As such, Silver production is in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart for you](https://preview.redd.it/jd7j4f5tpgf61.png?width=1314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf89b396074924c03685e65bcb4ae1556f7c90e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to conclude the boomer DD:\n\n\\- Inflation is on the rise\n\n\\- Too much money is being printed\n\n\\- Silver outperforms gold\n\n\\- Silver biggest use is industrial use\n\n\\- Silver demand is increasing\n\n\\- Silver supply is dropping\n\n**WSB DD üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to [coingape.com](https://coingape.com) , in order to pull short squeeze of hedge funds (not necessarily JP Morgan), we would need silver to go to $500\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Some tweet they put on their site idk üöÄüöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/6dej6iowpgf61.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33a578db6f235c5e14b7d420637ce7936838b6d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, I am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver ( Hello SEC! )\n\nI\'m just saying that I really like SLV stock, and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons. There is also an additional upside of the fact that IF for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely. This is because unlike the GME short squeeze, where GME can issue new stock, a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver, because silver cannot be printed.\n\nAlso, we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the GME short squeeze. Robinhood restricting bought GME shares, brokers being gay etc etc. The difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy, and all the new people who just joined WSB in the daily discussion thread going "Hey guys i\'m a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can I buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you" can also join in. If a short squeeze were to happen, this is how it would happen.\n\n1. People buy SLV stock (not random ETF\'s because they don\'t buy physical silver)\n2. Silver price go up\n3. JP Morgan ANGRY\n4. Robinhood and other brokers experience "temporary outages", "Buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason" , "Limiting SLV shares that can be bought"\n5. WSB and noobs who don\'t know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins. Or since we are in a pandemic order it off eBay or something\n\nBasically, the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way.\n\nWhether or not large banks like JP Morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because it\'s heavily debated and I don\'t know the answer, but what we can CONFIRM is that HEDGE FUNDS are short on silver.\n\nMaybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rebuttals against the bullish case on silver**\n\nI have been drafting this message for a while, and at the same time have skimmed a few anti-silver posts. The common points against this is\n\n\\- One contract is too expensive\n\n\\- People who don\'t know how to trade futures will get stuck with it\n\n\\- Its taking attention away from GME\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*One contract is too expensive*\n\nThe contracts you are referring to are the futures, aka paper silver. There are three ways to buy physical silver\n\n1. But silver futures and take delivery\n2. Buy SLV shares\n3. Buy Silver from jewellers or online sellers\n\nThere are currently around 5 times more contracts for silver in the COMEX markets than there is supply of it. This means that when you buy SLV futures and exercise it, the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who DOES have it. Once we do this, they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market. Companies like TSLA, Samsung and Canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile, because they know that supply is dwindling. People have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too, if you don\'t believe me check for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*People who don\'t know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees*\n\nSee above\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Its taking attention away from GME*\n\nI am not being paid by anyone to write this, i just genuinely see the potential for it. While I do agree that GME is still relevant, it doesn\'t mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios. We shouldn\'t miss out on silver just because we are still in GME. Besides, a SLV squeeze would be much more beneficial than the GME squeeze because of my last point below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Last and most important point - the benefit of a silver price rise**\n\n**When GME prices go up, who benefits? Shareholders, hedge funds who are long GME, banks, etc**\n\n**When BITCOIN moons, who benefits? Banks, rich people, people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it, people who have access to bitcoin wallets, brokers etc.**\n\n**When we blow up stocks like GME and BTC, even though we profit, and even if we bankrupt hedge funds, the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own GME stock.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BUT WHO OWNS SILVER?**\n\nAlmost every household owns some silver. Whether its\' bars, coins, or religious statues. Poorer countries and places, like Asia and Africa, most households have a small silver chain, a family heirloom, ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket I don\'t know.\n\nIf silver prices moon, money goes to the people, even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver, silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of. If we can get silver back to its FAIR VALUE, through the reasons and HYPOTHETICAL methods I mentioned above, we can not only burn hedge funds, profit for ourselves, but also help poor families.\n\nPoor people don\'t how to set up a brokerage account and buy Gamestonk. Poor people don\'t know how to trade cryptocurrencies. Poor people don\'t have the capital to enter into the stock market. What they DO have is gold and silver (mainly silver).  When they don\'t have the knowledge or ability to buy shares (As proven with the recent influx of people with "What is a broker" kind of questions), they get left out of these massive wealth transfers. Its much easier to say "Buy silver lol" than "Ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs, verify all your information, deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose...."\n\nIf you want to bankrupt hedge funds, don\'t transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long GME. Instead, transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families.\n\nTLDR WSB DD: If silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you. Also silver buying cannot be restricted because you don\'t need a broker to buy silver. (IF YOU ARE READING THIS DITCH ROBINHOOD AND CHANGE BROKERS. IF YOU DON\'T CHANGE BROKRS THEY WILL KEEP DOING THINGS LIKE THIS \\[When you don\'t pay for a product you ARE the product\\])\n\nRegardless or whether or not we take part, silver will get to its fair value. Although it would be faster if we joined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStocks I like: SLV\n\nStocks I DO NOT LIKE: silver ETF\'s that have paper silver positions\n\nIf you have questions, counterpoints, suggestions or edits message me u/Prestigious_West_524'), ('GME and why do we matter', 'GME and why do we matterI  fling poop and drag my knuckles on the floor.

Now that GME is the dinner  conversation topic of the world, everyone and their moms have an  opinion.  We will be told we don\'t matter.  We don\'t know what we are  doing(probably true. I got into stocks 2 weeks ago).  We should have  sold at the peak.  We should have bought lower.  We shouldn\'t have  gambled.  What people are forgetting is what WE are trying, is to do  better, and be better.  Why kick a guy down when he wants a better  fucking life.  FUCK YOU.\n\nLOOK AT  THE PPL SPENDING THEIR TENDIES TO GIVE BACK.  It\'s our $, let us do what  we want with it.

PAPA  COWEN and the new board members are pivoting to e-commerce.  He\'s  assembling the fucking avengers to the END GAME but this is just getting  started.  GME is transforming just like Netflix when it went from DVDs  to online streaming.  We are the ugly duckling that gets super sexy  after growing pains.\n\nHow about  this for fuuunDamentAls.  Hedge funds being allowed to short a stock  over 100% and nobody comments on how that happened.  Why it happened.   And how SHORTING has INFINITE room to lose.  Keep in mind, they are  sophisticated gamblers with other people\'s money and 401ks.  BUT  according to their calculation it\'s little to no risk.  Because they can  throw more $ at the problem and manipulate the market, they can fix it!   If they can\'t, they want to cry to the media, get the public opinion  on their side, and ask for MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  Why would a  greedy $ machine ask for more oversight?

The little guys, the plebes, the  unsophisticated, etc..  Yet they can\'t decide on how/when to get a  stimmy check to us.  THEY REALLY REALLY CARE (when hedge funds lose  money).  We some how took wallstreet down with $600.  If the stock  market was that fragile, we have BIGGER issues.\n\n\\-Momentum  was killed last week by brokers being held to new collateral  requirements by clearing houses.  Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they\'re  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn\'t  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.\n\n\\-News outlet and controlling the narrative.  How many analysts, journalist, and their rich ~~daddies~~  overlords are framing this as WSB pumping and dumping a meme stock.  WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?

Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they\'re not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors....

But for a core position, Ford isn\'t bad.\n\n**It\'s a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.\n\nIf you want to talk fundamentals, PE is something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass, putting it into small bags and selling it for 79c/lb for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.\n\nIf you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don\'t care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.\n\n**Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden\'s "plan" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that\'s what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. Yes GM will probably do the same thing, but GM doesn\'t have this next point which changes the situation.\n\n**So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it\'s never going to happen. I would never buy a phone from Ford for example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.\n\nGM does not have this. GM does not have anyone to prostitute their driver data to. Sure, GM can do that, but GM is expensive and their small cars business will be absolutely killed by the deluge of new small EV manufacturers over the years.\n\nSo... don\'t do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50).\n\n**Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don\'t want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars.

A free street team for everywhere!\n\n\\-Peoples. $GME could have more than brand loyalty, it has the possibility to ‚Äúhave peoples.‚Äù Like Applefolk. I really hope they don‚Äôt fuck this up. I hope to continue being a fan.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*And if there are any $GME Execs who think something like ‚ÄúWell I wouldn‚Äôt call that adverti‚Ä¶‚Äù Then my entire thesis is wrong. But after reading Ryan Cohen's letter to the Board, I‚Äôd be surprised that someone who thinks that way would still hold any position of influence at $GME.\n\n$GME Has MONEY with VISION. Have you read Cohen‚Äôs letter? I think I read it once two days ago after seeing DFV mention it in one of his posts. I read it again earlier today, but this time after having read Cuban‚Äôs AMA. That was critical. Between Cohen‚Äôs letter and Cuban‚Äôs wisdom, something happened. I ACTUALLY- LIKE DEEP IN MY SOUL- BEGAN TO LIKE THE STOCK!!!\n\nSo I stopped trying to daytrade FD‚Äôs to average down shares, and took a more intentional look at $GME‚Äôs story and plan moving forward.\n\n$GME should be so much more than a video game store, in the same way that McDonald‚Äôs is so much more than a fastfood restaurant. It‚Äôs like when Harry Sonneborn went to Ray Crock and was like ‚ÄúBro, you ain‚Äôt a restaurant owner, you‚Äôre a FUCKING REALESTATE MAGNATE!.‚Äù Ray didn‚Äôt know what he had... the template for a business that wouldn‚Äôt just disrupt the casual dining industry...it would DEFINE it.**WHO THE FUCK IS THE MACDONALDS OF GAMING?!**\n\n$GME is in a position to wipe out EVERYONE in one of the fastest growing industries in the world. We don‚Äôt even know how the video gaming is going to mature as an industry yet, just that it‚Äôs gonna be bigger than it already is.\n\nCohen knows this, DFV knows this, any of you who have been truly following GME before the circus began prolly came to the same conclusion.\n\nAnd Cuban knows this, but I think he saw something bigger.\n\nDid anyone wonder why one of the most prolific and popular billionaires in the whole world might expose himself to possible legal or PR disaster, just so he can do an AMA on one of the most politically incorrect discussion forums on the net, at a time when it‚Äôs being watched like hawk by fin regulators? Not only that, afterwards, he goes on a PR crusade in support of WSB!!!\n\nWhy? **Because this is the place to be.**\n\nAnd this pushes all those assets and ideas listed above to whole new level.\n\nThere may be something WAAAAAAYYY bigger than a squeeze, a turn around, or even the advent of a gaming empire. Mass Media hysteria, AOC and Cruz agreeing, dogs and cats living together! There‚Äôs something bigger that‚Äôs possible, and I‚Äôm not sure Cuban even knows what it is, just that it‚Äôs BIG and since he‚Äôs Mark Fucking Cuban...he made sure he was in it, but even more so, took a side and defended a conviction...For what? a bunch of tards chasing a squeeze? A chance to look cool in front of millennials? FUCK NO!...AND DOUBLE FUCK NO TO THE SECOND ONE!\n\nWe were all looking at charts, wondering what lines do, and scouring the sub looking for reassurance and more retarded DD, that I think we missed the value of $GME‚Äôs newest asset:\n\n**#GME fanatics and the Social and Cultural phenomenon they started.**\n\nWhat is the possible financial gain from the spirit (Geist) of the Squeeze ? I have no idea, but $GME is in a wholly unique and unprecedented position to find out. And this sparks joy and wonder in my soul.\n\nI‚Äôm grateful to all the work DFV has done, but I'm also grateful he is no longer posting updates. The pressure on that man to hold...HES STILL IN, IM STILL IN? That‚Äôs the only comment for like the first 1k comments!!! It was to the point where actual lives could have been at stake if he didn‚Äôt post an update, let alone a stock price. Have you watched his vids? Have you seen how fucking chill and cool he is? It's insane to think about the weight he carried.\n\nNonetheless, I‚Äôm in because I like the stock. That‚Äôs it. But I like to think DFV has similar ideas to those explained above, and will continue to hold for the same reason. I also like to think there‚Äôs a few VC‚Äôs out there with similar thoughts. Maybe a few billionaires that are looking for something that can be truly Good and new.\n\nLastly, All of the radical and possibly delusional assumptions I made to come to this conclusion might be absolutely wrong.\n\nTLDR: I actually like the stock.

Well today I want to take some time to add some wrinkles to your smooth brains. This wrinkle is called the Stop Loss and is probably missing from most of you 8,000,000+ wsb subscribers.\n\nI probably need to preface this post since a lot of you probably can‚Äôt focus (or read) long enough to get past this section. I am NOT telling you to sell your GME shares. I think this entire event has been glorious and unprecedented in its cooperation across the world. That being said, I am simply providing information to those people who cannot handle the losses they may be risking by investing in the BANG gang.\n\nMany, okay most of you, are holding GME, NOK, BB, or AMC. With their erratic price movement, you should have an out. I personally don‚Äôt trade without a stop loss, but then again, I am not a diamond-handed ape and like to control my losses.\n\nThis is how a stop loss works in simple terms:\n\n1. monkey buys share for $100 each.\n2. Monkey then creates a sell order, but instead of using ‚Äúlimit‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù, the monkey selects ‚ÄúStop Loss‚Äù or ‚ÄúStop on Quote‚Äù and types in the lowest price they are willing to sell\n3. Confirm order\n\nCongrats, you set up a stop loss and are a savvy trader.\n\n‚ÄúOh, but why would I buy high sell low?‚Äù Well, you can answer to your own god why you bought high. The real reason for entering this order is to prevent further bleeding than you can handle.\n\nIt is impossible to browse WSB without seeing some form of loss porn coupled with ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear no bell‚Äù or ‚ÄúIM NOT FUCKING SELLING.‚Äù That‚Äôs great and all, but for those smaller fish who need to pay rent or are risking their student loans (yeah, you Mr. dental school), I encourage using this safety net.\n\nFirst, figure out what you are comfortable losing. If that is 20%, great use that. If you have GME with an average of $100 per share (not impossible based on today‚Äôs price movement), set your Stop Loss order for $80. Now, if GME drops below $80, congrats you got out and wont risk bleeding down to wherever it ends up. (note: this order is only active during regular trading hours. You are on your own afterhours).\n\n‚ÄúBut Mr. Tacos, what if it bounces back?!‚Äù yeah that happens, but hey this is gambling, nothing is a sure thing. Be safe, invest smart, and always have an exit strategy. If you are a diamond handed ape willing to ride it to $0, may you have a spot reserved in stock-Valhalla (or the WSB hall of losses). If not?

Sure, trading on volatile stocks like the BANG gang isn\'t going to be as effective as on something like SPY. That being said, the idea of "only invest what you are willing to lose" is completely misapplied here. \n\nIf you are will to lose $1000, that does not mean you are limited to investing $1000.

Sometimes you need to be proactive and not wait/pray for a short squeeze to happen. \n\nFor example: If I have a position in AAPL and for whatever reason it drops 30%, I wont sell it since I know it will eventually come back and just collect dividends during the wait because of AAPL\'s FUNDAMENTALS. \n\nPeople need to understand that GME was a high risk high reward play.

Especially with 6 million new accounts of presumably people who have never invested in their live, but in classic Internet-style, already tout themselves as steel-balled market gurus.

Literally nothing. I can do basic addition and subtraction, and know stocks go up and down. Personally, the market seems like a huge insane bubble ready to burst at any second. But maybe not. What do I know? ü§∑\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm as autistic as you. ü§§\n\n3. **Get in before the hype** - Even to my stupid, ignorant self, I realized buying GME at an all-time high of 150X its low, was a stupid idea. Especially when the entire Internet and even non-Internet media was buzzing with the hype. *3B. (Corollary). - If you are going to go up against a Hedge fund with is 10000X more powerful than you, don‚Äôt announce all your moves up front.* \n \n4. **Understand what the statistics and metrics mean before betting (I mean: "investing")** - People are posting volume data, short interest numbers, using fancy lingo and stats that I still can‚Äôt wrap my brain around (I still haven‚Äôt understood how you can sell a put you don‚Äôt have for example, that‚Äôs how ignorant I am). But, as the wise men &amp; women say - ignorance is an opportunity to redeem yourself.\n\n5. **Don‚Äôt underestimate all the other players** - Hedge funds, Retirement funds. Whales. They all have different agendas. And their agendas are not yours. The worst mistakes I saw were not acknowledging the special advantages that institutional investors will always have. This is not *cheating*. This is how the market works. You can be a crybaby autist about it, but that‚Äôs how it is (I wrote a bit about some of the advantages even I saw that HF have [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbifwv/a_skeptics_post_can_wsb_win_the_gme_standoff_even/) - me, who knows nothing about investing). Institutional Investors have sentiment trackers, high-speed algorithms, inside information, battle-hardened experience, tricky tactics, etc. You are not going to beat any Hedge Fund of Institutional Investor at a game they invented, made the rules in, and excel at.\n\n6. **Expertise is valuable** - There is a very good reason why finance jobs, especially at Investment Banks, Hedge Funds and Private Equity firms are the best-paid jobs in the world - because they places hire very fucking smart people, who work very fucking hard (7 days a week, 14-hour days), to be better at this than you or I. The expectation that we be as good as them, is like expecting to pop out of your mom‚Äôs womb and run a 100m faster than Usain Bolt without a day‚Äôs training. The reason we don‚Äôt like Hedge Funds or the stock market in general, is it is because it a casino for the wealthy. We are the poor schlubs sitting at the 1 dollar blackjack table, while watching the billionaires in their Tuxedos coming out of their Bentley‚Äôs to play at the million dollar poker tables. From a recent Economist article this week: *‚ÄúEven in America stock market gains have mainly accrued to the rich. The wealthiest 1% owns 56% of the stock market, up from 46% in 1990; the top 10% owns 88% of the market.‚Äù*\n\n7. **The HF didn‚Äôt cheat. They don\'t need to. They hustled** - They invited ignorant newbies to sit at their tables (yes, that‚Äôs us), and then fleeced us of our cash. We are idiots, because we KNEW the hustle was coming and we KNEW the pros were pros, and yet we STILL played against them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Little reminders for myself for next time:**\n\n1. **Accept the risk** - Any money I gamble in this friggin casino I can count as lost.\n2. **If you have no clue, don‚Äôt bet** - I have no clue what a ‚ÄúCalendar Call‚Äù or a ‚ÄúVertical Call‚Äù is. You can bet I won‚Äôt be making that, until I do.\n3. **Losing (preferably a little bit) of money, is a very strong motivation to learn.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd a li‚Äô tip for my fellow autists:\n\n**Don‚Äôt post fucking DDs if you are an ignorant shit.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPositions - Holding 215 AMC (115 bought  (stupidly, and during the hype) @14; 100 bought during a dip @ 8.11)\nHolding 2 GME (1 free from RH, 1 bought at 115)\n1 SPY put 332; EXP 03/31\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFinal final note (for real, this time):\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***If you think the stock market is unfair, you are right.

So silver is also a solar energy play. With Biden taking office, we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil.\n\nPhotovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels.

As such, Silver production is in decline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Chart for you](https://preview.redd.it/jd7j4f5tpgf61.png?width=1314&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bf89b396074924c03685e65bcb4ae1556f7c90e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to conclude the boomer DD:\n\n\\- Inflation is on the rise\n\n\\- Too much money is being printed\n\n\\- Silver outperforms gold\n\n\\- Silver biggest use is industrial use\n\n\\- Silver demand is increasing\n\n\\- Silver supply is dropping\n\n**WSB DD üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to [coingape.com](https://coingape.com) , in order to pull short squeeze of hedge funds (not necessarily JP Morgan), we would need silver to go to $500\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Some tweet they put on their site idk üöÄüöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/6dej6iowpgf61.png?width=1296&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e33a578db6f235c5e14b7d420637ce7936838b6d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, I am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver ( Hello SEC! )\n\nI\'m just saying that I really like SLV stock, and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons. There is also an additional upside of the fact that IF for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely. This is because unlike the GME short squeeze, where GME can issue new stock, a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver, because silver cannot be printed.\n\nAlso, we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the GME short squeeze. Robinhood restricting bought GME shares, brokers being gay etc etc. The difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy, and all the new people who just joined WSB in the daily discussion thread going "Hey guys i\'m a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can I buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you" can also join in. If a short squeeze were to happen, this is how it would happen.\n\n1. People buy SLV stock (not random ETF\'s because they don\'t buy physical silver)\n2. Silver price go up\n3. JP Morgan ANGRY\n4. Robinhood and other brokers experience "temporary outages", "Buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason" , "Limiting SLV shares that can be bought"\n5. WSB and noobs who don\'t know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins. Or since we are in a pandemic order it off eBay or something\n\nBasically, the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way.\n\nWhether or not large banks like JP Morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because it\'s heavily debated and I don\'t know the answer, but what we can CONFIRM is that HEDGE FUNDS are short on silver.\n\nMaybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rebuttals against the bullish case on silver**\n\nI have been drafting this message for a while, and at the same time have skimmed a few anti-silver posts. The common points against this is\n\n\\- One contract is too expensive\n\n\\- People who don\'t know how to trade futures will get stuck with it\n\n\\- Its taking attention away from GME\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*One contract is too expensive*\n\nThe contracts you are referring to are the futures, aka paper silver. There are three ways to buy physical silver\n\n1. But silver futures and take delivery\n2. Buy SLV shares\n3. Buy Silver from jewellers or online sellers\n\nThere are currently around 5 times more contracts for silver in the COMEX markets than there is supply of it. This means that when you buy SLV futures and exercise it, the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who DOES have it. Once we do this, they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market. Companies like TSLA, Samsung and Canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile, because they know that supply is dwindling. People have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too, if you don\'t believe me check for yourself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*People who don\'t know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees*\n\nSee above\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Its taking attention away from GME*\n\nI am not being paid by anyone to write this, i just genuinely see the potential for it. While I do agree that GME is still relevant, it doesn\'t mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios. We shouldn\'t miss out on silver just because we are still in GME. Besides, a SLV squeeze would be much more beneficial than the GME squeeze because of my last point below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Last and most important point - the benefit of a silver price rise**\n\n**When GME prices go up, who benefits? Shareholders, hedge funds who are long GME, banks, etc**\n\n**When BITCOIN moons, who benefits? Banks, rich people, people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it, people who have access to bitcoin wallets, brokers etc.**\n\n**When we blow up stocks like GME and BTC, even though we profit, and even if we bankrupt hedge funds, the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own GME stock.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**BUT WHO OWNS SILVER?**\n\nAlmost every household owns some silver. Whether its\' bars, coins, or religious statues. Poorer countries and places, like Asia and Africa, most households have a small silver chain, a family heirloom, ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket I don\'t know.\n\nIf silver prices moon, money goes to the people, even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver, silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of. If we can get silver back to its FAIR VALUE, through the reasons and HYPOTHETICAL methods I mentioned above, we can not only burn hedge funds, profit for ourselves, but also help poor families.\n\nPoor people don\'t how to set up a brokerage account and buy Gamestonk. Poor people don\'t know how to trade cryptocurrencies. Poor people don\'t have the capital to enter into the stock market. What they DO have is gold and silver (mainly silver).  When they don\'t have the knowledge or ability to buy shares (As proven with the recent influx of people with "What is a broker" kind of questions), they get left out of these massive wealth transfers. Its much easier to say "Buy silver lol" than "Ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs, verify all your information, deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose...."\n\nIf you want to bankrupt hedge funds, don\'t transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long GME. Instead, transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families.\n\nTLDR WSB DD: If silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you. Also silver buying cannot be restricted because you don\'t need a broker to buy silver. (IF YOU ARE READING THIS DITCH ROBINHOOD AND CHANGE BROKERS. IF YOU DON\'T CHANGE BROKRS THEY WILL KEEP DOING THINGS LIKE THIS \\[When you don\'t pay for a product you ARE the product\\])\n\nRegardless or whether or not we take part, silver will get to its fair value. Although it would be faster if we joined.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStocks I like: SLV\n\nStocks I DO NOT LIKE: silver ETF\'s that have paper silver positions\n\nIf you have questions, counterpoints, suggestions or edits message me u/Prestigious_West_524'), ('GME and why do we matter', 'GME and why do we matterI  fling poop and drag my knuckles on the floor.

Now that GME is the dinner  conversation topic of the world, everyone and their moms have an  opinion.  We will be told we don\'t matter.  We don\'t know what we are  doing(probably true. I got into stocks 2 weeks ago).  We should have  sold at the peak.  We should have bought lower.  We shouldn\'t have  gambled.  What people are forgetting is what WE are trying, is to do  better, and be better.  Why kick a guy down when he wants a better  fucking life.  FUCK YOU.\n\nLOOK AT  THE PPL SPENDING THEIR TENDIES TO GIVE BACK.  It\'s our $, let us do what  we want with it.

As most physical businesses are.  See 24 hour fitness.  (I\'ve never  been inside a gym but I read stuff online)  But GME is pivoting.  PAPA  COWEN and the new board members are pivoting to e-commerce.  He\'s  assembling the fucking avengers to the END GAME but this is just getting  started.  GME is transforming just like Netflix when it went from DVDs  to online streaming.  We are the ugly duckling that gets super sexy  after growing pains.\n\nHow about  this for fuuunDamentAls.  Hedge funds being allowed to short a stock  over 100% and nobody comments on how that happened.  Why it happened.   And how SHORTING has INFINITE room to lose.  Keep in mind, they are  sophisticated gamblers with other people\'s money and 401ks.  BUT  according to their calculation it\'s little to no risk.  Because they can  throw more $ at the problem and manipulate the market, they can fix it!   If they can\'t, they want to cry to the media, get the public opinion  on their side, and ask for MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  Why would a  greedy $ machine ask for more oversight?  OH, that\'s because the SEC is  your lapdog and the government will bail you out with tax payer dollars.   SEE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.

Really, it\'s just autistic people posting the exact  confirmation biases that we needed to see.

The little guys, the plebes, the  unsophisticated, etc..  Yet they can\'t decide on how/when to get a  stimmy check to us.  THEY REALLY REALLY CARE (when hedge funds lose  money).  We some how took wallstreet down with $600.  If the stock  market was that fragile, we have BIGGER issues.\n\n\\-Momentum  was killed last week by brokers being held to new collateral  requirements by clearing houses.  Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they\'re  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn\'t  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.\n\n\\-News outlet and controlling the narrative.  How many analysts, journalist, and their rich ~~daddies~~  overlords are framing this as WSB pumping and dumping a meme stock.  WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?  You deplorable sacks of shit who get no enjoyment out of life  other than sucking the souls and money out of people.  You live to see  more zeros in your account and there is a special place in hell for you.\n\n\\-SEC  holding a meeting tonight investigating market manipulation through  social media but no investigative statement on how clearing houses can  magically conjure a rule that halts trading for retail investors.   Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they\'re not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.\n\n\\-How  shorts magically covered their positions but DO NOT have to report their  positions until weeks later.  Lack of immediate transparency gives them  ample time to reposition and multiple options to cover their asses  while blaming us.\n\nAnyways, I could  keep bitching but I just wanted to vent and rally us together.

Well today I want to take some time to add some wrinkles to your smooth brains. This wrinkle is called the Stop Loss and is probably missing from most of you 8,000,000+ wsb subscribers.\n\nI probably need to preface this post since a lot of you probably can‚Äôt focus (or read) long enough to get past this section. I am NOT telling you to sell your GME shares. I think this entire event has been glorious and unprecedented in its cooperation across the world. That being said, I am simply providing information to those people who cannot handle the losses they may be risking by investing in the BANG gang.\n\nMany, okay most of you, are holding GME, NOK, BB, or AMC. With their erratic price movement, you should have an out. I personally don‚Äôt trade without a stop loss, but then again, I am not a diamond-handed ape and like to control my losses.\n\nThis is how a stop loss works in simple terms:\n\n1. monkey buys share for $100 each.\n2. Monkey then creates a sell order, but instead of using ‚Äúlimit‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù, the monkey selects ‚ÄúStop Loss‚Äù or ‚ÄúStop on Quote‚Äù and types in the lowest price they are willing to sell\n3. Confirm order\n\nCongrats, you set up a stop loss and are a savvy trader.\n\n‚ÄúOh, but why would I buy high sell low?‚Äù Well, you can answer to your own god why you bought high. The real reason for entering this order is to prevent further bleeding than you can handle.\n\nIt is impossible to browse WSB without seeing some form of loss porn coupled with ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear no bell‚Äù or ‚ÄúIM NOT FUCKING SELLING.‚Äù That‚Äôs great and all, but for those smaller fish who need to pay rent or are risking their student loans (yeah, you Mr. dental school), I encourage using this safety net.\n\nFirst, figure out what you are comfortable losing. If that is 20%, great use that. If you have GME with an average of $100 per share (not impossible based on today‚Äôs price movement), set your Stop Loss order for $80. Now, if GME drops below $80, congrats you got out and wont risk bleeding down to wherever it ends up. (note: this order is only active during regular trading hours. You are on your own afterhours).\n\n‚ÄúBut Mr. Tacos, what if it bounces back?!‚Äù yeah that happens, but hey this is gambling, nothing is a sure thing. Be safe, invest smart, and always have an exit strategy. If you are a diamond handed ape willing to ride it to $0, may you have a spot reserved in stock-Valhalla (or the WSB hall of losses). If not? Well then, I hope this information helps.\n\n(this is not financial advice)\n\nTL;DR ‚Äì Stop Loss good.

Sure, trading on volatile stocks like the BANG gang isn\'t going to be as effective as on something like SPY. That being said, the idea of "only invest what you are willing to lose" is completely misapplied here. \n\nIf you are will to lose $1000, that does not mean you are limited to investing $1000. How about you invest $5000 and set a stop loss at $4000. Same loss, but much higher potential gains.

These people cheat, lie, and take everything they can get there hands on while we slave working out life‚Äôs away to survive! Then we play there game and they fuck us hard. Honestly between the politics that i don‚Äôt care about. How hard it is to live on a full time job by yourself, the healthcare system. How if your poor it‚Äôs so much harder to afford to eat healthy. Climate change bullshit. God damn Epstein. Corona, a lifetime of living in a world with constant war. Protest and shit in the capital. Like this word is fucked. My life is basically a joke and a meme. Take whatever you want from me I will üíéüíéüíéüíéüñêüñêüñêüñêüñê my 133 shares of GameStop untill i sell 100 for $1000+ and keep the rest because I LIKE THIS STOCK or NEVER sell. At this point all you shorts are wrong even if they illegally stop the squeeze because GameStop has restructured, GameStop has publicity, and GameStop now has a even bigger following. Also the squeeze has not yet been squoze, look at daily short interest, short ladder attacks are real. The games manipulated. If they were not in harms way you wouldn‚Äôt see all the FUD. They would stop talking about if and stop spreading false information about the subreddit. Fuck them. I HATE YOU ALL WITH A BURNING PASSION!! I CAN LOSE THOUSANDS JUST TO MAKE YOU LOSE MILLIONS DAY BY DAY. THIS. IS.

I am not a financial  advisor.  Do your own due diligence.  This is for entertainment purposes  only.\n\nLately,  I\'ve felt like we don\'t have a voice and don\'t matter but I want to  remind all us apes that we are retarded together.  We will win TOGETHER  and we will HOLD together.  Could be days, weeks, or months.  Longer  than any of our attention spans.  So they will use TIME against us.  BUT  time is on our side.\n\nThis is  psychological warfare against us to make us DOUBT ourselves and what we  WILL accomplish.  We will remain retarded longer then they can remain  solvent.  They bleed interest each day.  A stock\'s value is based upon  what we place on it.  See TSLA for reference.  WE LIKE THE FUCKING  STOCK.  If my stock is worth 5k to me, I WILL HOLD for 5 fucking K.  WHO  are you to tell us how to perceive VALUE?  OHHHHH, you\'re an expert who  got caught with your dick in the cookie jar (thx louis rossman).   SHORTING 130-140% of a stock.  These hedgies aren\'t infallible.  Just  well connected and well resourced.  As long as we own shares that they  NEED, we have time on our side.  Even though it will not feel like it.\n\nObligatory, don\'t invest what you can\'t lose.\n\nWe  cannot let the hedgies deter us.  Now that GME is the dinner  conversation topic of the world, everyone and their moms have an  opinion.  We will be told we don\'t matter.  We don\'t know what we are  doing(probably true. I got into stocks 2 weeks ago).  We should have  sold at the peak.  We should have bought lower.  We shouldn\'t have  gambled.  What people are forgetting is what WE are trying, is to do  better, and be better.  Why kick a guy down when he wants a better  fucking life.  FUCK YOU.\n\nLOOK AT  THE PPL SPENDING THEIR TENDIES TO GIVE BACK.  It\'s our $, let us do what  we want with it.  If a hedgie can irresponsibly short a stock over  100%, why can\'t we take a CALCULATED risk?  BUUUT funDamentAls.   Gamestop is a dying company.  The former business model of GME is dying.   As most physical businesses are.  See 24 hour fitness.  (I\'ve never  been inside a gym but I read stuff online)  But GME is pivoting.  PAPA  COWEN and the new board members are pivoting to e-commerce.  He\'s  assembling the fucking avengers to the END GAME but this is just getting  started.  GME is transforming just like Netflix when it went from DVDs  to online streaming.  We are the ugly duckling that gets super sexy  after growing pains.\n\nHow about  this for fuuunDamentAls.  Hedge funds being allowed to short a stock  over 100% and nobody comments on how that happened.  Why it happened.   And how SHORTING has INFINITE room to lose.  Keep in mind, they are  sophisticated gamblers with other people\'s money and 401ks.  BUT  according to their calculation it\'s little to no risk.  Because they can  throw more $ at the problem and manipulate the market, they can fix it!   If they can\'t, they want to cry to the media, get the public opinion  on their side, and ask for MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  Why would a  greedy $ machine ask for more oversight?  OH, that\'s because the SEC is  your lapdog and the government will bail you out with tax payer dollars.   SEE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  Yet, we are not allowed to exploit the law  of supply and demand.  If the demand exceeds 100% of the supply, the  inherit value ROCKETS.  See RTX cards and AMD chips.  FUCK SCALPERS for  good measure :)\n\nI want to remind  every single one of you, we do matter.  We have NUMBERS on our side.  As  a collective we\'ve already made shorting a topic of conversation at the  political level.  This may not be a monetary victory but it hopefully  is a step in the right direction to a more equal game.  That or hold  your politicians accountable.  You are their constituents.\n\nWe  play out in the open.  We share publicly available information and make  decisions base.  Really, it\'s just autistic people posting the exact  confirmation biases that we needed to see.  It prints $$$$ BRRrrrrr.\n\nLet\'s recap how the odds are stacked against us.\n\n\\-We  are too stupid to be allowed to spend our money.  We need government  intervention to "protect us".  The little guys, the plebes, the  unsophisticated, etc..  Yet they can\'t decide on how/when to get a  stimmy check to us.  THEY REALLY REALLY CARE (when hedge funds lose  money).  We some how took wallstreet down with $600.  If the stock  market was that fragile, we have BIGGER issues.\n\n\\-Momentum  was killed last week by brokers being held to new collateral  requirements by clearing houses.  Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they\'re  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn\'t  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.\n\n\\-News outlet and controlling the narrative.  How many analysts, journalist, and their rich ~~daddies~~  overlords are framing this as WSB pumping and dumping a meme stock.  WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?  You deplorable sacks of shit who get no enjoyment out of life  other than sucking the souls and money out of people.  You live to see  more zeros in your account and there is a special place in hell for you.\n\n\\-SEC  holding a meeting tonight investigating market manipulation through  social media but no investigative statement on how clearing houses can  magically conjure a rule that halts trading for retail investors.   Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they\'re not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.\n\n\\-How  shorts magically covered their positions but DO NOT have to report their  positions until weeks later.  Lack of immediate transparency gives them  ample time to reposition and multiple options to cover their asses  while blaming us.\n\nAnyways, I could  keep bitching but I just wanted to vent and rally us together.  We took  a mad beating. I just wanted to let you beautiful online strangers that  you aren\'t alone.  GME has transcended and has evolved into a movement.\n\nWhat  does GME mean to me?  A down-payment to a home for my family and I.  My  wife and I are expecting our first kid.  I\'m risking something I can  lose... for a better future.\n\nWhat does GME mean to you?\n\nTLDR; We fucking matter.  We are going to be the catalyst of change. HOLD SHARES.

Well today I want to take some time to add some wrinkles to your smooth brains. This wrinkle is called the Stop Loss and is probably missing from most of you 8,000,000+ wsb subscribers.\n\nI probably need to preface this post since a lot of you probably can‚Äôt focus (or read) long enough to get past this section. I am NOT telling you to sell your GME shares. I think this entire event has been glorious and unprecedented in its cooperation across the world. That being said, I am simply providing information to those people who cannot handle the losses they may be risking by investing in the BANG gang.\n\nMany, okay most of you, are holding GME, NOK, BB, or AMC. With their erratic price movement, you should have an out. I personally don‚Äôt trade without a stop loss, but then again, I am not a diamond-handed ape and like to control my losses.\n\nThis is how a stop loss works in simple terms:\n\n1. monkey buys share for $100 each.\n2. Monkey then creates a sell order, but instead of using ‚Äúlimit‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù, the monkey selects ‚ÄúStop Loss‚Äù or ‚ÄúStop on Quote‚Äù and types in the lowest price they are willing to sell\n3. Confirm order\n\nCongrats, you set up a stop loss and are a savvy trader.\n\n‚ÄúOh, but why would I buy high sell low?‚Äù Well, you can answer to your own god why you bought high. The real reason for entering this order is to prevent further bleeding than you can handle.\n\nIt is impossible to browse WSB without seeing some form of loss porn coupled with ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear no bell‚Äù or ‚ÄúIM NOT FUCKING SELLING.‚Äù That‚Äôs great and all, but for those smaller fish who need to pay rent or are risking their student loans (yeah, you Mr. dental school), I encourage using this safety net.\n\nFirst, figure out what you are comfortable losing. If that is 20%, great use that. If you have GME with an average of $100 per share (not impossible based on today‚Äôs price movement), set your Stop Loss order for $80. Now, if GME drops below $80, congrats you got out and wont risk bleeding down to wherever it ends up. (note: this order is only active during regular trading hours. You are on your own afterhours).\n\n‚ÄúBut Mr. Tacos, what if it bounces back?!‚Äù yeah that happens, but hey this is gambling, nothing is a sure thing. Be safe, invest smart, and always have an exit strategy. If you are a diamond handed ape willing to ride it to $0, may you have a spot reserved in stock-Valhalla (or the WSB hall of losses). If not? Well then, I hope this information helps.\n\n(this is not financial advice)\n\nTL;DR ‚Äì Stop Loss good. Max Loss Bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Your comments reveal how little a lot of you know about trading. Sure, trading on volatile stocks like the BANG gang isn\'t going to be as effective as on something like SPY. That being said, the idea of "only invest what you are willing to lose" is completely misapplied here. \n\nIf you are will to lose $1000, that does not mean you are limited to investing $1000.

As you\'ve noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.\n\nI\'ve held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I\'m down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don\'t fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.\n\nNow get these points through your thick head:\n\n    \n* **This is a fucking volatile stock.** \n\nThis is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while, üåàüêª keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger.

Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy‚Äôs Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aim√© of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That\'s 12x bagger and I\'m being very conservative here.\n\n**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it\'s true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the üåàüêªs**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.\n\nMOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play\n\nAlso, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment\n    \n    \n\n* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. \n\nI know you\'re used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it\'s still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen\'s success, which I don\'t doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\\reward is massively skewed to the upside\n\nIf you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it\'s unbearable for you, but ultimately you\'ll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream "WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ"\n\n**Positions:** some Apr 40c, some Apr 200c and a shitload of Jan 2023 950c.

Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy\'s parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it\'s a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reason 1:** Everyone\'s a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there\'s more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.\n\nRemember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we\'ve ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed\'s finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I\'ve seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.\n\nThis is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.\n\nThere will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.\n\n**Reason 2:** APHA\'s balance sheet is robust. Doesn\'t show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials)\n\nInstead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone\'s spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I\'ve been to my local weed shop in CA and it\'s fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.\n\nEven though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA\'s largest expenses are "unusual expenses," implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. \n\n**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.\n\nYup. Nixon\'s law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people\'s apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn\'t happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a "tough on crime" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it\'s not truly legal.\n\nPosition: 40 shares of APHA high as a motherfucking kite.'), ("Pass the bong and gather round, bros!

Alright, apes, it\'s been a great few days being able to throw a dart at a wall of weed stocks and no matter where it sticks, you make money.  It\'s been a great run.  But if you\'re going to expand the acreage of your jungle and the amount of lady gorillas you earn the right to mate with, you gotta start thinking a bit.  And that means - hear me out - thinking of how the hell you plan on getting out of SNDL alive.  And yes, I realize I\'m saying this right after it spiked almost a hundo percent in the last 24 hours.  Look, I was playing it, too.  I grabbed some 2/19 3c\'s and a shit ton of 1/22 1.5c\'s on Tuesday.  I also got out of both of those today, though not as high up as I could have.  If you check my history, you\'ll see I even said I was goingt to eye a re-entry.  Then the market took a giant dump and gave me that entry, but I passed on it because I had done some research by that point.  Whatever, profit\'s profit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\'s the TL:DR:  It\'s basically a penny stock that\'s gotten pumped to hell.  But the smart ape realizes when something has gone too mainstream and gets out of the way before the bulldozers wipe out his trees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey, I love shoving a share price around a bit as much as the next guy, I ain\'t gonna talk shit about that.  But it seems like nobody has an exit strategy for this, and I\'m starting to see a lot of really stupid shit about Holding to 42.69 and all the other ridiculous bullshit from people who clearly don\'t even know what they fuck they\'ve invested in that the GME Gibbons fell for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Here\'s the reality of SNDL:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe company was on the verge of bankruptcy around Thanksgiving, they have no other markets other than Canada, which is ridiculously oversaturated with weed to the point that wholesale prices are less than a dollar a gram.  And they recently got forced to admit that their product fails to meet THC content requirements.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn case you\'re wondering what that means, it means they sell skunkweed that they cut with paper and sawdust to make it cheaper.  They sell garbage.  And everyone knows it - their brand is associated with low quality crap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlus, they actively solicited us to buy their stock to drive up the price, then diluted it to fuck with a billion share offering.  Now, to their credit, this not only enabled them to become debt free, but also up their marketing budget and spend some time trying to create a brand.  Don\'t get too excited, fucking Sam\'s Choice at Wal-Mart is a brand, too, doesn\'t mean you should stick a chub of their ground beef up your rectum.  By reason of them selling skunkweed, their margins lag well behind that of their competitors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking at their financials, they\'ve got 615 million in cash laying around.  That\'s pretty good - except  they\'re a company that burns 250 million a quarter.  Which means they\'re going to dilute the fuck out of everyone again next month.  They\'ve got no exposure to the US market, but had no problem dropping "rumors" that they were going to break in to the US market through licensing deals - which turned out to be 1 pot shop in Bellingham, Washington.  They have no real expansion plan anywhere in the world, for that matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# B...bu.....bu.bu....BUT NRDRAGE!  Stonk go up !  Look at it!  SNDL to the moon!  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ ).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah, I know.  It\'s fucking crazy to talk shit about a stock when it\'s seemingly mid flight.  But here I am anyways.  Not to talk you out of the weed party - you should totally keep playing that for all it\'s worth - but rather to get people to see that they\'ve probably outgrown skunkweed now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook, the reason this thing mooned is because it was like a dollar.  Hell, it was 13 cents not too far back.  With a stock worth a dollar, it\'s easy to get a lot of other apes to throw a couple of bananas at it for the lulz.  It\'s easy to shove around a penny stock with an extra 10 bucks you have laying around from another trade somewhere.  But as the price goes up, so too goes up the perceived cost of entering.  I can make a strong (unassailable, in fact), argument that $APHA at $25 is cheaper than SNDL at 3.25.  But people are conditioned to like smaller numbers.  Unfortunately, as the GME Gibbons learned, eventually you run out of buyers, and then things go tits up real fast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the Prophet Biggie Smalls once said, Mo\' Money Equals Mo\' Problems.  We all know this equation to be true.  And here you are, sitting on bags of bananas you didn\'t know you were gonna have a week ago thanks to some stonk you hadn\'t heard of before yesterday.  You don\'t think you\'ve got a problem, but you do.  Because those bags of bananas aren\'t edible until you turn them in to the bank for real cash.  If you\'re sitting on  bananas from the gold standard of the weed world (that would be, $TLRY), you\'re resting pretty easy that no other ape is gonna come by and steal your bananas.  There are gonna be lots of bananas to go around, and mostly we\'re just taking bananas from fools who think their bananas will be less later.  But you don\'t have that with SNDL.  All the bananas are currently sitting with people who think the bananas will go higher.  You can\'t all be right, especially when there are billions of bananas, and now your grandparents are starting to buy bananas because some Boomer on CNBC told them it would make their dick bigger and their friends think they were cooler.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Again, I\'m not telling you to leave the party\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, if you recall your dorm room years, the best pizza you could afford was the Tony\'s school lunchroom style shit for a dollar.  Then you managed to  hide a few bucks from the people who collect your student loans, and you upgraded to Domino\'s.  Maybe by now you\'re ordering from a local joint that makes it\'s own dough in house and the sauce is made with the love of an old Italian grandma who accidentally dips her sagging tiddies into the pot 3 times while making it.  That just makes it taste better.  That\'s science.  But I digress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point is, you can get better weed now.  You don\'t have to smoke the skunk.  So before you get the rug pulled out from beneath you and are stuck investing in shitty penny stocks again, maybe you should elevate your enterprise.  Let\'s take a look at your options:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Canopy Growth\n\nYou could go with $CGC.  They not only sell higher quality weed, but are an established brand and also sell oils and shit to those hippie fucks who still think Burning Man isn\'t just a brogrammer beatfest and go to an acupuncturist to enhance their "luck".  They\'ve captured that all important 65+ stoner demographic by marketing their shit as a cure for seizures, cataracts, and dry vag, so they\'ve got a lot of revenue.  They\'ve also had a much more muted rise this week because they just haven\'t been on everybody\'s lips, which means they\'ve got a lot of room to run.  The downside here is they burn almost as much cash as SNDL, but they\'ve also got more bullets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Aurora\n\nIf you go with $ACB, you\'re going with a company that\'s already gone through its "shady as fuck" stage and has re-emerged healthy from it.  You\'re also not only getting on weed, but the DIY urban chicken farmer types who want to grow their own weed.  They, too, have had a strong run, but have a lot more runway than most because they\'ve actually got a really strong path to dominance in the US market once it opens up to them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Organigram:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook, if your dick is still getting hard at the thought of playing a low dollar stonk or you\'ve only got 28 dollars to invest, you could do a lot worse.  They\'ve got strong branding, large growth potential, a management structure that doesn\'t seem to act shady, and they\'ve run almost as well as the other new generation of meme stonks, but lagged back enough because nobody can fucking rmeember their name to where they can rubber band a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Tilray and Aphria:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m combining these because they\'re inexorably joined at the hip (or should be, more on that later) because the two of them are merging.  For those who don\'t know, sometime in Q2, every share of $APHA you own will turn into .833 shares of $TLRY.  Even though APHA is the one buying out TLRY.    This is basically the gold standard of weed stonkery.  When you start investing in these, you know you\'re a real investor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere\'s the interesting thing with these guys, though.  Even though APHIA should be just slightly trailing behind TLRY in terms of stock price, it\'s currently trading at less than half.  With TLRY sitting at 73 a share as I write this, APHA should be at just over $60.  But it\'s at 29.  Now, obviously, this means that TLRY has a lot more momentum, and some of that is due to the fact that there\'s a mini (don\'t flog me for using the word, but it\'s true) short squeeze going on with that one, which has turned it into such a strong momentum play.  But APHA, by virtue of actual math, needs to be within about 17% of TLRY\'s price.  Which means APHA either needs to moon dramatically, or TLRY needs to fall precipitously.  Now either of those things could happen, but the momentum of TLRY is hard to stop, which means it\'s more likely that APHA rubber bands to catch up to it in the coming months.  Even if TLRY does falter, that means APHA still has to come up a bit to meet it.  Making APHA kind of a "can\'t go tits up" situation.  TLRY also has the benefit of having enough market cap to where fund bois will buy into it, whereas SNDL is too small to meet most of their requirements.    Which can further propel TLRY (and thus, drag APHA with it).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the interesting things that\'s been happening with this pair is that the order books, even though they should mirror one another, have completely inverted from one another numerous times in the last couple of days.  This, of course, was a bull flag for TLRY every time it happened, leaving APHA to compensate to try and catch back up shortly thereafter.  It\'s really easy money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFundamentally, these guys have one HUUUUUUUGE advantage over the others:  They secured the UK distribution, and now have the inside track to be the supplier for the rest of the Europoors across the pond who need to smoke a bond to help forget all the things wrong with them.  And if you don\'t think they won\'t be able to leverage that to be the front runners out of the gate when the US opens for business, then you definitely ain\'t black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Or, you can just stay where you are and do the  üíéüëê thing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAsk the $GME Gibbons how well that worked out for them.  The ones still holding that stonk are like that one dude sitting at the edge of the bar of the Viper Room, still rocking his mullet and chain wallet, just convinced that Warrant and Slaughter are going to ring in the glory days of hair metal once more and that Queensryche is going to start selling out stadiums again.  It\'s just sad.  You\'re flying right now, but a rug is gonna get pulled out from under you and then you\'re gonna have your own daily thread where you reassure yourselves that it\'s gonna be OK and that you\'re gonna ride it to a thousand one day.  Lots of us (myself included) made a fuck ton of money on GME.  And we\'ve made a fuck ton on SNDL and the rest of the Weedies this week.  But there are always people who Melvin it and hang on to their position too long and get stuck.  That\'s gonna be a lot of you, but you shouldn\'t let it be you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL:DR:  Smart apes should look at their much bigger pile of bananas from SNDL while you\'re way ahead and upgrade them to plantains before the other apes.  Plaintains equals breeding with better apes, not low quality apes that cannibalize fellow apes and give ape diseases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my love\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Chad Dickens\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1:  I forgot to list my positions\n\nCGC - None\n\nACB - None\n\nOGI - 10,000 shares @ $4.23, 1000 1/22 5c, 500 2/19 7.5c\n\nTLRY:  20,000 shares @ 18.74, 100 2/12 65c, 500 2/19 65c, 500 2/12 42c, 5000 6/18 43c\n\nAPHA:  500 2/19 26c, 500 2/19 25c, 5000 7/16 30c\n\nSNDL:  Opted out today'), ('To all my fellow degenerates, What stock was your all time biggest winner?', "To all my fellow degenerates, What stock was your all time biggest winner?I don't know about you guys, but I started trading as a socially acceptable substitute for my crippling gambling addiction. it was supposed to be a temporary thing, but now 3 years later it's how I make a living.

GME was too beautiful to remain a passive reader. Sure, lob your ‚ÄúHF shill‚Äù comments (bring it retards) but then hear me out if you like $$$$ (‚Ä¶can‚Äôt be sure with half you guys‚Ä¶)\n\nThe perfect stock has been right in front of your eyes and it‚Äôs so obvious it hurts. AMC‚Äôs ugly sister, CNK, is strapped to an Elon Musk rocket and is just begging for someone to press the big shiny launch button.\n\nThis is a rare one-two punch where both the technical &amp; fundamental pictures look great.\n\n**Punchline Upfront:** CNK currently trades at $20. CNK has upside to $40. These are levels at which it traded only 18 months ago. In fact, CNK traded in a $10 range between $32 and $42 in 2019 with an average price of $37.80\xa0\n\n# Technical: The Ice Cream (The Tendie?)\n\nOK‚Ä¶ Why CNK? Simple: I ran a ‚ÄúMoon Screen‚Äù which looked for:\xa0\n\n1. **High Short Interest** (&gt;20% of floatable shares outstanding)\n2. **Cheap Stock** (Hasn‚Äôt Had A ‚ÄúGME moment‚Äù, low 1 year return, fundamentals etc.)\n3. **Small company** with lower trading volume (both mean more upside)\n4. **Liquid** (i.e. a lot) **call options** (fuck puts) to minimize trading costs (i.e. maximize tendies)\xa0\n\nand CNK got spit out as the clear standout. If this feels familiar, it‚Äôs because most of these criteria were based off GME before Cohen was announced to the board. That‚Äôs right: I simply want to acknowledge the salivating technical set up and it‚Äôs similarity to GME pre-orbit.\xa0\n\n# Fundamental: The Cherry on Top (The Tendie Sauce?)\n\nCOVID has changed the world in lasting, meaningful ways and CNK‚Äôs theatre footprint is uniquely positioned to benefit from these changes. Pent-up demand for out-of-home entertainment combined with a backlog of strong film content creates a strong backdrop for Cinemark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Reason 1: Suburban + Lower-Income Tilt Will Outperform in Post-COVID World\n\n* TL;DR: Suburban Footprint = Actually Really Fucking Good (For Many Reasons)\n\nCinemark‚Äôs theatre footprint is slated toward suburban locations. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, here is their COO/CFO Sean Gamble (really his name lol): ‚Äú\\[CNK\\] tends to be more suburban, while \\[AMC‚Äôs\\] circuit tends to be a bit more metro.‚Äù **This is what gets me excited.** While we still don‚Äôt fully know the extent COVID had on people living in dense, urban areas like NYC, the preliminary read is that it has accelerated the move to the suburbs. This helps CNK for two reasons:\n\n1. Suburban locations have lower rent\n2. Suburban locations stand to benefit from higher demand based off people moving to the suburbs\n\nJust think for a second. On average, suburbs have less fun shit to do. Although going to the movies might not sound that exciting in a city given all the great alternatives, going to the movies might be ‚Äúthe only game in town‚Äù in suburbia\n\nIn addition, Cinemark operates primarily in smaller cities and suburban areas, meaning lower-income where customers are more price-sensitive. Cinemark‚Äôs customer base also has a higher share of families than AMC/Regal. This also helps CNK:\n\n1. More price sensitive customers =&gt; less ability to create a compelling movie experience at home =&gt; more likely to continue going to the theater\n\n# Reason 2: Better Balance Sheet =&gt; Longer Runway to Weather ‚ÄúCOVID Storm‚Äù\n\n* TL;DR: Lots Money + Low Debt + Low Rent = I Can Wait Out COVID\n\nStrong balance sheet (850mm in cash sitting there; low leverage of 2x-3x vs. AMC at 8.5x).\xa0\n\nIndustry-leading Operations with FAT margins (23-26% domestic margins; 8.6% ‚Äúfatter‚Äù (i.e. good, fat margin = fat tendie) than AMC)\n\nLow rent obligations. New/updated theaters. Nice operational runway to weather the COVID storm.\n\n# Reason 3: Boost From Dollar Weakness\n\n25% of revs from Latin America. Huge FX headwind here if dollar depreciates (which many people think)\xa0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Valuation/\\*Nerd Shit\\*:**\n\n* Has traded historically at 6.5-8.5x fwd EBITDA. Conservatively, take low end of range due to sentiment around streaming killing box office sales despite still trading at 8.5x as recently as a few years ago\xa0\n* Full-year 2021 revs will be -50% but by 2022, revs should be back to 2019 (pre-COVID) levels. So, using 2022 lvls is the right forward base to value this thing.\n* EBITDA was \\~750mm in 2019. 50mm haircut for potential covid hiccups puts me at\xa0700mm estimate for 2022 (again, the first ‚Äúnormal‚Äù year given 2021 is already off to shit start). Taking the low-end of the valuation multiple, 6.5x, gives me a price of $38.50 (after dividing by shares outstanding)\n\n**Target Price: $38.50**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Afterthought ‚Äì Takeout Upside:**\n\n* Streaming service (AMZN, NFLX, DIS) bundling subscriptions with theatre access might serve as a competitive differentiator as the content wars get increasingly competitive as nearly a dozen streaming services compete for market share. Might snatching up a cinema on the cheap offer an edge via a differentiated experience tack on?\n* Just as restaurants won‚Äôt go away despite everyone having a kitchen, theatres could still have a role, although a changed one that will have to become experience-first, movie-second\n* As long as dates (esp. highschool !) and nights out still happen, having an extra avenue to watch movies besides your couch will still have some demand\n* A physical footprint for AMZN to test VR and reinforce other e-commerce services\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes/Links:**\n\n**Sean Gamble** \\- *Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer*\n\n&gt;"And in terms of our overlap, it really varies based on the market and just what you consider overlap based on distance. In general, it\'s pretty small, I would say, estimate less than 20%. You just consider our market shares, that can kind of show that it\'s only a small portion in. **We generally tend to be more suburban, while their circuit tends to be a bit more metro**. So it\'s a limited overlap."\n\nCNK Breaks Higher After 20:\n\n* [https://stocknews.com/news/cnk-the-bullish-case-for-cinemark-holdings-cnk/](https://stocknews.com/news/cnk-the-bullish-case-for-cinemark-holdings-cnk/)\n\nTakeover Makes Sense Links:\n\n* [https://fortune.com/2020/05/11/amazon-amc-theatres-acquisition-buyout/](https://fortune.com/2020/05/11/amazon-amc-theatres-acquisition-buyout/)\n* [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-film-breakingviews-idUSKBN28W0YM](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-film-breakingviews-idUSKBN28W0YM)'), ('Amazon Doubles Down on Grocery', 'Amazon Doubles Down on GroceryAmazon is aggressively investing in the retail grocery business with the goal of operating 2,000 retail stores in the US blended between Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh.

Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy‚Äôs Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aim√© of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That\'s 12x bagger and I\'m being very conservative here.\n\n**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it\'s true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the üåàüêªs**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.\n\nMOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play\n\nAlso, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment\n    \n    \n\n* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. \n\nI know you\'re used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it\'s still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen\'s success, which I don\'t doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\\reward is massively skewed to the upside\n\nIf you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it\'s unbearable for you, but ultimately you\'ll be fucking loaded.

Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed\'s finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I\'ve seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.\n\nThis is the new reality we live with.

Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.\n\n**Reason 2:** APHA\'s balance sheet is robust.

But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone\'s spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I\'ve been to my local weed shop in CA and it\'s fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.\n\nEven though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA\'s largest expenses are "unusual expenses," implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. \n\n**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.\n\nYup. Nixon\'s law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people\'s apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn\'t happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a "tough on crime" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it\'s not truly legal.\n\nPosition: 40 shares of APHA high as a motherfucking kite.'), ('To all my fellow degenerates, What stock was your all time biggest winner?', "To all my fellow degenerates, What stock was your all time biggest winner?I don't know about you guys, but I started trading as a socially acceptable substitute for my crippling gambling addiction. it was supposed to be a temporary thing, but now 3 years later it's how I make a living.

Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy‚Äôs Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aim√© of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That\'s 12x bagger and I\'m being very conservative here.\n\n**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it\'s true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the üåàüêªs**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.\n\nMOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play\n\nAlso, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment\n    \n    \n\n* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. \n\nI know you\'re used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it\'s still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen\'s success, which I don\'t doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\\reward is massively skewed to the upside\n\nIf you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it\'s unbearable for you, but ultimately you\'ll be fucking loaded.

A comparison with AMC + OthersHey everyone,\n\nI\'ll start off by saying this is not financial advice, do you baby. I\'ll also say I\'m NOT an expert. I had some experience trading before the GME hype, mainly in ETFs, and I\'ve taken Finance courses in college, but that\'s it. \n\nIn any case, I noticed how weirdly correlated the GME Volume and Price were as I watched my gambling money wash away. But that was purely anecdotal. So I wrote a simple script to pull the Volume and Price of 10 stocks, including GME and AMC, every 60 seconds or so. [This was pulling directly from Yahoo! Finance, here\'s GME as an example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/). The script was just looking for the Volume and Price on each stock\'s page. The tickers I chose are:\n\n* AMC\n* ATVI\n* GM\n* GME\n* JPM\n* SNDL\n* SNOW\n* TSLA\n* UPS\n* V\n\n\nThe criteria was just "fairly popular stocks", so if you all have suggestions of other stocks you\'d want to see, feel free to comment.\n\n\nI left this script running from 1:47 PM until 7:02 PM, which gave me a total of 210 observations per stock. The scrape failed twice, once for GME and once for ATVI, so I have 209 observations for those.\n\n\nWhat I found was surprising to me, but I am not savvy enough to know if this is a "sign" of anything. So I\'m leaving it up to you apes. [Here\'s an album with the Regression Analysis results from each of those tickers](https://imgur.com/a/U7myXa2). You\'ll notice that the R^2 for GME is off the charts, at 90.7%. The second highest is TSLA, with 70.9%, followed by UPS, at 68.5%. \n Here\'s a general definition of R^2 : \n&gt;R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.\n\nHere are the R^2 values for all 10 stocks (all in the album above):\n\n* AMC: 0.6766\n* ATVI: 0.579\n* GM: 0.0012\n* GME: 0.907\n* JPM: 0.6203\n* SNDL: 0.3488\n* SNOW: 0.0948\n* TSLA: 0.7087\n* UPS: 0.6852\n* V: 0.39\n\n\nI believe this is telling us that there is an extremely strong correlation between the Volume movement and the Price movement, so as the volume goes up, price goes up, as the volume goes down, price goes down. This relationship is also much much stronger than in any other stock. So what can/does this mean? I cannot conclude if this is shady or not, but with everything else going on (weird sub behavior, media blitz, RH being ass), I can\'t help but think this is odd. And my point here is not to claim I\'ve made some ground-breaking discovery, I\'m looking to use the data we have available to better assess my GME position. My current "reasoning" for holding is that there\'s a lot of "weird" things going on and each one is getting brushed off individually as "maybe it\'s this, maybe it\'s that". The point of this post is to add to that weird pile (what your wife\'s bf calls you).\n\nPS: I understand this is an overly simplistic model, with one variable. I also understand my observations are from one day and the sample size is not large enough to make perfect conclusions.\n\n#####EDIT: If anyone knows a safe, **anonymous**, way of sharing this data, I\'m happy to post it'), ('üå≥ The case for Canopy Growth (CGC): THC DRINKS üå≥', "üå≥ The case for Canopy Growth (CGC): THC DRINKS üå≥Imagine you have the main ingredient to any beverage containing alcohol and there are only ~5 major  competitors in the world (who have the right connections).

A comparison with AMC + OthersHey everyone,\n\nI\'ll start off by saying this is not financial advice, do you baby. I\'ll also say I\'m NOT an expert. I had some experience trading before the GME hype, mainly in ETFs, and I\'ve taken Finance courses in college, but that\'s it. \n\nIn any case, I noticed how weirdly correlated the GME Volume and Price were as I watched my gambling money wash away. But that was purely anecdotal. So I wrote a simple script to pull the Volume and Price of 10 stocks, including GME and AMC, every 60 seconds or so. [This was pulling directly from Yahoo! Finance, here\'s GME as an example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/). The script was just looking for the Volume and Price on each stock\'s page. The tickers I chose are:\n\n* AMC\n* ATVI\n* GM\n* GME\n* JPM\n* SNDL\n* SNOW\n* TSLA\n* UPS\n* V\n\n\nThe criteria was just "fairly popular stocks", so if you all have suggestions of other stocks you\'d want to see, feel free to comment.\n\n\nI left this script running from 1:47 PM until 7:02 PM, which gave me a total of 210 observations per stock. The scrape failed twice, once for GME and once for ATVI, so I have 209 observations for those.\n\n\nWhat I found was surprising to me, but I am not savvy enough to know if this is a "sign" of anything. So I\'m leaving it up to you apes. [Here\'s an album with the Regression Analysis results from each of those tickers](https://imgur.com/a/U7myXa2). You\'ll notice that the R^2 for GME is off the charts, at 90.7%. The second highest is TSLA, with 70.9%, followed by UPS, at 68.5%. \n Here\'s a general definition of R^2 : \n&gt;R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.\n\nHere are the R^2 values for all 10 stocks (all in the album above):\n\n* AMC: 0.6766\n* ATVI: 0.579\n* GM: 0.0012\n* GME: 0.907\n* JPM: 0.6203\n* SNDL: 0.3488\n* SNOW: 0.0948\n* TSLA: 0.7087\n* UPS: 0.6852\n* V: 0.39\n\n\nI believe this is telling us that there is an extremely strong correlation between the Volume movement and the Price movement, so as the volume goes up, price goes up, as the volume goes down, price goes down. This relationship is also much much stronger than in any other stock. So what can/does this mean? I cannot conclude if this is shady or not, but with everything else going on (weird sub behavior, media blitz, RH being ass), I can\'t help but think this is odd. And my point here is not to claim I\'ve made some ground-breaking discovery, I\'m looking to use the data we have available to better assess my GME position. My current "reasoning" for holding is that there\'s a lot of "weird" things going on and each one is getting brushed off individually as "maybe it\'s this, maybe it\'s that". The point of this post is to add to that weird pile (what your wife\'s bf calls you).\n\nPS: I understand this is an overly simplistic model, with one variable. I also understand my observations are from one day and the sample size is not large enough to make perfect conclusions.\n\n#####EDIT: If anyone knows a safe, **anonymous**, way of sharing this data, I\'m happy to post it')], '2021-02-12': [], '2021-02-13': [], '2021-02-14': [], '2021-02-15': [], '2021-02-16': [('AMD strong upside for this week.', 'AMD strong upside for this week.I honestly should have posted this last week because the trade is already in progress, but there is probably still time:\n\n**The DD:**\n\nAMD has strong upside for this week.

This is very important because this stock has tried to form a golden cross 2 times previously and failed to do so within the past few weeks. However, this time it has formed the cross and it\'s continuing to go.\n   3. RSI is continuing to trend up, indicating there is still gas for positive price action.\n   4.

On the technical side, we can see that it\'s starting to go up.\n\nOverall, the 9th would have really been a good time to enter the trade because most of the elevating factors had already formed.

On the MACD, when the **green bar goes from a dark green to a light green just sell the stock.** The simple view is this: dark green means strong bullish, light green means it\'s reversing to bearish. Dark red means bearish. Light red means reversing to bullish. Obviously this is overly simplified and subject to exceptions - but it\'s the general rule and if you know it you\'re better off than if you don\'t know anything at all.\n2. If you want to stay in longer (because obviously none of this is guaranteed) you can wait until the price moves close to the 9-day moving average. Once it moves under that then I\'d take all my money off the table. \n\nI use technicals as a piece of trading stocks, but I tend to never base an entire decision on trading stocks. Charts are useful because they give me more information and help me make decisions based on what is actually happening in the market. Essentially, they prevent me from making emotional decisions and allow me to think in a cool and collected way when I trade.\n\nDo with this what you will.

Ape gang professor Flux here with another heater post. You may know me from my AT&amp;T DD post which taught you how to follow unusual options flow to make some coin, or from my Hut 8 DD post which taught you how to make money using financial arbitrage. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nToday, we‚Äôre going to be learning how to identify optimal entry and exit prices for our trades, by analyzing simple charts and spotting trends. This will be done using the chart for my favourite ticker, AMD. **To all you illiterate, paint-huffing apes who dropped outta highschool and don‚Äôt like learning, I‚Äôve attached a TLDR at the end of the post which tells you which contracts to buy to get some free money**. Let‚Äôs get to it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Building The Foundation**\nTo begin, let‚Äôs take a look at the [AMD one day chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/X5hkIw6s/), and see if we notice anything odd, or unusual.\n\nDo you see anything in particular? Does anything jump out at you? No? [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1DzmPafE/)\n\nStill nothing? If you still don't notice anything, that‚Äôs fine, these patterns can be difficult to spot initially. [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uHY32HCB/)\n\nAs you can see from the final chart, for the past year, AMD has traded within very tight, specific ranges. I have highlighted these areas on the chart using the pink boxes. As we can tell; \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Box #1)** Starting from mid February to mid April, AMD traded within a 10$ range, between $39 and $49. It started at 49$, went down to 39$, back up to 49$, down to 40$, before once again going back up to 49$, where it then smashed through the top of our current trading range, creating a new range.\n- **Box #2)** Now, starting from mid April, going all the way until earnings in August, AMD traded within a 10$ range **again**, between $49 and $59. This range was extremely tight and pronounced, bouncing from the bottom of the channel up to the top of the channel **seven** times throughout its lifetime, before smashing through the top of the channel again.\n- **Box #3)** August through December. $74 to 87$ channel. This range was slightly messier, but still pronounced nonetheless. 6 clean bounces. Smash through the top into our new range.\n- **Box #4)** This is where our most recent range lies, with an $85 bottom and a 95$ top. We haven‚Äôt surged out of this range in either direction, so it is safe to assume we are still trading within this range. **How can we use this information to our advantage?**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Applying our Knowledge**\n\nTo summarize our findings from above, for the past year, AMD has consistently traded within a predefined range before surging higher and entering a newer, higher range. These ranges have held and contained **27 different bounces without breaking**. Only one single trade has bounced lower than a given range, but it recovered within hours. **Twenty seven times, this thesis has held true, so why the fuck would it be different on the 28th**?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, I assume most of you glue sniffers know how we can use this information to our advantage. We know that AMD trades within a tight range. We know that we are currently within the $85-$95 range. We coincidentally also happen to be sitting right at 85$. As a result, we know that it is **extremely** likely that a bounce off of $85 is going to take place.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince we know that $85 is likely a bottom, and a bounce is likely going to take place, we can enter a monthly position here and make some awesome money. Personally, I picked up some 03/19 90Cs, as well as some 04/16 95Cs. And just like that, we managed to catch the literal bottom of a trade, and have the opportunity to make some free money. We can also use our findings to know when to exit our trade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Extending our Knowledge**\n\nSince we know we are trading in a channel, we also know roughly when we can expect to exit our trades! We know that the closer we get to $95, the more likely it is that we will bounce, so we can plan accordingly! Personally, with my 90C, I will look to set a stop loss when AMD is trading around 90$, and manually sell out of the position if AMD manages to break $92/$93.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEven though I‚Äôm a perma bull, I also trade the flipside of the channel as well. If I see AMD trading at $95+, I‚Äôll enter a short position and play the trade on the way down. In this case, I set my stops a little tighter, and keep a greater watch over the trade, since we all know that stocks always go up. Furthermore, since every single channel ended with a blow off top, I don‚Äôt want to get caught in a random blowout and have my options expire worthless. I would rather be conscientious beforehand, and manage my risks accordingly.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nAs you can tell, we can learn a lot about the price movement of a stock by simply looking at its chart. Although the AMD example was painfully simple, it‚Äôs also painfully effective. The best part about all this is, that there are dozens of opportunities like this within the market, simply waiting to be discovered.

Moreover, these charges are bizarre in their diversity of payment networks, banks, and "workarounds" that they use. E.g. Some fraudulent charges are on prepaid gift cards. Some fraudulent charges are on cards that were cancelled, re-sent, and fraudulently charged while still in the mail. Some fraudulent charges posted to cards that were closed (possibly by manipulating a recurring charge mechanism).

Mastercard has been maybe less affected. Some cards have only been used once. One card was never used. Some cards were gift cards. Some cards were cancelled and then charged when a new card was sent but before it was received in the mail.\n\nOne of the most interesting leads is the commenter who said this data is being shared on the dark web and he got that from a source called idx (I have no idea what that is).\n\n**Inferences:**\n\n1. This was probably not an attack on a retailer\'s database because many cards were only used once.\n2. This was probably not an attack on issuing banks since so many were affected. One possible exception is BBVA, since their cards were the victims of the earliest attacks and have been attacked in relatively large quantity.\n3. Likewise, Amex and Visa are more sus than other payment networks, but still not high on the list of suspects.\n4. Some agent that many banks and payment networks use is the most likely culprit. This could be a software vendor. It could be a faulty pipeline to a credit report company (TransUnion, Equifax, Experian) that is adding payment info.\n5. This breach is deep in the system if they are able to hit cards that are ostensibly locked and that are being sent in the mail after the first is cancelled.\n6. Likewise, this is probably not a stale breach from long ago since the fraudsters are able to update their card info to these newly mailed cards.\n7. Many are reporting the same fraudulent charges e.g. coloadtest, Angela Singleton, cfxb, and sumup, so we know these are part of the same breach or set of breaches by the same hacker.\n8. The sumup charges are being sent to Brazil. That\'s a good place for international financial crimes since Brazil does not extradite citizens.\n\n# Suspicions\n\nI think the most likely source of the quantity and variety of breached cards is a deep attack on a "acquirer processor." An acquirer is the bank that handles the transaction for the merchant. Merchant acquirers are the banks that handle transaction risk. Acquirer processors actually process the transactions. Some banks do both, for example, Chase (JPM). Some banks do not, for example Wells Fargo (WFC), hands off the processing to Fiserv (FISV).\n\nA processor is the most likely to be able to generate the kind of data needed for this attack. They would see data from across many banks and payment networks. They would have the ability to collect new card data after reissues and data from cards that were never used. In the 2011 hack of FIS, the hackers were able to get into prepaid debit card (vanilla gift card) data. That hack led to a sustained 35% downturn in the FIS stock price; I suspect a similar breach will do the same.\n\nkrebsonsecurityDOTcom/2013/06/fdic-2011-fis-breach-worse-than-reported/\n\nI collected data below from people who only ever used their card at a very small number of retailers to get a sense of which acquirer processor is most likely to have been hacked, The data is unfortunately not very conclusive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65ya90kc2aj61.png?width=2281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51aadd82f159f196b5ccc483901f4878abcec3b3\n\nThere\'s also a possibility that there were multiple breaches and these attacks are being mixed to obscure the origin.\n\n**I\'m hoping some of you know more about the innards of the payment network system or legacy software that banks use to support it.

These are the top 3 reasons why the sell off will continue. \n\n1. Everyone will die. That‚Äôs right, either due to disease, old age, nuclear war, one too many üçÜ up the üåª, or the always classic üë®üî´ . What happens when they die? They stop spending money. The entire modern economic system is built upon the velocity of money. Once one person stops, another person will stop, which will lead to a massive deflation on par with the Roman empire where everyone stopped farming and buying and instead had üçÜ üåªüë® every single day. \n\n2. Ladders will become the new normal. Have you even been to Lowe‚Äôs or Home Depot recently in Texas? There isn‚Äôt one ladder (or PVC pipe for that matter) in stock. This is a God given sign that all the hedge funds will start using ladders to attack the market. I didn‚Äôt read any of the Ladder Attack posts a few weeks ago, but still upvoted because I imagine that the hedge funds will use that ladder to climb above the NYSE building and drop mortars or some shit like that idk. But I believe this is a sign from God that ladders‚Ä¶ yeah ladders. \n\n3. My peen can no longer get hard. It might be from the constant stress of watching my puts decay into -99% or my straddles also get blown out of the water during high volatility days like today. In any case, I can no longer muster up the courage to see a doctor, because after he asks me about his positions, I get laughed out of the office. But before I leave, he always offers to give me a prostate exam ‚Äúbecause I might like it.‚Äù You bet I accept his offer. \n\nBulls are fukd. SPY $200p March.'), ('The Real Big Short: Passive Investing, Positive Feedback Loops, and The Massive Ark Bubble', 'The Real Big Short: Passive Investing, Positive Feedback Loops, and The Massive Ark Bubbletl;dr: Long Dated ARKK puts and/or debit spreads.\n\n"Shut up gay bear!" "Don\'t short meme stocks!" "Cathy will bury you!" Over the last year, you\'d probably be right. However, every single bubble ends the same, it\'s just the underlying assets and catalysts that vary. You feeling a little bearish? Are you fingers itching to YOLO some puts like last March? Don\'t short SPY, short ARKK.\n\nThis is not a case to short ARKK just because the stocks it holds are too high. Shorting a bubble just bc it\'s up is a bad time. This is a case to short ARKK because of how it functions as an ETF. For starters, an ETF is essentially a bundle of stocks. You buy ARKK and you indirectly invest in Tesla, Square, Paypal, Zillow, etc. However, the inner mechanisms at work are quite interesting. Every x amount of dollar inflows leads to ARKK buying more shares of its underlying stocks. Why sometimes so are buying ARKK shares from a willing seller, the money usually goes straight to Ark Invest, where it is routed to the underlying shares. People buy ARKK, ARKK has to buy shares of Tesla, Square, etc. to create new ETF units, the stock buys help the ETF price go up, more people want to buy ARKK because it\'s performing well, so more money flowing into underlying stocks, etc. You see what\'s happening? More inflows = more buys = better performance = more inflows, and so it repeats. However, stocks only have so many shares, and Ark has more than quintupled its holding sizes in the last year. Ark now owns more than 10% of the shares of several of its portfolio companies. It is difficult for Ark to offload this many shares in a short time if the company wants to rebalance, as it will move the stock price significantly. Ark has since "diversified" by buying speculative "growth stocks" such as 0 revenue reverse merger plays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what? Well a number of Ark\'s holdings have increased by 400% or more from last years HIGHS in February, yet the underlying companies are largely unchanged. Tesla\'s meteoric rise is a prime example. Many of these holdings are now struggling to break out to new highs, and appear to be either consolidating or breaking down. ARKK itself is up 400% from the march lows and 180% from last February, by far outpacing the indices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIronically, more and more people are talking about Ark now, though it is mathematically much harder for the company to outperform simply due to its bloated size. Combine this with Ark\'s tendency to largely ignore valuations and hold a number of incredibly pricy "growth" stocks, and the stage is set for an unwinding. The FAANG stocks are not massively overvalued, IMO. Apple and Amazon are fine and unlikely to crash. Tesla and other Ark holdings are a different story. Sector rotation is real, and Tesla appears to be falling victim. Other high flyers may soon follow. If and when investors start taking profits on their ARKK positions, the company will be forced to sell  off a portion of the underlying assets. This will cause increased selling pressure on the already sputtering growth names, thus pushing a stock decline. This decline will impact ARKK\'s price, leading more investors to sell off, thus accelerating a massive reduction in holdings which will continue to tank ARKK\'s price. Momentum works both up and down, and Ark\'s illiquid 10% holdings in a number of companies may be its grave as it will be forced to sell off its own positions if outflows begin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe it\'s because we are approaching the one year anniversary of March 2020, but my bear senses are tingling. The high flyers of last year are most vulnerable, and the mechanisms behind ETFs make ARKK a prime target.

Today‚Äôs opening was an example of hedges becoming afraid they lose control over their shorts, and we lost 5 dollars on SPY in 20 minutes, and the day they actually lose control will be a shorting onslaught for them.\n\nThis relates to tomorrow because they would love to buy back the calls they sold for as little as possible, and by buying back puts general losses on the market don‚Äôt hurt as much. Todays vertical rises/ falls made option volatility very high and the high volatility raised prices which need to be torn down by a huge gap down overnight into a slide tomorrow.

But we have an idea what tesla is targeting.  And we have teslas track record for the past 10 years or so.\n\n20M deliveries by 2030.  Power revenues equal to auto revenues.  Plus robo taxis.  Not to mention anything else like service, superchargers, insurance, possible air craft down the road, etc.\n\nSo you can use that, 30% margins on autos, avg selling prices of say $25k. To get auto revenues estimates.  Double that revenue for power.  Then multiple by a probability of success.\n\nRobo taxis are a real outlier that could possibly double both of those or be equal to zero.\n\nSo its really difficult to assign value. Which is why the stock is so volatile.\n\nThe high price is due to tesla historically high success at hitting 50% CARG since 2012.  Just try carrying forward 30% CARG for 10 years and see what estimates that gives you.\n\nAs such market is expecting tesla to do well.  Production is lined up for 1M autos this year to not be an unreasonable number, double of 2020.\n\nDo all the above and assign a price multiple to the revenue.\n\nSo teslas track is strong, its history is strong, and its potential is even stronger.\n\n\nSo do the math.  20M autos at 25k sale price yields 500B in revenue.  Double that to include power potential, so $1T in revenue.  30% margins leaves us with 300B in profits (assuming they can get earnings to near equal auto margins, they currently do NOT).  A 20 P/E gives us $6T market cap.  This ignores robo taxis.\n\nSo $6000 a share by 2030, assuming no robo taxi revenue, production hit targets, and 20 P/E.  Obviously a lot of risk to these targets though.\n\nAlternatively, 40% CARG (tesla has had 50% since they IPO'd) would put 2030 revenue at $896B.  Not far off from the above.\n\n\nBig questions are\n\n1) can it hit/maintain 30% margins as EVs race to the bottom on prices/commodize.  Apple has done well with phones but autos may be more difficult, idk\n\n2) can it turn revenue into profits equal to 30% profit margins.  Current earnings are no where near the declared auto profit margins. \n\n3) can it scale manufacturing fast enough to hit target with batteries being a big limitation, driven by limits in battery supply chains, which they have to take in house and reinvent to achieve \n\n4) is a 20 P/E reasonable.  If not what is?  Most autos are much less then this.  But most autos have terrible debt positions and near no growth.  \n\n5) biggest what if, can they make robo taxis a global thing?  How will that affect revenue and margins?\n\nMay be a good time to BUY THE DIP\n\n\nDisclaimer: not investment advice.  I am long shares and call since 2016.  I like the stock.

Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.\n\n&gt; * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won‚Äôt last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.\n\n&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday‚Äôs downdraft, closing slightly higher. It‚Äôs doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell‚Äôs testimony this week\n\n&gt; * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell‚Äôs remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it‚Äôs been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again\n\n&gt; * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world‚Äôs largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.\n\n&gt; * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk‚Äôs electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Home Depot, Macy‚Äôs report better than expected quarterly results\n\n&gt; * Home Depot‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot‚Äôs CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.\n\n&gt; * Shares of Macy‚Äôs rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company‚Äôs efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday‚Äôs trading, Macy‚Äôs shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public\n\n&gt; * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nh32H4C.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wWFBkUD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GqC0Wpr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/rKXZEUq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/X3QHyB3.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Xj9NIWe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ceMrg4D.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JwEoQ16.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/roUylhe.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttppoOf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LwYb3Ms.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/gs9zcaT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aBr8P6f.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-home-depot-palo-alto-networks-shopify-amc.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Home Depot (HD)** ‚Äì The home improvement retailer beat quarterly estimates by 3 cents with earnings of $2.65 per share.

"Don\'t short meme stocks!" "Cathy will bury you!" Over the last year, you\'d probably be right. However, every single bubble ends the same, it\'s just the underlying assets and catalysts that vary. You feeling a little bearish? Are you fingers itching to YOLO some puts like last March? Don\'t short SPY, short ARKK.\n\nThis is not a case to short ARKK just because the stocks it holds are too high. Shorting a bubble just bc it\'s up is a bad time. This is a case to short ARKK because of how it functions as an ETF. For starters, an ETF is essentially a bundle of stocks. You buy ARKK and you indirectly invest in Tesla, Square, Paypal, Zillow, etc. However, the inner mechanisms at work are quite interesting. Every x amount of dollar inflows leads to ARKK buying more shares of its underlying stocks. Why sometimes so are buying ARKK shares from a willing seller, the money usually goes straight to Ark Invest, where it is routed to the underlying shares. People buy ARKK, ARKK has to buy shares of Tesla, Square, etc. to create new ETF units, the stock buys help the ETF price go up, more people want to buy ARKK because it\'s performing well, so more money flowing into underlying stocks, etc. You see what\'s happening? More inflows = more buys = better performance = more inflows, and so it repeats. However, stocks only have so many shares, and Ark has more than quintupled its holding sizes in the last year. Ark now owns more than 10% of the shares of several of its portfolio companies. It is difficult for Ark to offload this many shares in a short time if the company wants to rebalance, as it will move the stock price significantly. Ark has since "diversified" by buying speculative "growth stocks" such as 0 revenue reverse merger plays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what? Well a number of Ark\'s holdings have increased by 400% or more from last years HIGHS in February, yet the underlying companies are largely unchanged. Tesla\'s meteoric rise is a prime example. Many of these holdings are now struggling to break out to new highs, and appear to be either consolidating or breaking down. ARKK itself is up 400% from the march lows and 180% from last February, by far outpacing the indices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIronically, more and more people are talking about Ark now, though it is mathematically much harder for the company to outperform simply due to its bloated size. Combine this with Ark\'s tendency to largely ignore valuations and hold a number of incredibly pricy "growth" stocks, and the stage is set for an unwinding. The FAANG stocks are not massively overvalued, IMO. Apple and Amazon are fine and unlikely to crash. Tesla and other Ark holdings are a different story. Sector rotation is real, and Tesla appears to be falling victim. Other high flyers may soon follow. If and when investors start taking profits on their ARKK positions, the company will be forced to sell  off a portion of the underlying assets. This will cause increased selling pressure on the already sputtering growth names, thus pushing a stock decline. This decline will impact ARKK\'s price, leading more investors to sell off, thus accelerating a massive reduction in holdings which will continue to tank ARKK\'s price. Momentum works both up and down, and Ark\'s illiquid 10% holdings in a number of companies may be its grave as it will be forced to sell off its own positions if outflows begin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe it\'s because we are approaching the one year anniversary of March 2020, but my bear senses are tingling. The high flyers of last year are most vulnerable, and the mechanisms behind ETFs make ARKK a prime target. This is a David and Goliath moment for our gay bears out there, good luck.'), ("(2/23) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News", "(2/23) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub!

Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.\n\n&gt; * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won‚Äôt last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.\n\n&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday‚Äôs downdraft, closing slightly higher. It‚Äôs doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell‚Äôs testimony this week\n\n&gt; * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell‚Äôs remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it‚Äôs been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again\n\n&gt; * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world‚Äôs largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.\n\n&gt; * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk‚Äôs electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Home Depot, Macy‚Äôs report better than expected quarterly results\n\n&gt; * Home Depot‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot‚Äôs CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.\n\n&gt; * Shares of Macy‚Äôs rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company‚Äôs efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday‚Äôs trading, Macy‚Äôs shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public\n\n&gt; * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nh32H4C.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wWFBkUD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GqC0Wpr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/rKXZEUq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/X3QHyB3.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Xj9NIWe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ceMrg4D.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JwEoQ16.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/roUylhe.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttppoOf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LwYb3Ms.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/gs9zcaT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aBr8P6f.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-home-depot-palo-alto-networks-shopify-amc.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Home Depot (HD)** ‚Äì The home improvement retailer beat quarterly estimates by 3 cents with earnings of $2.65 per share.

"Don\'t short meme stocks!" "Cathy will bury you!" Over the last year, you\'d probably be right. However, every single bubble ends the same, it\'s just the underlying assets and catalysts that vary. You feeling a little bearish? Are you fingers itching to YOLO some puts like last March? Don\'t short SPY, short ARKK.\n\nThis is not a case to short ARKK just because the stocks it holds are too high. Shorting a bubble just bc it\'s up is a bad time. This is a case to short ARKK because of how it functions as an ETF. For starters, an ETF is essentially a bundle of stocks. You buy ARKK and you indirectly invest in Tesla, Square, Paypal, Zillow, etc. However, the inner mechanisms at work are quite interesting. Every x amount of dollar inflows leads to ARKK buying more shares of its underlying stocks. Why sometimes so are buying ARKK shares from a willing seller, the money usually goes straight to Ark Invest, where it is routed to the underlying shares. People buy ARKK, ARKK has to buy shares of Tesla, Square, etc. to create new ETF units, the stock buys help the ETF price go up, more people want to buy ARKK because it\'s performing well, so more money flowing into underlying stocks, etc. You see what\'s happening? More inflows = more buys = better performance = more inflows, and so it repeats. However, stocks only have so many shares, and Ark has more than quintupled its holding sizes in the last year. Ark now owns more than 10% of the shares of several of its portfolio companies. It is difficult for Ark to offload this many shares in a short time if the company wants to rebalance, as it will move the stock price significantly. Ark has since "diversified" by buying speculative "growth stocks" such as 0 revenue reverse merger plays.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what? Well a number of Ark\'s holdings have increased by 400% or more from last years HIGHS in February, yet the underlying companies are largely unchanged. Tesla\'s meteoric rise is a prime example. Many of these holdings are now struggling to break out to new highs, and appear to be either consolidating or breaking down. ARKK itself is up 400% from the march lows and 180% from last February, by far outpacing the indices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIronically, more and more people are talking about Ark now, though it is mathematically much harder for the company to outperform simply due to its bloated size. Combine this with Ark\'s tendency to largely ignore valuations and hold a number of incredibly pricy "growth" stocks, and the stage is set for an unwinding. The FAANG stocks are not massively overvalued, IMO. Apple and Amazon are fine and unlikely to crash. Tesla and other Ark holdings are a different story. Sector rotation is real, and Tesla appears to be falling victim. Other high flyers may soon follow. If and when investors start taking profits on their ARKK positions, the company will be forced to sell  off a portion of the underlying assets. This will cause increased selling pressure on the already sputtering growth names, thus pushing a stock decline. This decline will impact ARKK\'s price, leading more investors to sell off, thus accelerating a massive reduction in holdings which will continue to tank ARKK\'s price. Momentum works both up and down, and Ark\'s illiquid 10% holdings in a number of companies may be its grave as it will be forced to sell off its own positions if outflows begin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe it\'s because we are approaching the one year anniversary of March 2020, but my bear senses are tingling. The high flyers of last year are most vulnerable, and the mechanisms behind ETFs make ARKK a prime target.

As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we\'ll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).\n\nWhat is truly unique about Palantir\'s software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir\'s software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company\'s clients\' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir\'s cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.\n\nNow, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov\'t). But I think what boomers don\'t understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.\n\nLet me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest\'s large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla\'s performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn\'t have access to trial data on say, congested roads.\n\nBack to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR\'s revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company\'s growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir\'s clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn\'t talk up Palantir\'s greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!\n\nThe reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir\'s platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.\n\nThis gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? \n\nLet\'s start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn\'t *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn\'t add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett\'s whole commitment to "value."\n\n[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested. It seems like a real knock-off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials, but so what? A bunch of washed-up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI? Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9/11 (PLTR also called the "gold standard" by these agencies according to *TechCrunch*), why waste your time in [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) or Snowflake? Don\'t even get make me started on Splunk, IBM (who conceded they suck by signing on w/ PLTR last week), or MSFT.\n\nAnd while we\'re at it, let\'s talk about valuations to drive the point home. According to the *Financial Times,* PLTR is valued at a $48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales. To start, yes that is very lofty, even after accounting for the recent sell-off due to earnings/lock-up fears. But I\'ll pick on my prime targets, SNOW and AI, if we can even call them competitors (we\'ll be nice). SNOW has just under an $80B market cap, but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales! AI is trading at a $15B market cap, and is trading at 70.5x 2020 estimated sales!! That\'s fucking crazy, and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value (or he just doesn\'t understand technology).\n\nSince the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years, let\'s talk about that. As I mentioned in my DD yesterday, PLTR reported EPS of $0.06/share on a non-GAAP basis, which is TRIPLE what the street predicted!! But thanks to a $100M stockholder compensation expense, the GAAP basis was a loss of $0.02/share, and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR. \n\nIf you understand how business development works, these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company. How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay? But as you grow into your valuations, like PLTR will, why do you need to do it? (PLTR has essentially promised 30% + growth for 5+ years, and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report). Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay? Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing.\n\nI also mentioned PLTR was a direct-listing yesterday, unlike any of these other names here. If you don\'t know what that means, basically PLTR didn\'t have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process. So equity research, investment banking, asset management, and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR (just Jeffries it seems for now).\n\nAnd this is what I mean. Again as I mentioned yesterday, it happens with all megacap tech companies. Think about it as evolution. Facebook. Apple. Tesla. Google. Microsoft. These guys weren\'t oversubscribed by the money makers either, nor were they cheaply valued either. But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings, these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers, which is exactly what will happen with Palantir (we are already seeing this- their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12% in January to 21% right now).\n\nThis is what I want you all to think about. As a disclosure, I am very long PLTR (you can view my positions on yesterday\'s DD), but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not, read about Palantir Technologies. This is the company of the future: able to tailor its cutting-edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects: climate change, further space exploration, geopolitical/nuclear tensions, renewable energy adoption, inequality, police reform, and so much more, while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve. Given the world is an ever expanding place, and the dominant players are already seated at the table, I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all.\n\n\\*\\***This is not financial advice. I recommend you read up on PLTR, pour through its financials, and hear more from its CEO, Alex Karp, and Chairman, Peter Thiel- then make your own informed, balanced, intelligent, rational decision. Without a doubt, this will be** ***the*** **company being discussed in the decades to come, and I just want to expedite the conversation now.**'), ('$TSLA Gang HODL till Valhalla', '$TSLA Gang HODL till Valhalla'), ('A üåàüêª perspective on $TSLA', 'A üåàüêª perspective on $TSLALong time lurker, first time poster, super üåàüêª on $TSLA. \n\nEDIT: I forgot you guys can\'t read - TL;DR: short term üöÄüöÄ, long term = big ‚¨áÔ∏è. A good way to look at it is - to increase in value Tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky. For the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once, or maybe not even at all. \n\nBefore I start let me make it clear that, while I do eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner I am by no means an expert and this is hardly a *serious* DD like some others I\'ve seen here before. This is just my opinion and my take, do what you will you beautiful retards\n\nAlso - I like Tesla, and I respect them a lot. I love that they made electric cars S3XY, and I want one, but God damn if they aren\'t insanely overvalued. I\'m betting against the stock, not the company. Let\'s just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand - Tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer (+Lyft) COMBINED. I love their cars, but dude holy FUCK. You absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond. So let\'s talk why this action today is expected, natural, and IMO, only sealing Tesla\'s fate towards reality.\n\nFirst - Tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago. Elon even admitted as much [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html). While they have done extremely well since then, and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand (especially Q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 BILLION USD from $3B), this worries me more than encourages me. Why aren\'t they spending this cash on future R&amp;D efforts, paying down debt, making even more factories (yes yes India I know, but MORE), charging stations, battery tech, or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks non-stop despite Coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit (barely) their delivery targets, etc? Tesla already has mega churn because Elon/\'the culture\' burns people out, and a bonus would be super well received I\'m sure. Nope, they buy some digital currency (you know the one). Look, say what you will, Elon is a bit of a weirdo. Love him, but man if he isn\'t unusual for a Billionaire visionary, and that move was definitely weird for a large(ish) corporation to do with so much money given they\'re so young, relatively unproven (compared to other auto makers, at least in the eyes of the boomer clan) and looking to aggressively ramp up production. To me, it shows they don\'t have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash, so they\'d rather drive traffic to sales via, well, a meme. That might be a genius move, but it\'s definitely non-standard and doesn\'t speak to confidence in new development coming easily. This means, at least to me, with Tesla, what you see is what you get. They don\'t have any huge surprises coming, or new products lurking that we haven\'t already heard about (robotaxi lol, $25k car, etc). They don\'t have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out, and they aren\'t aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead. Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, etc all have EVs on market this year, and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing EV demand. They\'re behind, but not for long. They may be slow giants, but they didn\'t get there for free, and they have been there that long for a reason. Finally, EV is the future for now, but what if in five years it\'s hydrogen, or fucking fusion, or maybe even some bad stuff happens with EV and everyone wants ICE again - Tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once - might make them slower, but it\'s also less risk, and they\'re not THAT slow seeing as they\'re already on the market. It is legitimately retarded to count those auto-makers out. At that point just roll your 401k into Robinhood.\n\nSecond - let\'s talk Tesla fundamentals (ish). I\'m not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because I am a moron and I don\'t know how. What I am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers. Here is what Tesla (currently) sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from: Cars (duh), Solar roof/Solar wall, Robotaxis eventually, Insurance eventually, Semis eventually. People like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be (maybe, maybe not, time will tell), and I\'ll talk about that in a second. \nCars, duh, Teslas are dope as hell. They have had their issues in the past, but they\'re sick and people want them. Demand is there for sure and growing rapidly, I won\'t deny. BUT, others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards EV. Meaning, when the old, crusty ass MFs who don\'t know "What\'s an electricity" decide they want an EV, they will have SIGNIFICANTLY more choice as consumers than you or I today if we were to go car shopping. This will, undoubtedly, pull away from Tesla sales. You can assume that Tesla somehow magically doesn\'t lose any interest in a field with increasing competition, but this just isn\'t reality. People like new things, and companies that make new good cars will see sales. Tesla is that right now, will they be that in the future? I\'m not certain. See production scaling concerns above. To really assume they won\'t lose any consumer interest despite growing competition, they\'d need to be pumping out multiple different models. I\'m talking a non "cyber" Tesla truck, some sort of hatchback/sport crossover, maybe even an \'adventure sport\' rig like an EV 4 Runner or the EV Hummer that\'s coming out. Americans like big cars, it\'s a fact. Just because it\'s an EV and saving the planet doesn\'t mean consumers want to sacrifice - this is why Tesla was and has been successful, because they finally made an EV that wasn\'t fugly as shit and a laughing stock, but if they don\'t continue to drive innovation into existing ICE sectors with EV tech, they\'re going to get left behind. Tesla is gonna want to capture this market share, and they haven\'t even hinted at it so far. I don\'t know specific numbers, and I don\'t think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt, but Tesla isn\'t going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future EV sphere unless they really buck up. If anything, by not doing these things now, they\'re backing themselves into a corner and a specific \'look\' that might be hard to shake later.\nNext: solar things. Solar wall and roof are dope, but they\'re not cheap, and pretty niche right now. It requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place. There\'s also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now. We *could* see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy, in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable, but it\'s still a matter of scale. I don\'t know their production numbers but with how little I\'ve heard about it, I don\'t think they\'re huge, and if demand spikes, they won\'t be in a great place to capture it if they aren\'t scaling appropriately (see cash concerns above). \nNow let\'s talk Robotaxis and Insurance. Insurance is a dud, that\'s not big money. Maybe I\'m not just a retard, but also an idiot, but I truly don\'t think Tesla offering insurance does ANYTHING positive for their bottom line. The way I understand the proposition is that because they\'re so confident in their self-driving tech they would become your insurance company, insuring you if FSD made any mistakes. This is a lot of liability forrrr nothing. They can\'t really take payments for it, unless it\'s well below what consumers pay now for insurance, otherwise are they really so confident about their tech? If that\'s the case, insurers will drop rates and lay off employees/close locations to meet those rates because a) they like money and b) it\'s even easier money than now if they\'re less likely to pay out. At a certain point, Tesla\'s "insurance" is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for Tesla. They take on a lot of risk, and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isn\'t too high (AND after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this), otherwise they\'re taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain. Robotaxis are equally dud-ish. Again, maybe I\'m just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people. Even though people bitch about other people, everyone bitched about being inside/away from society during Rona and never seeing anyone. Some people like those random interactions you get with a real person, and some people just truly don\'t trust robots. Both of these take away from potential customers/market share Tesla is likely to see from Robotaxis. Also old people and tech don\'t generally mix. Getting better, but still, old people and robots likely won\'t be a hot seller. Further, regulation and the required insurance/warranty/coverage whatever for this whole operation won\'t be quick or cheap. What happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out (asleep or faints) in your Robotaxi? What happens if it does happen to get in an accident, or if it gets a flat tire? What happens if the address is wrong, or someone needs to change where they\'re going? What if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesn\'t respond, or what if they aren\'t a native speaker or are disabled (mute, deaf, blind, need assistance getting into trunk or into/out of car)? How do these situations get handled? Finally - not everyone wants to have random people in their car, especially without supervision. What if someone trashes your car? Or pisses/shits/pukes in there while they\'re drunk? Sure Tesla or whoever might cover you, but Robotaxis won\'t clean themselves. Further - what about charging? The cars won\'t charge themselves after they\'re done with their \'shift\', so unless you\'re able to go out and plug it in, what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home? Guess you gotta wait. Not saying it\'s impossible, just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk. And here\'s the kicker - it\'s not even a super profitable industry. Uber is operating at a loss and they\'re the defacto millennial ride calling service. Lyft and Yellow Cab still exist, among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like Asia. Europe is much more walkable IMO so it\'s not *as* popular from what I\'ve seen, but in major cities (London) sure it still is. Overall Robotaxis aren\'t really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for Tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots. Plus, if everyone has a Tesla, who the fuck is riding in the Robotaxis? Even if you assume somehow Tesla starts being like USPS or Amazon and delivering packages/groceries/becomes a god damn short bus, there still will be competitors and it\'s still not as easy as saying \'but it\'s the fUtuRe\'.\nSemis - I don\'t know shit about shit here, but I haven\'t heard much more than a peep about this, so I\'m naively assuming it\'s not a huge corner of Tesla\'s business projections for the future. Maybe Tesla becomes the Daimler of EV and sells only big ass EV Semis, but I doubt it. I don\'t see this being a huge money maker, perhaps I\'m very wrong.\nLastly batteries - lots of people like to say how Tesla\'s batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors, blah blah, but I don\'t really buy this. Their tech may be really good now, but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming HARD for the money in the EV sphere. I don\'t want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech - but SOMEONE will. People like money, a lot. If these companies don\'t figure out how to build their own batteries like Tesla, someone will. And here is where Tesla\'s battery strategy becomes not super useful - Tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries - if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to Tesla\'s, they will likely end up a lot cheaper (eventually, not immediately) because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other EV makers, (standardizing in the process no less) not just the batteries Tesla needs. And if that never happens, it means the EV makers made their own, which means they are confident enough in their own cost/performance/etc, and Tesla really isn\'t that far ahead. I know Tesla has a big advantage here now, but that doesn\'t mean people who worked on Tesla batteries won\'t go work elsewhere for more money, and it doesn\'t mean these other companies won\'t hire young and hungry Masters and PhD grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to Yale. In fact, that tech is probably already being developed in Ivy League labs for fun by those exact types of people for their PhD and Professors using their grant and research money, hell some boy scout in a garage in Iowa might be doing it right now. Tesla may be a leader now, counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid. Everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $1500+ is either completely braindead, irretrievably stupid, or not paying any attention whatsoever. They\'re assuming Tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and they\'re the golden child forever. Look, I like Tesla, but no matter what endeavor they go after, someone else is gonna go for it too. Tesla may end up being better at it, but that doesn\'t make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesn\'t mean everyone will use Tesla\'s stuff. Some people don\'t like the brand, some people don\'t like Elon, others may just like other stuff more. \n\nFinally, look at the "anatomy of a bubble" and compare it to Tesla\'s stock chart. It\'s shockingly similar. I know, I know, that\'s moronic, but I\'m a moron and a üåàüêª so what can I say. The other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is Radio Corporation of America circa 1930. Radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the FUCKIN FUTURE dude. So shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie, turns out radio wasn\'t the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be, and stock prices tanked. This has happened with every bubble, ever. Everyone thinks they\'re invincible, everyone thinks this time is different, everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong, ever (Cathie Wood √§hem √§hem), but every. single. time. they\'ve been proven wrong. Fundamentals always matter, and Tesla ain\'t there chief. Finally - Graham, Dodd, Buffet, some of the most legendary investors/investing advice people EVER whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions, warn about \'buying at any price, assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in you\'ll make money\'. This sound familiar? How about those ludicrous price targets of $1600/share? Sound reasonable? Unless Tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole (and I don\'t just mean ICE to EV retards), their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked.\n\nThere\'s a few catalysts that I can think of as well - some bearish, some bullish. \nFor some bullish ones: UK announced Uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors, meaning their profits will be hurt. This does mean good news for Robotaxis, if and only if they can actually make them work profitably. Further, "loos-id" (don\'t think I can say this name here) is going public and Rivian is slated to go public this year as well. If these companies, or NKLA, or NIO or some other companies have significant and public blunders, Tesla stands to gain. \nHowever - some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they DONT fuck up, they\'re just more competition in an increasingly crowded space. More choices means less profits for Tesla. Also, in case you guys forgot, Tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights. They don\'t offer 401ks and they have been staunchly anti-union. Further, Elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders, and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home. He might not have been directly involved in this, but Tesla sure was. While those have already eclipsed, it isn\'t a promising outlook for the future, and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout. I\'m not saying they\'re gonna miss targets, but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strike/rebel and want more representation/compensation/work life balance. This would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins. Further, with a democratic party leading all branches, and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions, companies like Amazon and Tesla that don\'t treat workers well may see legal/punitive backlash from the government if they don\'t change things themselves. I for one would be *popcorn meme* watching AOC and Elon duke it out on twitter over something like this. Also, Tesla is opening a new factory in India and there are factories in China, but these might not be as great as people think. India is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there, along with China and the Uighurs. I would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues, which could spell bad news for Tesla. These countries are great new markets, but like the USA, they also have their own car manufacturers and other EV players - Tesla isn\'t going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out.\n\nSo all of this paints my pretty grim picture for Tesla\'s stock price, but here\'s where I do my retard math. If you look at Yahoo finance for Tesla\'s book value, you get like $20/share. This takes into account all of Tesla\'s assets and liabilities. Now Tesla could take on more liabilities/debt in order to fund more R&amp;D and drop their book value by doing so, but here\'s the thing - they have like $16B cash on deck to do that, and they haven\'t. I don\'t see them taking out massive loans that haven\'t been \'normal business procedure\' for them in the coming year(s). So, take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50% year over year for 5 years straight (which would be fucking insane). This gives you like $154/share Book value. Now, let\'s look at their peers and their sector. EV as a whole is in a bubble IMO so I don\'t think it\'s really legitimate to compare to their EV peers (EV is the tech bubble, Tesla is the specific \'stock issue\' in question affected most heavily because of name/brand recognition). So, compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or I have been alive (Toyota, VW, BMW, Honda, Daimler, Suzuki, Ford, GM) the average price to book ratio of those companies is 1.16. Tesla\'s is 35.25. If you take the insane growth figure I listed before (which represents 50% YoY TRUE growth in the company - averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value) AND you add on a 125% INCREASE of the P/B ratio (so 225% raw) compared to their peers (this assumes they\'re 125% more pricey than their closest competitors, after insane growth for the next five years, meaning we\'re assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for Tesla) and you price all of that in TODAY you get a value of $401/share. Tesla is almost double that today. \n\nIn my opinion, Tesla\'s true value lies around $100/share. With an assumption of 20% YoY growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50% increase of P/B relative to peer average (Tesla is the P/B sector leader with this factor added on), you get $75/share. If you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better, call it $100 or $150. This \'book value\' (and its growth expectation) wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of Tesla bulls like to point to saying how Tesla is supreme and much better than companies like Toyota which literally fucking created \'Lean Manufacturing\' (it\'s called "the Toyota way") that transformed not just auto manufacturing, but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general. Put up against that, Tesla may be a maverick, but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition. Anything more than $200/share and I think you\'re truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history. \n\nSo where does that leave us, today? Well, Michael Burry, despite being pretty crazy, is actually pretty brilliant, and has been skeptical/short on Tesla long before I decided to jack myself to the tits (quantity wise, not so much cost) on cheap premie puts. I don\'t think anyone can truly time a bubble, and the actions that the Fed has been taking, along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any \'top\' well beyond its natural range. I could get totally fucked because of this but whatever, I didn\'t throw in more than I can afford to lose so whatever happens, happens, plus as a üåàüêª I\'d probably deserve it anyways. The selloff that has happened over the past week I believe is the start of the \'blowoff\' phase. We\'re on the way down now, it\'s just a matter of how long it can hang on, IMO. The big dip yesterday was our \'local bottom\' until we ramp back up to the \'back to normal\' section. If you\'re long Tesla, personally, I\'d sell there. I do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two. I\'m not an expert but I\'m guessing in about a week or two we\'re back up near $800-820 and that\'ll be about the peak. After that, I think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level, wherever that ends up being (between $90 and $1600 if you listen to analysts, really insightful shit, really narrows it down). The bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to, and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals. I might be wrong about the timing, but I\'m as close to certain as I\'ve ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $200 levels in the next year. If I\'m right, I\'m buying a Tesla.\n\nPositions - lots of 3/19 puts at different sub $300 strikes.

Particularly at people crowing about Burry and inflation. Here\'s a quick explanation of why they are wrong, and why Powell is right, despite other central bankers worrying right now. \n\nInflation is one of the most misunderstood things in economics. Also, Burry is out to lunch on this one. Inflation is not a problem, and won\'t be for at least the rest of this year, likely longer. \n\nFor starters, asset prices and bond yields are only tangentially connected to inflation. Yields most directly, because they tend to reflect expectations - which, in the current environment, with yields rising from essentially zero, just means "not deflation" as opposed to "runaway inflation." Powell\'s comments yesterday were 100% correct on that account - the only reason other central banks are a little concerned is that a rebound in US yields will drive up EM borrowing costs, and a rebound in the global economy will drive up capital flows to non-US markets, leading to inflation \\*elsewhere\\* (we are a flight to safe haven, relatively speaking).\n\nEven further - US asset prices have relatively little to do with inflation these days, largely because of the relatively open international economy. Stock prices *right now*, in particular, are purely due to there being relatively few places to park money despite a broadly *deflationary* global economy over the past 12-18 months. The retail trading spike is part of it, too, as is international money being parked in the US to hedge against currency risk - again, because we are the reserve currency and a flight to safety. \n\nWhat we are witnessing is a slightly weird, but fairly predictable rebalancing. Major investors are moving out of US tech sectors that are overvalued and heavily weighted in both QQQ and SPY. They are moving into beaten-down industrials (e.g. Alcoa, Oil stocks, transports), consumer discretionary (e.g. restaurants, beverages, hotels, *actual* casinos), and emerging market stocks. \n\nTL;DR: It\'s fine to expect some inflationary pressures in non-US markets moving forward, but US markets are relatively insulated due to how the open economy functions given the US Dollar is the reserve currency. \n\nSource: I have extensive graduate training in economic policy. These are super basic trends.'), ('Am I a ü¶• or are covered calls way better than they should be?', "Am I a ü¶• or are covered calls way better than they should be?My first foray into options was TSLA buying calls and puts last summer.

This is basically finding someone else who wants the option to buy your stocks at a set price and will pay you a little bit for that privelege. \n\nThis is where I don't understand how it's not a great deal.\n\nLet's say AMC you have 200 shares.  Doable with a $1500 investment.   You can sell a call for $9 and $12 ending this Friday and make $32 &amp; $11.  So in one week you made $43.  That's almost a 3% gain in a week.

As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we\'ll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).\n\nWhat is truly unique about Palantir\'s software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir\'s software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company\'s clients\' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir\'s cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.\n\nNow, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov\'t). But I think what boomers don\'t understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.\n\nLet me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest\'s large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla\'s performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn\'t have access to trial data on say, congested roads.\n\nBack to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR\'s revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company\'s growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir\'s clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn\'t talk up Palantir\'s greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!\n\nThe reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir\'s platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.\n\nThis gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? \n\nLet\'s start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn\'t *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn\'t add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett\'s whole commitment to "value."\n\n[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested. It seems like a real knock-off version of Palantir based on what I can ascertain from their public materials, but so what? A bunch of washed-up junkies from Oracle think they can lead the transition to AI? Compared to a company that was seeded in 2003 specifically to work with the CIA and other intelligence agencies after 9/11 (PLTR also called the "gold standard" by these agencies according to *TechCrunch*), why waste your time in [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) or Snowflake? Don\'t even get make me started on Splunk, IBM (who conceded they suck by signing on w/ PLTR last week), or MSFT.\n\nAnd while we\'re at it, let\'s talk about valuations to drive the point home. According to the *Financial Times,* PLTR is valued at a $48B market cap and is trading at 34X 2021 estimated sales. To start, yes that is very lofty, even after accounting for the recent sell-off due to earnings/lock-up fears. But I\'ll pick on my prime targets, SNOW and AI, if we can even call them competitors (we\'ll be nice). SNOW has just under an $80B market cap, but is trading at 80x 2021 estimated sales! AI is trading at a $15B market cap, and is trading at 70.5x 2020 estimated sales!! That\'s fucking crazy, and Buffett should sell SNOW immediately if he cares about value (or he just doesn\'t understand technology).\n\nSince the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years, let\'s talk about that. As I mentioned in my DD yesterday, PLTR reported EPS of $0.06/share on a non-GAAP basis, which is TRIPLE what the street predicted!! But thanks to a $100M stockholder compensation expense, the GAAP basis was a loss of $0.02/share, and Wall ST took the opportunity to AMBUSH PLTR. \n\nIf you understand how business development works, these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company. How else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay? But as you grow into your valuations, like PLTR will, why do you need to do it? (PLTR has essentially promised 30% + growth for 5+ years, and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report). Who does Apple need to incentivize to stay? Wall St is simply trying to make something out of nothing.\n\nI also mentioned PLTR was a direct-listing yesterday, unlike any of these other names here. If you don\'t know what that means, basically PLTR didn\'t have its IPO underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process. So equity research, investment banking, asset management, and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up PLTR (just Jeffries it seems for now).\n\nAnd this is what I mean. Again as I mentioned yesterday, it happens with all megacap tech companies. Think about it as evolution. Facebook. Apple. Tesla. Google. Microsoft. These guys weren\'t oversubscribed by the money makers either, nor were they cheaply valued either. But by the time the robust top line translated into earnings, these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers, which is exactly what will happen with Palantir (we are already seeing this- their institutional ownership nearly doubled from 12% in January to 21% right now).\n\nThis is what I want you all to think about. As a disclosure, I am very long PLTR (you can view my positions on yesterday\'s DD), but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not, read about Palantir Technologies. This is the company of the future: able to tailor its cutting-edge technology to all the intricate challenges the 21st century projects: climate change, further space exploration, geopolitical/nuclear tensions, renewable energy adoption, inequality, police reform, and so much more, while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve. Given the world is an ever expanding place, and the dominant players are already seated at the table, I could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all.\n\n\\*\\***This is not financial advice.

As I mentioned in my DD last night, I am just a 19-year-old college student, not an investment banker or hotshot market maker, but I believe the information I have ascertained about Palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet (but we\'ll keep it strictly to the software industry in this DD).\n\nWhat is truly unique about Palantir\'s software (Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) is how collaborative, scalable, and advanced it is. Let me break this down: Palantir\'s software is COLLABORATIVE b/c it meshes the company\'s clients\' data into a mega cloud. For example, the LAPD, BP, JP Morgan, and top law firms all upload their data onto Palantir\'s cloud, where they can get insights into efficiency, efficacy, and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture (these guys are all PLTR clients btw), and particularly useful for say, defending an embassy or managing a supply chain.\n\nNow, just to get it straight, there is no data/cloud that can come ANYWHERE close to the insights and knowledge on what Palantir has.  You might often hear from Wall Street research analysts/CNBC shills who complain that PLTR has too many rich clients (big companies/gov\'t). But I think what boomers don\'t understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the ADVANTAGE, not a weakness.\n\nLet me use an example from our beloved Cathie Wood and her firm Ark Invest\'s large position in Tesla extremely quickly (I promise). When asked about how she felt about Tesla\'s performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like Waymo (owned by Google), she commented last year that **having a vast collection of data** would separate those who succeed from those who attempt. As a reference, Tesla cars all transmit self-driving data back to the firm, which comes about through the many Tesla owners who drive all over the world. On the other hand, Waymo is committed to private testing stages only, which is shallow-minded b/c it doesn\'t have access to trial data on say, congested roads.\n\nBack to PLTR. The reason I bring up the Waymo-Tesla-Ark example is to highlight just how many clients PLTR\'s revenue base represents, and how impactful that is on a company\'s growth, scalability, and ultimately, the *success of their product*. But I mean when you think about it, Palantir\'s clientele is the **ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY/SOCIETY**. Go to the *Financial Times*, and try to find me an article that doesn\'t talk up Palantir\'s greatness in the U.K and their work helping NIH. EU members like Greece/France also use it for COVID vaccine tracking. Palantir has contracts with the Japanese/South Korean governments. Palantir has notably helped the U.S. catch infamous cucks like Osama Bin Laden to Bernie Madoff. Quite the diversity!\n\nThe reason for that entire BJ to Palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is. Not only is all this data accessible RIGHT NOW to all these clients to collaborate on Palantir\'s platform, but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutions/enterprises in the world. No matter how the political winds blow or how the global/domestic economy winds up, you can count on 3M, the DoD, Ferrari- to name a few- to continue seeking ways to scale, grow, expand, and Palantir certainly is the way.\n\nThis gets back to another central, bulletproof thesis surrounding Palantir. Who are its competitors? Who can do what Palantir does? \n\nLet\'s start with Snowflake. All credit to their talented team, Warren Buffett, and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their IPO and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily. But for lack of a better word, their software just isn\'t *dope* enough. I mean the UI contrast speaks for itself, but the intelligence is what matters here. Yes, data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business, but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesn\'t add any value? All Snowflake really is is Salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles. Really makes me question Buffett\'s whole commitment to "value."\n\n[C3.AI](https://C3.AI) at least has me interested.

So intuitively, the plays which would make most sense(withstand all of these) are undervalued stocks(rare gems) in an overvalued market!\n\nI introduce to you **(Ticker: $F) FORD üá∫üá∏ ü¶Ö.** The all American car manufacturer which withstood every recession since 1920\'s... The company which our government treats as a favorite child! The car manufacturer which produced most American cars ever, and finally the innovator which employs one of the greatest PR firms and R&amp;D teams. **I know, I know, you may say WTF??!! FORD??

(Veni, vidi, vici)\n\nYes, you read the tittle right!! Not only that, but also they are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EV cars to compete with TESLA). After years of development, this year they came out with **Mach-E.** An EV car which has a starting price of $35,395(After Federal Tax Credit which still applies to Ford EV\'s (indicates great government connections)) and easily rivals a model Y when it comes to value. It\'s way cheaper and has relatively comparable features.\n\nAs The Verge\'s Sean O‚ÄôKane perfectly said: "I don\'t think people should underestimate just how important the Mustang Mach-E could be. The Mustang branding makes it instantly familiar and the design is striking enough that it gets noticed right away without being so out there that it\'s uncomfortable or weird or alien. **It\'s the kind of car that in a couple of years, if enough of them are on the road, it can really make people take notice and think about buying an electric car in a way that the I-Pace or the Audi e-tron or the Chevy bolt never have or will. I think Ford is tapping into something only Tesla** really does well right now with the Mach-E, which is trying to mix that modern design with increasing ubiquity in a way that could make people feel like they\'re missing out on something, much like the **effect a new iPhone can have."**\n\nFor more on Mach E comparison to Tesla cars: [Link 1](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/23322283-rd-barris/5534036-reviews-of-ford-mustang-mach-e-show-tesla-no-secret-sauce) Link 2\n\n# What about production, constant need for innovative technology in EV\'s, and the need for other models?\n\n**Production(keep all of the following in mind because a Tesla comparison is ahead):**\n\nFord produces around 5.5-6 million cars per year, it\'s the second biggest US car manufacturer. They know the in\'s and out\'s of the car production market and have top tier international connections^(1). Additionally and more importantly, they have the government in their pocket.\n\nFord has **active** production facilities in Turkey, China, Romania, Spain, India, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Thailand, Russia, Taiwan, Argentina, England, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, and Slovakia^(1)(arranged by size). But, I\'m not here here today to talk about that. I\'ll be focusing on the EV car production.\n\nFord has already produced 10,000 Mach-E\'s and they delivered 5,000 of them to dealers. In addition, They are planning to produce 50,000 Mach-E\'s this year. While this number may seem minuscule in comparison to the six figure production number of their gas vehicles, it\'s an impressive start in the EV market. By comparison, this year so far Tesla has rolled out and sold just 14,100 of its electric SUVs, the Model X. And back in 2017, the EV manufacturer was able to produce only 1,764 of its popular Model 3s in the first six months of production. The following year, however, Tesla delivered more than 140,000 Model 3s.  While Tesla had a slow start, it certainly has caught up in filling  customer orders. In 2019, it‚Äôs averaged sales of 12,500 Model 3s a month or about 150,000 cars a year. While Ford won‚Äôt be able to match this years Tesla Sale numbers **initially**, it looks as if it‚Äôs off to a strong start. (Source: Motor Biscuits).\n\nAnother point to keep in mind, Other carmakers haven‚Äôt had as an impressive showing as Tesla in EV production, either. Jaguar sells a\xa0mere 200 I-Paces a month. The Audi E-Tron, a plug-in SUV, is averaging about 600 sales a month. As for the Chevrolet Bolt, its sales numbered about 13,100 to date this year. The Chevy EV‚Äôs first year saw only 23,000 produced(Motor Biscuits). and please don\'t get me started on Chinese EV BS... Bottom line is, aside from Tesla production numbers in the EV space, Ford is the next runner-up after Tesla.\n\n**What about international production and sales?**\n\nFord to go all electric in Europe by 2030! It intends to spend $1 billion to revamp a factory in Cologne, Germany, where it will produce EVs using a Volkswagen platform(Biggest car manufacturer in Europe).  This new strategy involves phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles in favor of electric power. The automaker expects to have **all commercial vehicles made by Ford in Europe be electric by 2024.** Two years later, it expects **to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plug-in hybrids.** Gasoline-powered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in Europe after 2030, Ford says. However, the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for two-thirds of its European sales.(source: Tech Crunch)\n\n**What about Asia?**\n\nFord announced Jan. 27 that its Mustang Mach-E SUV **will be manufactured by Changan Ford for customers in China.** The Mustang Mach-E will start being produced there later this year as it looks to tap into China\'s electric vehicle (EV) market. Remember that China is the world\'s biggest car market with more than 20m vehicles sold each year. (BBC)\n\n**What about government support in production?**\n\nFord CEO calls on U.S. government to support EV batteries, charging(Headline on Feb. 24 Reuters). He outlined the automaker‚Äôs plan to develop electric platforms for its top-selling trucks, vans and SUVs. What happened after that? Biden ordered for a review of US supply chains for vital goods such as large capacity batteries and semiconductors! In addition, he signed an executive order to amend the Semiconductor shortage. It seeks 37$ billion in funding legislation as a shortfall of semiconductors has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production.(Reuters)\n\n**Innovation and Technology:**\n\nFord and Google to Accelerate Auto Innovation, Reinvent Connected Vehicle Experience (Feb. 1) [(Ford link)](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html). Ford and Google came together in **first-of-its-kind partnership** to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to **accelerate Ford‚Äôs transformation plan.** They are working on data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) innovations. As part of this new, **six-year partnership,** millions of future Ford and Lincoln vehicles **at all price points will be  powered by Android, with Google apps and services built-in.** In addition, Ford and Google have established a collaborative group called, Team Upshift, that will push the boundaries of Ford‚Äôs transformation, unlock personalized consumer experiences, and drive disruptive, data-driven opportunities.\n\n**What other EV models are they working on?**\n\nin 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series  generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, which added up to $40 billion, Just something to think about. The F-series is their most successful car and they are planning to release the new EV version of it soon this year. After that, They will move to electrify almost every model one by one.\n\n# Valuation and Price target (~110$ = 429,000,00$M market cap)\n\nYes, I\'m crazy, but hear me out. It\'s obvious what argument I\'m going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it\'s not only about that and I\'ll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- some are outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it\'ll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don\'t lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn\'t work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it\'s still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It\'s mind boggling.\n\nIf WSB adopts $F, it can raise it be the next (110$+)  EV play in the industry. At that valuation(110$), it won\'t even be 50% of Tesla\'s 52-week high valuation. It\'s a highly speculative valuation, but I don\'t see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don\'t even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **üá∫üá∏ ü¶Ö**.\n\nFord has always put the American people over money and has provided so many American jobs for the last century. Ford is a well known American brand and it\'s deeply ingrained in the American history and culture. I\'m proud that my grandfather used to work in Ford(ME) and had great memories in there. In my opinion, the strength of this brand will continue on and it will rise from the ashes like an American bald Eagle**ü¶Ö** after a forest fire.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n1- All American, highly undervalued stock.  **‚úÖ** **üá∫üá∏**\n\n2- They are ready to dominate the EV market. Targeting mid class with high quality cheap EV\'s. **‚úÖ**\n\n3- Have the government support. **‚úÖ**\n\n4- Have a strong international factory presence for production. **‚úÖ**\n\n5- Strong PR, Research and development teams with a 6-year google partnership. **‚úÖ**\n\n**MY Price Target: 110$ TICKER:$F**\n\nPosition: 500 calls 17$ expires at 21 JAN 2022 (TICKER:$F)'), ('Apple: Who else is trying to time the recovery?', "Apple: Who else is trying to time the recovery?tl;dr predict when Apple shoots back up and you could hit a fat multiplier \n\nApple has been falling for a month with barely any green days to speak of.

Right there should be your biggest clue that those risks are priced in but I can give you more reasons.\n\nBut first, let me be clear on one point : This is a long term risk, not a short term one. The market will not crash tomorrow nor in the coming months but it can decrease the growth of the stock market. Or in the most extreme case cause a bear market or a crash.\n\nBut it seems like there are some confusion on reddit on what inflation we\'re talking about. So read this 10 times :\n\n*The Inflation risks are not on consumer prices but on the stock market.*\n\nRead it again! Again I said! And keep reading it because I\'m sick of reading posts about that. Those risks of increase in consumer spendings are WAY overblown and frankly non-existant.\n\nThis is because the average consumer didn\'t receive much money from the government in the last year. And the little money he did receive, he used it to either buy stuff that he would have bought anyway or buy stuff for leisure purposes. "*But have you seen Amazon\'s revenue?*" you might say. "*Yes, I\'ve seen it*" I would reply. Part of this revenue growth was due to AWS (their cloud business) and people being online more than ever during the pandemic, so server costs ballooned! \n\nBut I grant you that : there was a big increase in consumption (on e-commerce especially) BUT it was mostly due to people being stuck in their home : they didn\'t travel, didn\'t party or anything like that, so they used that excess money to buy stuff online. Also, they were pretty bored at home and buying stuff was a few clicks away so of course they\'d buy useless stuffs. There were other stuffs that impacted consumer spendings like people moving outside of big cities and making their home more confortable to live in (because you know, they\'re stuck at home).\n\nSo, when countries reopen, this trend will probably slow down (although it\'s setting a shift in consumer spending from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce but that\'s another story).\n\nAnd with the [US exports increasing during the pandemic](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/exports), the dollar increases enough in value to offset potential inflation risks.\n\nSo yeah, this inflation was never really a concern, but now let\'s talk about the stock market inflation concerns that most institutions were worried about.\n\nThe concern is as follow :\n\n&gt; FED buys bonds and gives money to companies, banks and hedge funds. Hedge funds and banks put this money in the stock market. Stock market goes up artificially thanks to all that money. Companies use this to compensate for missed revenue. Their financials don\'t look so bad because of all the money given to them. But, nothing is organic, everything is given by the FED and this might create a giant bubble that\'s ready to burst.\n\nOk, so a few things about that :\n\n- The stock market being stretched is nothing new, it\'s been a bubble "ready to burst" for a decade or so.\n- The tech sector did very well without the need of quantitative easing.\n- The actual thing you should worry about is not a market crash or a bear market but rather a *reduced growth*. That\'s why value stocks went up or flattened these past two weeks when growth stocks plunged. Most companies will increase in value but since a much bigger growth was priced in for growth stocks, their stock prices went down. By the way, that\'s why Tesla\'s stock price went down, that had nothing to do with its 1.5bn bet. \n- And for the concerns regarding all this money given to companies, there\'s not that much to worry about. When the economy recovers (in my opinion slowly from end-2021 to mid-2022), companies will generate revenue organically and as the economy gets better, MoneyPrinterMan will *progressively* reduce his bond buying program and *slowly* go on phase 2 of his plan : actually combating the inflation if it becomes a concern by then. \n\nThere might be a correction at some point but hedge funds still have a shit ton of money to invest. And they\'re not going to keep it in cash when we have a massive bull market like that.\n\nAnd I\'ll finish this rant by quoting our great savior Mr. MoneyPrinterMan Powell :\n\n&gt; Fuck your puts.\n\nAlso, there\'s [an article that explains this very well](https://www.im.natixis.com/en-ch/markets/post-pandemic-inflation-risk-2021).\n\nOk now let\'s talk about Powell speech for a minute.\n\n**Powell talked. Investors were not impressed**\n\nSummary of the speech tuesday : Hey bulls, nothing new, keep buying!\n\nSeriously, that\'s it!\n\nHe said he will keep buying bonds at the current pace because the economy has still not recovered as much as he would like. \n\nHe said that the inflation concerns are overblown.\n\nThen senators asked about racial inequalities and Powell basically said "wtf I\'m just the chairman of the FED not the fucking president." (I\'m paraphrasing a little) Although he aknowledged the problem, he didn\'t give any solution because well as he said it very well, he\'s "not the fucking president" (again paraphrasing a little ;)).\n\nThe Senator Kennedy asked "*Do you think we ought to go Catwoman on the budget and actually look for savings there?*" (yes he actually said that, I\'m NOT paraphrasing here). Powell said he didn\'t know the reference (and frankly I don\'t fully understand what that meant either).\n\n[Link of the video and transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/ux2lCF7KhCxCaP893gBjj6a3vD6H8wjZ47XZ56eLOD_bCvbSROyURMo4XtKOMy8-K2LB3wZ87l89r0ELEMVOJYvebgU)\n\nHe also talked about unemployment rates and that... Ah! That was pretty interesting. But today\'s recap is already long enough. Tomorrow, you\'ll get my "quick" thoughts on that (spoiler alert : it\'s not quick).\n\n**C3.ai is a must buy more than ever!**\n\nThis is a short one because I\'ve talked about this company in a previous daily recap. So I encourage you to read it first.\n\nBut now, I think this is the best time to buy the stock as it went down a lot recently (it\'s a growth stock and all growth stocks went down the past week or so). \n\nBut there\'s something that you might know : Chinese competition in the Big Data Analytics space was and is still going strong. The Chinese government is tracking everyone down which generates a lot of data, the chinese government gives chinese companies carte blanche on all fronts even if they become monopolies. And they do.\n\n[Here\'s a paper written in 2015 on how big the industry is in China](https://www.afcdud.com/fr/transport-afcdud/387-bigdatachina.html). \n\nBut something might change that. I really don\'t want to talk politics here so let\'s make it brief : Trump went hard on China and planned on continuing that way and people thought Biden would not go as hard. But turns out, [he follows pretty much the same strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/economy/biden-china.html). There\'s more detail to it, I encourage you to read the article and be informed on the situation.\n\nSo, this *might* be the moment where chinese companies get a big hit. They will probably get the same treatment as american companies and their big advantage will disappear.\n\nAnyway, so my point is this : My DD on C3.AI still stands and the potential regulation on China gives you another reason to buy (long term).\n\n**Here\'s a list of luxury brand companies**\n\n2 days ago, I wrote that companies selling luxury goods *that hold their value* are hot right now. Here\'s a curated list of companies that I think will benefit the most from people buying luxury goods :\n\n- Watches of Switzerland Group (it had a good run but it still has a lot of potential and it\'s a better bet than the others imo)\n- Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA\n- LVMH\n- Ralph Lauren Corp\n\nAlso, [a good article that talks about that](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-23/-unstoppable-luxury-stocks-remind-some-investors-of-u-s-tech).\n\n# Quick Update on my portfolio\n\nLast week I was cash gang up until yesterday where I bought spy calls expiring in June. I fucked up my timing, I bought them 2 hours before market open because I didn\'t know Powell was talking yesterday. Averaged down by buying calls at open as well. I think now the inflation concerns are priced in. The worse case scenario is NOT though but there\'s a very small probability that inflation will actually create an economic meltdown.\n\nI expect to keep my calls for at least a month or two. But I will revise my plan if the situation changes (and I will update you anyways).\n\n--------------------------------\n*I hope you liked this one.

There was always hype around a record label or some famous producer  opening their new studio, which would fail soon thereafter. They\'d have  amazing platinum plaques and credentials, but when they start their own  place, they fail HORRIBLY. They often had more musical talent than  management/business talent and would faceplant. Also, when normal people  would see the success of one studio, they want to start their own and  reproduce it; who wouldn\'t want to make their living recording cool  music all day?\n\nI was talking to  someone who used to work at a place like sweetwater, one of those venues  that sells equipment to all of the wannabes. Something stuck with me  that I\'ll never forget.  They told me, "you don\'t make money off the  dream of opening a studio. You make money \\*selling the dream of opening a  studio."\\* Sell the equipment. The fiberglass for panels. The preamps.  The console. The high end, tube U47 microphones. The setup of the  facility, all that jazz. Regardless of whether the studio does amazingly  well or fails entirely, you made your money. During a time of so many  people\'s home studio businesses recording people for cheap on craigslist  failing, so many professional studios failing, retailers of the  products necessary to set up said facility were doing amazing. Selling  the dream, generates more stable income than chasing the dream.\n\nLet\'s  transfer that analogy to new infrastructure plans, green energy  startups, solar/EV companies, wind energy companies, etc. There\'s going  to be an infrastructure plan regarding green energy coming out, unless  Biden was fibbing about a 2T plan to tackle climate change, which is  hard to believe with a Democratic house &amp; senate. To try and guess  which companies that will benefit, when they will start making profit,  whether they will go tits up or do well, and whether they are currently  in a bubble, that\'s too much for my small brain. To try and \\*time\\* it -  is even harder. Is ICLN going back down to $18 because it\'s a bubble  before it goes to $30 when Biden begins his 2T plan, or is it going to  $100 before he announces it? What car company will do best? Is TSLA  overvalued at its humble 1500 PE and about to get spanked by some  surprise Ford or GM comes out with, or is TSLA going to make 10000 PE  the new norm by this time next year? Timing this and picking a company,  as well as when bubbles will burst, is impossible. I don\'t have the  brain for it.\n\nOne thing is for  sure - every single one of them, will need copper. Copper is an  excellent conductor. Low resistance, low oxidation, cheap. It doesn\'t  \\*matter\\* whether the  company makes billions, or goes tits up. It  doesn\'t \\*matter\\* if a specific solar panel company makes great panels  and sells record numbers, or shit panels that all get recalled. In order  for them to even get started living the dream, someone needs to sell  them the commodities necessary to get started. Before they create, much  less sell, a single marketable product, they have to buy the copper.\n\nWe  combine this with another tailwind, the US dollar going to shit. The  dollar appears to be getting obilterated. Stimulus is going everywhere,  federal reserve balance sheet is exploding with seemingly no end in  sight. Inflation occurs as a result of two things - adding more to the  money supply, and a drop in production of goods/services. If huge swaths  of entire industries/jobs are considered "not essential" by politicians  for extended periods of time, you have a loss in production. If people  get sick and cannot produce as a result, you have a loss of production.  and if you have seemingly endless QE, money printer go brrr means more  money everywhere - to buy up a limited number of goods and services. The  result, is inflation.\n\nI am seeing  copper as a green energy + inflation play that is less risky than  speculating on any one particular company or fund. As someone who  believes inflation will get worse, and that green energy is the future, I  think copper is a bullish play. I am not quite sure the best way to  take advantage of this, if this is the case. I\'m more sharing this to  get criticism &amp; ideas from others than to actually give advice. I  own shares of a few copper ETFs right now and some ICLN, at the time of  this posting, and am not trying to give advice, but rather find holes in  my thesis so I can make better investment decisions.\n\n**TL;DR;  My theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper  to soar more than it has, and continue soaring. Is this a good  investment thesis, and if so, how can I best capitalize on it?**\n\nReasons:\n\n**1) Government subsidies/spending directed towards solar/wind/EV/clean energy companies causing a boom in demand of copper.**\n\n**2) Endless moneyprinting + shortage of copper from the pandemic/lockdowns pushing up the price of copper.**\n\n**3) New infrastructure plans backed by the federal government &amp; pushing up the demand &amp; price for copper.**'), ('Real life TSLA Gainz', 'Real life TSLA Gainz'), ("r/wallstreetbets is continuously scanned by Thinknum to scoop out mentions of $GME and other stocks.

Right there should be your biggest clue that those risks are priced in but I can give you more reasons.\n\nBut first, let me be clear on one point : This is a long term risk, not a short term one. The market will not crash tomorrow nor in the coming months but it can decrease the growth of the stock market. Or in the most extreme case cause a bear market or a crash.\n\nBut it seems like there are some confusion on reddit on what inflation we\'re talking about. So read this 10 times :\n\n*The Inflation risks are not on consumer prices but on the stock market.*\n\nRead it again! Again I said! And keep reading it because I\'m sick of reading posts about that. Those risks of increase in consumer spendings are WAY overblown and frankly non-existant.\n\nThis is because the average consumer didn\'t receive much money from the government in the last year. And the little money he did receive, he used it to either buy stuff that he would have bought anyway or buy stuff for leisure purposes. "*But have you seen Amazon\'s revenue?*" you might say. "*Yes, I\'ve seen it*" I would reply. Part of this revenue growth was due to AWS (their cloud business) and people being online more than ever during the pandemic, so server costs ballooned! \n\nBut I grant you that : there was a big increase in consumption (on e-commerce especially) BUT it was mostly due to people being stuck in their home : they didn\'t travel, didn\'t party or anything like that, so they used that excess money to buy stuff online. Also, they were pretty bored at home and buying stuff was a few clicks away so of course they\'d buy useless stuffs. There were other stuffs that impacted consumer spendings like people moving outside of big cities and making their home more confortable to live in (because you know, they\'re stuck at home).\n\nSo, when countries reopen, this trend will probably slow down (although it\'s setting a shift in consumer spending from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce but that\'s another story).\n\nAnd with the [US exports increasing during the pandemic](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/exports), the dollar increases enough in value to offset potential inflation risks.\n\nSo yeah, this inflation was never really a concern, but now let\'s talk about the stock market inflation concerns that most institutions were worried about.\n\nThe concern is as follow :\n\n&gt; FED buys bonds and gives money to companies, banks and hedge funds. Hedge funds and banks put this money in the stock market. Stock market goes up artificially thanks to all that money. Companies use this to compensate for missed revenue. Their financials don\'t look so bad because of all the money given to them. But, nothing is organic, everything is given by the FED and this might create a giant bubble that\'s ready to burst.\n\nOk, so a few things about that :\n\n- The stock market being stretched is nothing new, it\'s been a bubble "ready to burst" for a decade or so.\n- The tech sector did very well without the need of quantitative easing.\n- The actual thing you should worry about is not a market crash or a bear market but rather a *reduced growth*. That\'s why value stocks went up or flattened these past two weeks when growth stocks plunged. Most companies will increase in value but since a much bigger growth was priced in for growth stocks, their stock prices went down. By the way, that\'s why Tesla\'s stock price went down, that had nothing to do with its 1.5bn bet. \n- And for the concerns regarding all this money given to companies, there\'s not that much to worry about. When the economy recovers (in my opinion slowly from end-2021 to mid-2022), companies will generate revenue organically and as the economy gets better, MoneyPrinterMan will *progressively* reduce his bond buying program and *slowly* go on phase 2 of his plan : actually combating the inflation if it becomes a concern by then. \n\nThere might be a correction at some point but hedge funds still have a shit ton of money to invest. And they\'re not going to keep it in cash when we have a massive bull market like that.\n\nAnd I\'ll finish this rant by quoting our great savior Mr. MoneyPrinterMan Powell :\n\n&gt; Fuck your puts.\n\nAlso, there\'s [an article that explains this very well](https://www.im.natixis.com/en-ch/markets/post-pandemic-inflation-risk-2021).\n\nOk now let\'s talk about Powell speech for a minute.\n\n**Powell talked. Investors were not impressed**\n\nSummary of the speech tuesday : Hey bulls, nothing new, keep buying!\n\nSeriously, that\'s it!\n\nHe said he will keep buying bonds at the current pace because the economy has still not recovered as much as he would like. \n\nHe said that the inflation concerns are overblown.\n\nThen senators asked about racial inequalities and Powell basically said "wtf I\'m just the chairman of the FED not the fucking president." (I\'m paraphrasing a little) Although he aknowledged the problem, he didn\'t give any solution because well as he said it very well, he\'s "not the fucking president" (again paraphrasing a little ;)).\n\nThe Senator Kennedy asked "*Do you think we ought to go Catwoman on the budget and actually look for savings there?*" (yes he actually said that, I\'m NOT paraphrasing here). Powell said he didn\'t know the reference (and frankly I don\'t fully understand what that meant either).\n\n[Link of the video and transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/ux2lCF7KhCxCaP893gBjj6a3vD6H8wjZ47XZ56eLOD_bCvbSROyURMo4XtKOMy8-K2LB3wZ87l89r0ELEMVOJYvebgU)\n\nHe also talked about unemployment rates and that... Ah! That was pretty interesting. But today\'s recap is already long enough. Tomorrow, you\'ll get my "quick" thoughts on that (spoiler alert : it\'s not quick).\n\n**C3.ai is a must buy more than ever!**\n\nThis is a short one because I\'ve talked about this company in a previous daily recap. So I encourage you to read it first.\n\nBut now, I think this is the best time to buy the stock as it went down a lot recently (it\'s a growth stock and all growth stocks went down the past week or so). \n\nBut there\'s something that you might know : Chinese competition in the Big Data Analytics space was and is still going strong. The Chinese government is tracking everyone down which generates a lot of data, the chinese government gives chinese companies carte blanche on all fronts even if they become monopolies. And they do.\n\n[Here\'s a paper written in 2015 on how big the industry is in China](https://www.afcdud.com/fr/transport-afcdud/387-bigdatachina.html). \n\nBut something might change that. I really don\'t want to talk politics here so let\'s make it brief : Trump went hard on China and planned on continuing that way and people thought Biden would not go as hard. But turns out, [he follows pretty much the same strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/economy/biden-china.html). There\'s more detail to it, I encourage you to read the article and be informed on the situation.\n\nSo, this *might* be the moment where chinese companies get a big hit. They will probably get the same treatment as american companies and their big advantage will disappear.\n\nAnyway, so my point is this : My DD on C3.AI still stands and the potential regulation on China gives you another reason to buy (long term).\n\n**Here\'s a list of luxury brand companies**\n\n2 days ago, I wrote that companies selling luxury goods *that hold their value* are hot right now. Here\'s a curated list of companies that I think will benefit the most from people buying luxury goods :\n\n- Watches of Switzerland Group (it had a good run but it still has a lot of potential and it\'s a better bet than the others imo)\n- Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA\n- LVMH\n- Ralph Lauren Corp\n\nAlso, [a good article that talks about that](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-23/-unstoppable-luxury-stocks-remind-some-investors-of-u-s-tech).\n\n# Quick Update on my portfolio\n\nLast week I was cash gang up until yesterday where I bought spy calls expiring in June. I fucked up my timing, I bought them 2 hours before market open because I didn\'t know Powell was talking yesterday. Averaged down by buying calls at open as well. I think now the inflation concerns are priced in. The worse case scenario is NOT though but there\'s a very small probability that inflation will actually create an economic meltdown.\n\nI expect to keep my calls for at least a month or two. But I will revise my plan if the situation changes (and I will update you anyways).\n\n--------------------------------\n*I hope you liked this one.

I want to get better at this.*'), ('Thoughts on copper as an inflation, infrastructure, green energy play?', 'Thoughts on copper as an inflation, infrastructure, green energy play?I am bullish on copper, and I\'d like a critique of my thesis.\n\nWhen  I used to work in the recording studio business back in 2007, 8, 9, it  was well known that most people trying to start studios fail MISERABLY.  There was always hype around a record label or some famous producer  opening their new studio, which would fail soon thereafter. They\'d have  amazing platinum plaques and credentials, but when they start their own  place, they fail HORRIBLY. They often had more musical talent than  management/business talent and would faceplant. Also, when normal people  would see the success of one studio, they want to start their own and  reproduce it; who wouldn\'t want to make their living recording cool  music all day?\n\nI was talking to  someone who used to work at a place like sweetwater, one of those venues  that sells equipment to all of the wannabes. Something stuck with me  that I\'ll never forget.  They told me, "you don\'t make money off the  dream of opening a studio. You make money \\*selling the dream of opening a  studio."\\* Sell the equipment. The fiberglass for panels. The preamps.  The console. The high end, tube U47 microphones. The setup of the  facility, all that jazz. Regardless of whether the studio does amazingly  well or fails entirely, you made your money. During a time of so many  people\'s home studio businesses recording people for cheap on craigslist  failing, so many professional studios failing, retailers of the  products necessary to set up said facility were doing amazing. Selling  the dream, generates more stable income than chasing the dream.\n\nLet\'s  transfer that analogy to new infrastructure plans, green energy  startups, solar/EV companies, wind energy companies, etc. There\'s going  to be an infrastructure plan regarding green energy coming out, unless  Biden was fibbing about a 2T plan to tackle climate change, which is  hard to believe with a Democratic house &amp; senate. To try and guess  which companies that will benefit, when they will start making profit,  whether they will go tits up or do well, and whether they are currently  in a bubble, that\'s too much for my small brain. To try and \\*time\\* it -  is even harder. Is ICLN going back down to $18 because it\'s a bubble  before it goes to $30 when Biden begins his 2T plan, or is it going to  $100 before he announces it? What car company will do best? Is TSLA  overvalued at its humble 1500 PE and about to get spanked by some  surprise Ford or GM comes out with, or is TSLA going to make 10000 PE  the new norm by this time next year? Timing this and picking a company,  as well as when bubbles will burst, is impossible. I don\'t have the  brain for it.\n\nOne thing is for  sure - every single one of them, will need copper. Copper is an  excellent conductor. Low resistance, low oxidation, cheap. It doesn\'t  \\*matter\\* whether the  company makes billions, or goes tits up. It  doesn\'t \\*matter\\* if a specific solar panel company makes great panels  and sells record numbers, or shit panels that all get recalled. In order  for them to even get started living the dream, someone needs to sell  them the commodities necessary to get started. Before they create, much  less sell, a single marketable product, they have to buy the copper.\n\nWe  combine this with another tailwind, the US dollar going to shit. The  dollar appears to be getting obilterated. Stimulus is going everywhere,  federal reserve balance sheet is exploding with seemingly no end in  sight. Inflation occurs as a result of two things - adding more to the  money supply, and a drop in production of goods/services. If huge swaths  of entire industries/jobs are considered "not essential" by politicians  for extended periods of time, you have a loss in production. If people  get sick and cannot produce as a result, you have a loss of production.  and if you have seemingly endless QE, money printer go brrr means more  money everywhere - to buy up a limited number of goods and services. The  result, is inflation.\n\nI am seeing  copper as a green energy + inflation play that is less risky than  speculating on any one particular company or fund. As someone who  believes inflation will get worse, and that green energy is the future, I  think copper is a bullish play. I am not quite sure the best way to  take advantage of this, if this is the case. I\'m more sharing this to  get criticism &amp; ideas from others than to actually give advice. I  own shares of a few copper ETFs right now and some ICLN, at the time of  this posting, and am not trying to give advice, but rather find holes in  my thesis so I can make better investment decisions.\n\n**TL;DR;  My theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper  to soar more than it has, and continue soaring. Is this a good  investment thesis, and if so, how can I best capitalize on it?**\n\nReasons:\n\n**1) Government subsidies/spending directed towards solar/wind/EV/clean energy companies causing a boom in demand of copper.**\n\n**2) Endless moneyprinting + shortage of copper from the pandemic/lockdowns pushing up the price of copper.**\n\n**3) New infrastructure plans backed by the federal government &amp; pushing up the demand &amp; price for copper.**'), ('Real life TSLA Gainz', 'Real life TSLA Gainz'), ('Some basic TSLA Tech Analysis for you Smooth-Brained Apes', 'Some basic TSLA Tech Analysis for you Smooth-Brained ApesSo, TSLA, along w/ the rest of the Tech stocks is on a downward trajectory, which leads to the obvious question: When does it stop so I can buy in and maximize my upside potential?\n\nI took a look at some historical Moving Averages to get an idea of how far this may go and my initial conclusions are below:\n\n1. Crashed through the 50-day SMA on 21 Feb and has stayed &gt;10% below since.  This MA has historically been TSLA\'s support level and staying below leads me to think it may be here a while.\n2. 100-day SMA is the next logical support level, which is $625 so I\'ll be watching closely to see if the downward trajectory continues at the same rate, or starts to level out as it approaches that 100-day SMA support level.\n\nThe stock is at $688 now so that 100-day SMA isn\'t really far off and it could rebound sharply so set your alerts and/or limits, raid your wife\'s boyfriend\'s wallet, and hang on for a fun, and potentially lucrative opportunity.

But turns out, [he follows pretty much the same strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/economy/biden-china.html).

I fucked up my timing, I bought them 2 hours before market open because I didn\'t know Powell was talking yesterday. Averaged down by buying calls at open as well. I think now the inflation concerns are priced in. The worse case scenario is NOT though but there\'s a very small probability that inflation will actually create an economic meltdown.\n\nI expect to keep my calls for at least a month or two. But I will revise my plan if the situation changes (and I will update you anyways).\n\n--------------------------------\n*I hope you liked this one.

There was always hype around a record label or some famous producer  opening their new studio, which would fail soon thereafter. They\'d have  amazing platinum plaques and credentials, but when they start their own  place, they fail HORRIBLY. They often had more musical talent than  management/business talent and would faceplant. Also, when normal people  would see the success of one studio, they want to start their own and  reproduce it; who wouldn\'t want to make their living recording cool  music all day?\n\nI was talking to  someone who used to work at a place like sweetwater, one of those venues  that sells equipment to all of the wannabes. Something stuck with me  that I\'ll never forget.  They told me, "you don\'t make money off the  dream of opening a studio. You make money \\*selling the dream of opening a  studio."\\* Sell the equipment. The fiberglass for panels. The preamps.  The console. The high end, tube U47 microphones. The setup of the  facility, all that jazz. Regardless of whether the studio does amazingly  well or fails entirely, you made your money. During a time of so many  people\'s home studio businesses recording people for cheap on craigslist  failing, so many professional studios failing, retailers of the  products necessary to set up said facility were doing amazing. Selling  the dream, generates more stable income than chasing the dream.\n\nLet\'s  transfer that analogy to new infrastructure plans, green energy  startups, solar/EV companies, wind energy companies, etc. There\'s going  to be an infrastructure plan regarding green energy coming out, unless  Biden was fibbing about a 2T plan to tackle climate change, which is  hard to believe with a Democratic house &amp; senate. To try and guess  which companies that will benefit, when they will start making profit,  whether they will go tits up or do well, and whether they are currently  in a bubble, that\'s too much for my small brain. To try and \\*time\\* it -  is even harder. Is ICLN going back down to $18 because it\'s a bubble  before it goes to $30 when Biden begins his 2T plan, or is it going to  $100 before he announces it? What car company will do best? Is TSLA  overvalued at its humble 1500 PE and about to get spanked by some  surprise Ford or GM comes out with, or is TSLA going to make 10000 PE  the new norm by this time next year? Timing this and picking a company,  as well as when bubbles will burst, is impossible. I don\'t have the  brain for it.\n\nOne thing is for  sure - every single one of them, will need copper. Copper is an  excellent conductor. Low resistance, low oxidation, cheap. It doesn\'t  \\*matter\\* whether the  company makes billions, or goes tits up. It  doesn\'t \\*matter\\* if a specific solar panel company makes great panels  and sells record numbers, or shit panels that all get recalled. In order  for them to even get started living the dream, someone needs to sell  them the commodities necessary to get started. Before they create, much  less sell, a single marketable product, they have to buy the copper.\n\nWe  combine this with another tailwind, the US dollar going to shit. The  dollar appears to be getting obilterated. Stimulus is going everywhere,  federal reserve balance sheet is exploding with seemingly no end in  sight. Inflation occurs as a result of two things - adding more to the  money supply, and a drop in production of goods/services. If huge swaths  of entire industries/jobs are considered "not essential" by politicians  for extended periods of time, you have a loss in production. If people  get sick and cannot produce as a result, you have a loss of production.  and if you have seemingly endless QE, money printer go brrr means more  money everywhere - to buy up a limited number of goods and services. The  result, is inflation.\n\nI am seeing  copper as a green energy + inflation play that is less risky than  speculating on any one particular company or fund. As someone who  believes inflation will get worse, and that green energy is the future, I  think copper is a bullish play. I am not quite sure the best way to  take advantage of this, if this is the case. I\'m more sharing this to  get criticism &amp; ideas from others than to actually give advice. I  own shares of a few copper ETFs right now and some ICLN, at the time of  this posting, and am not trying to give advice, but rather find holes in  my thesis so I can make better investment decisions.\n\n**TL;DR;  My theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper  to soar more than it has, and continue soaring.

This MA has historically been TSLA\'s support level and staying below leads me to think it may be here a while.\n2. 100-day SMA is the next logical support level, which is $625 so I\'ll be watching closely to see if the downward trajectory continues at the same rate, or starts to level out as it approaches that 100-day SMA support level.\n\nThe stock is at $688 now so that 100-day SMA isn\'t really far off and it could rebound sharply so set your alerts and/or limits, raid your wife\'s boyfriend\'s wallet, and hang on for a fun, and potentially lucrative opportunity.

Right there should be your biggest clue that those risks are priced in but I can give you more reasons.\n\nBut first, let me be clear on one point : This is a long term risk, not a short term one. The market will not crash tomorrow nor in the coming months but it can decrease the growth of the stock market. Or in the most extreme case cause a bear market or a crash.\n\nBut it seems like there are some confusion on reddit on what inflation we\'re talking about. So read this 10 times :\n\n*The Inflation risks are not on consumer prices but on the stock market.*\n\nRead it again! Again I said! And keep reading it because I\'m sick of reading posts about that. Those risks of increase in consumer spendings are WAY overblown and frankly non-existant.\n\nThis is because the average consumer didn\'t receive much money from the government in the last year. And the little money he did receive, he used it to either buy stuff that he would have bought anyway or buy stuff for leisure purposes. "*But have you seen Amazon\'s revenue?*" you might say. "*Yes, I\'ve seen it*" I would reply. Part of this revenue growth was due to AWS (their cloud business) and people being online more than ever during the pandemic, so server costs ballooned! \n\nBut I grant you that : there was a big increase in consumption (on e-commerce especially) BUT it was mostly due to people being stuck in their home : they didn\'t travel, didn\'t party or anything like that, so they used that excess money to buy stuff online. Also, they were pretty bored at home and buying stuff was a few clicks away so of course they\'d buy useless stuffs. There were other stuffs that impacted consumer spendings like people moving outside of big cities and making their home more confortable to live in (because you know, they\'re stuck at home).\n\nSo, when countries reopen, this trend will probably slow down (although it\'s setting a shift in consumer spending from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce but that\'s another story).\n\nAnd with the [US exports increasing during the pandemic](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/exports), the dollar increases enough in value to offset potential inflation risks.\n\nSo yeah, this inflation was never really a concern, but now let\'s talk about the stock market inflation concerns that most institutions were worried about.\n\nThe concern is as follow :\n\n&gt; FED buys bonds and gives money to companies, banks and hedge funds. Hedge funds and banks put this money in the stock market. Stock market goes up artificially thanks to all that money. Companies use this to compensate for missed revenue. Their financials don\'t look so bad because of all the money given to them. But, nothing is organic, everything is given by the FED and this might create a giant bubble that\'s ready to burst.\n\nOk, so a few things about that :\n\n- The stock market being stretched is nothing new, it\'s been a bubble "ready to burst" for a decade or so.\n- The tech sector did very well without the need of quantitative easing.\n- The actual thing you should worry about is not a market crash or a bear market but rather a *reduced growth*. That\'s why value stocks went up or flattened these past two weeks when growth stocks plunged. Most companies will increase in value but since a much bigger growth was priced in for growth stocks, their stock prices went down. By the way, that\'s why Tesla\'s stock price went down, that had nothing to do with its 1.5bn bet. \n- And for the concerns regarding all this money given to companies, there\'s not that much to worry about. When the economy recovers (in my opinion slowly from end-2021 to mid-2022), companies will generate revenue organically and as the economy gets better, MoneyPrinterMan will *progressively* reduce his bond buying program and *slowly* go on phase 2 of his plan : actually combating the inflation if it becomes a concern by then. \n\nThere might be a correction at some point but hedge funds still have a shit ton of money to invest. And they\'re not going to keep it in cash when we have a massive bull market like that.\n\nAnd I\'ll finish this rant by quoting our great savior Mr. MoneyPrinterMan Powell :\n\n&gt; Fuck your puts.\n\nAlso, there\'s [an article that explains this very well](https://www.im.natixis.com/en-ch/markets/post-pandemic-inflation-risk-2021).\n\nOk now let\'s talk about Powell speech for a minute.\n\n**Powell talked. Investors were not impressed**\n\nSummary of the speech tuesday : Hey bulls, nothing new, keep buying!\n\nSeriously, that\'s it!\n\nHe said he will keep buying bonds at the current pace because the economy has still not recovered as much as he would like. \n\nHe said that the inflation concerns are overblown.\n\nThen senators asked about racial inequalities and Powell basically said "wtf I\'m just the chairman of the FED not the fucking president." (I\'m paraphrasing a little) Although he aknowledged the problem, he didn\'t give any solution because well as he said it very well, he\'s "not the fucking president" (again paraphrasing a little ;)).\n\nThe Senator Kennedy asked "*Do you think we ought to go Catwoman on the budget and actually look for savings there?*" (yes he actually said that, I\'m NOT paraphrasing here). Powell said he didn\'t know the reference (and frankly I don\'t fully understand what that meant either).\n\n[Link of the video and transcript](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/ux2lCF7KhCxCaP893gBjj6a3vD6H8wjZ47XZ56eLOD_bCvbSROyURMo4XtKOMy8-K2LB3wZ87l89r0ELEMVOJYvebgU)\n\nHe also talked about unemployment rates and that... Ah! That was pretty interesting. But today\'s recap is already long enough. Tomorrow, you\'ll get my "quick" thoughts on that (spoiler alert : it\'s not quick).\n\n**C3.ai is a must buy more than ever!**\n\nThis is a short one because I\'ve talked about this company in a previous daily recap. So I encourage you to read it first.\n\nBut now, I think this is the best time to buy the stock as it went down a lot recently (it\'s a growth stock and all growth stocks went down the past week or so). \n\nBut there\'s something that you might know : Chinese competition in the Big Data Analytics space was and is still going strong. The Chinese government is tracking everyone down which generates a lot of data, the chinese government gives chinese companies carte blanche on all fronts even if they become monopolies. And they do.\n\n[Here\'s a paper written in 2015 on how big the industry is in China](https://www.afcdud.com/fr/transport-afcdud/387-bigdatachina.html). \n\nBut something might change that. I really don\'t want to talk politics here so let\'s make it brief : Trump went hard on China and planned on continuing that way and people thought Biden would not go as hard.

There\'s more detail to it, I encourage you to read the article and be informed on the situation.\n\nSo, this *might* be the moment where chinese companies get a big hit. They will probably get the same treatment as american companies and their big advantage will disappear.\n\nAnyway, so my point is this : My DD on C3.AI still stands and the potential regulation on China gives you another reason to buy (long term).\n\n**Here\'s a list of luxury brand companies**\n\n2 days ago, I wrote that companies selling luxury goods *that hold their value* are hot right now. Here\'s a curated list of companies that I think will benefit the most from people buying luxury goods :\n\n- Watches of Switzerland Group (it had a good run but it still has a lot of potential and it\'s a better bet than the others imo)\n- Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA\n- LVMH\n- Ralph Lauren Corp\n\nAlso, [a good article that talks about that](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-23/-unstoppable-luxury-stocks-remind-some-investors-of-u-s-tech).\n\n# Quick Update on my portfolio\n\nLast week I was cash gang up until yesterday where I bought spy calls expiring in June.

I  own shares of a few copper ETFs right now and some ICLN, at the time of  this posting, and am not trying to give advice, but rather find holes in  my thesis so I can make better investment decisions.\n\n**TL;DR;  My theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper  to soar more than it has, and continue soaring. Is this a good  investment thesis, and if so, how can I best capitalize on it?**\n\nReasons:\n\n**1) Government subsidies/spending directed towards solar/wind/EV/clean energy companies causing a boom in demand of copper.**\n\n**2) Endless moneyprinting + shortage of copper from the pandemic/lockdowns pushing up the price of copper.**\n\n**3) New infrastructure plans backed by the federal government &amp; pushing up the demand &amp; price for copper.**')], '2021-02-26': [('Why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run [Long post]', "Why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run [Long post]TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.\n\n# Premise:\n\nEquities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.\n\nBut let me try to explain nonetheless.\n\n1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn‚Äôt have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn‚Äôt have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.\n2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.\n3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.\n4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&amp;P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)\n   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.\n   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.\n      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.\n5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).\n6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.\n7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.\n   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income.\n8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nUsing my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:\n\nThis is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.\n\nThus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.\n\n^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)\n\nRisk of my predictions being completely off the mark.\n\n* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.\n* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.\n* Black swan events.\n* Think of something yourself man!

So, in short, negative GEX numbers create volatility while positive GEX numbers inhibit volatility. " Remember when I said this is the second-lowest GEX EVER?

Index funds end up underweight GME  \n3. They must fix this before May/June, or losses are locked in  \n4. Tendies   \n\n\nSo I was sucking on the Frosty machine at Wendy's when I decided to look into what it might mean for GME when it moves from the Russell 2000 (small cap) to the Russell 1000 (large cap) in May and June.  This typically doesn't mean much for a single stock, but with the volatility we've seen with GME already, as well as the percentage change in market cap, I think this may be more significant for GME than most companies.\n\nFTSE Russell does a big giant rebanlacing that lasts about two months in May and June.  Link here for the 2020 schedule. [https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule](https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule) .  The 2021 dates aren't released yet but should be basically the same.  Because of the recent run-up in price on GME, it is set for a move from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000.  This same price increase also left many active fund managers underweight in GME, and they are losing out on recent gains.\n\nAll of this means Russell 2000 active fund managers who are underweight in GME right now, only have about 2-3 months to attempt to fix it before it gets taken out of the index, and their under performance on GME gets locked in.  It's quite possible that they are helping to form a large part of the floor, and their increasingly desperate attempts to not have the underweight GME locked in at re-balancing time will cause more and more volatility as the deadline approaches.\n\n A recent comparison I would like to make is to TSLA, both because of its retail popularity, short interest, and volatility leading up to SP500 inclusion.  S&amp;P announced that TSLA would be added to the index on Nov. 17, 2020, and it was officially added on Dec. 21. In that time, it's stock price went from $441 to $649, with an overall increase in market cap of over $200 billion dollars.  With a current market cap of around $5-10 Billion dollars depending on the day, it takes a lot less money to move the price on GME, and with the high likelihood of underweight Russell 2000 index funds, we may see even more volatility leading up May/June than we have so far this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure - I am long GME.

You‚Äôve heard about the GME volatility and *YOU WANT IN*! Fine, that‚Äôs great, welcome to the party. But there are some **VERY** important things to keep in mind as you‚Äôre learning how to trade with this crazy high volatility.\n\n\nLesson 1: *The Market*\n\nKeep in mind as you‚Äôre trading, that volatility like this is not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. At least it wasn‚Äôt before Covid, and it likely won‚Äôt be after. This can be a good or bad thing. Good if you can make some money, bad because you can lose a lot more money in a much shorter period of time. For a little more info, here‚Äôs a link to another post I made [explaining market halts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls8xjy/some_basic_stock_info_for_you_new_degenerates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)‚ÄúBut wait‚Äù, you say, ‚ÄúI want to make **MORE** money even **FASTER**! These 10% rises in shares just isn‚Äôt enough!‚Äù. Great! Yes, there are other *options* available for you to do that, but remember, that comes with greater risk. \n\n\nLesson 2: *Options* \n\nSo you‚Äôve heard of options now have you. Okay, that‚Äôs fine. But **BE CAREFUL**! Options carry a LOT of risk with them. Instead of losing ~10% of your investment when your shares decrease 10%, if you have a contract for a stock to hit a certain price (the *strike price*) by a certain point, you could either make or lose multiple times the % change of the stock movement.\n\nSo, say you have a call contract (you think the price will go up) for, let‚Äôs say GME to hit $200 by March 5th. That contract is worth roughly $1.25/ share, meaning it would cost $125 as each contract is multiplied by 100 shares. Now let‚Äôs say on Monday, GME hits the price of $205/ share. Congratulations! Your contract is ITM (in the money). \n\nNow you have 3 options. You can sell the contract for that new premium price, which is likely massive and you‚Äôre looking at likely over 3,000% gains on your investment. You can hold the contract and hope it goes up more before Friday, OR you can now exercise the contract, meaning if you have the funds, you can buy 100 shares of GME at your $200 strike price, despite the current price being $205. \n\nOkay now let‚Äôs say you buy the same contract, but the price falls from the current price of ~$100, down to $60. Instead of losing the 40% from the stock going down, you‚Äôre now looking at a loss of probably nearing 80 or 90%, with very little chance of it going up to $200 in the remaining time you have left for your contract. \n\nThis is where you have a couple options. You can sell, and take your losses. You can sell, and roll your contracts out to a further expiration date, OR you can hold that contract on the off chance you could make some of that money back by expiration, though by then you could have lost 100% of your investment.\n\n\nNow here are some general guidelines when trading options:\n\n**1.** *Take your gains*. Especially if you‚Äôre looking at 1,000%+ gains, this rarely happens and is quite an impressive return. You never lose when you take profits. If you‚Äôre experienced, and know the price could go up even more, make your own choice with what risk is acceptable to you.\n\n**2.** **STAY AWAY FROM FD‚Äôs** (weekly options contracts)! The Greeks on these are just too high for any new folks to make decent money on. (Theta decay is NOT your friend)\n\n**3.** Roll your contracts out a few weeks, and look at leaps as a potential play as well. Leaps allow you to hold a contract for up to a couple years, giving you ample time to make some money, or recover losses from a dip.\n\n**4.** Do your own DD (Due Diligence). You will read a lot of shit on this sub. Before you make a choice on what to buy, do your own research.\n\n**5.** The real DD is always in the comments. Think of DD as someone trying to sell you something, often times, the folks in the comments have nothing to gain from telling the truth, so you‚Äôll read different perspectives in the comments about a stock.\n\nI know this is a lot to read, but it‚Äôs important, especially for all you new folks. But here‚Äôs a TL,DR for all you smooth brains.\n\n**TL,DR: don‚Äôt trade weeklies unless you know what you‚Äôre doing, Don‚Äôt FOMO your portfolio when you‚Äôre worried about being left out of a run up, and take your profits to reinvest, or simply to have.**\n\nPositions: 3/5 GME $80c, 50 shares at $47, some Tesla and SPY calls.'), ('SPY to 180, 75k in VIX calls and SPX puts, this market is crashing with no survivors', 'SPY to 180, 75k in VIX calls and SPX puts, this market is crashing with no survivors'), ('$FUBO - Sports Streaming + Sports Betting All in One App', '$FUBO - Sports Streaming + Sports Betting All in One App$FUBO is a sports based streaming service that\'s now rolling out their own sportsbook.\n\nStream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.\n\nER is coming Tuesday of next week.

They\'re not going to be given a ticket to the feed trough   of free taxpayer money (supposing somebody informs Buyden that by chip    shortage, they\'re not indicating he needs to send his interns to  the   snack aisle of the grocery store to hoard.  Not a sure thing).\n\nWhat   we\'re going to be talking about are the lower grade ASIC (application   specific chips) that are used more in infrastructure.  These are the   commodity level products that are used for things like the computers in   vehicles, mobile phones, wireless towers, specialized digital binary   money mining, and so Elon can implant them in chimps for evil genius   mind control experiments.\n\n***Placeholder:  Chart for expected 5G tower growth***\n\n***Placeholder:  Chart for automotive chip demands and supply bottleneck; chart to Q3)***\n\nYour   bigger players here are going to be Taiwan Semi ($TSMC), Lam ($LRCX),   and ST ($STM).  2 of them are boring to trade, and Lam I\'m not allowed   to talk about because of a conflict of interest w/ my VC.\n\n# Let\'s talk about the government for a minute\n\nOK,   be honest:  Half the reason you\'re here is because you heard Buyden is   going to dump loads of free money into these companies so they\'ll make   more chips.    After all, that\'s what CNBC has told you, and they  never  lie, right?  Right?  That\'s actually not what has happened in  Washington  (and, god help us, that line about Buyden thinking the chip  shortage  has to do with potatoes was only half joking).  What the  government has  done was signed up to spend money STUDYING why there\'s a  chip shortage.   The concern here is that even the US based semis  outsource out their  chip production to places like China and Vietnam,  and there\'s a growing  push to incentivize companies to bring production  domestically.  This is  especially spurred by $NXPI, who is  bottlenecking the automotive  industry by selling too much overseas.   Now, let\'s be honest:  It\'s  about 75% that all they do is waste money  on the study and never  actually make the investment, because getting  things like this done is  hard, and it\'s much easier to focus on social  issues that are already  covered by other laws but make it look like  something is getting done.   We have talkers and not doers right now,  that\'s just the nature of the  beast.\n\nSpeaking of, let\'s talk about....\n\n# $NXPI - The Laggard\n\n$NXPI   represents the only true foreign company we\'re going to examine today,   based in the Netherlands.  $MRVL is technically based in Bermuda, but   they\'re a US company (more on that later).  At the time of this  writing,  they\'re trading in the low 180\'s with a market cap of about 51  billion.   Their specialty is in chips that power infotainment systems  for cars.   So when you hear $F whine about how they can\'t get enough  chips,  they\'re low-key throwing shade at $NXPI.  The only reason  they\'re being  included in this list is because, as a big automotive  chipmaker, in  spite of the whole "Buy American" virtuing from the  current government,  if they spend money to ramp up manufacturing,  they\'re going to hand  money to $NXPI to set up factories here - and  will be dumb enough to not  make it contingent upon $NXPI keeping the  chips here in the country, so  they\'ll continue to sell them to the rest  of the world.\n\nLooking  under the  hood, 47% of their money comes from cars, another 13% comes  from  phones, 20% comes from infrastructure (think wireless towers) and  about  20% of their money comes from selling chips to AMazon and Google  so  their virtual assistants can spy on you and listen to your wife\'s   boyfriend having sex on your dining table, with his balls rubbing right   against where your plate of Hungry Man frozen dinners sits when ~~he takes her out on a date~~   she goes out "with the girls".  Hey, I think one of those peas fell on   the table.  Pick it up and put it in your mouth.  Yeah, roll it around   in there, tastes like taint, doesn\'t it?  They\'re b asically a smaller   representation of Trevor\'s nuts - or a life size version of yours, you   dirty little bitch.  So one could say they\'ve got a pretty good  product  mix and were one of the earlier players in the sector to  recover (yet  still lagged behind them overall), unlike the other  players we\'re gonna  talk about later.    Or, you could say that they\'re  a bunch of flip  flopping non-committers who create a schizophrenic  company in some weird  attempt to not be cyclical.  They trade at a  lower multiple to their  competitors, but this is largely due to the  fact that they\'re leveraged  more deeply than the rest.  The best  comparison to these guys would be $TXN if  you want something else to  track it by\n\n**(Placeholder:  I might put a chart here later in an edit that compares price in relation to EBITDA)**\n\n**(Placeholder:    I might put a chart here later in an edit that shows forward earnings   estimations based upon the increase in auto and IoT chip costs)**\n\nWhat  do they think they\'re going to be long term?  That\'s the thing, it\'s  impossible to  tell if they\'re going to become a big player in cars or  IoT (they\'re not  compelling in infrastructure) because....\n\nWhat   makes $NXPI interesting here in spite of the fact that everybody is   pissed at them for spreading themselves too thin is the fact that   they\'re such whores with who they sell to that they\'ve become something   of an interesting M&amp;A speculative play, as it\'s entirely possible a   company just comes along and buys them to bolster their supply chain  for  chips once and for all.  In particular, there is a strong  indication  that Samsung has been kicking the tires for over a year.\n\nOK, moving $ON (get it?  Dad joke)\n\n# $ON - The Overachiever\n\n$On   represents the only true domestic semi on this list, so if you\'re   playing the "corporate welfare" trade, you\'ll be interested here.  If   $NXPI is the BPD-afflicted ex who "loves strongly and that\'s why she lit   your car on fire", $ON is that super-focused new girlfriend who\'s   dating you because she knows somewhere in your contact list is a local   celebrity she can use to get her closer to being the Bachelorette after   she dumps your ass.  ON is all-in on 2 things:  the vehicle revolution   and 5G.  They\'re positioning themselves as the place to go to if you\'re   making EV\'s or autonomous cars, as they are focused on LIDAR sensory   chips and power management.  Why?  It\'s simple - ON was, is, and always   will be, interested in the highest margin businesses possible, cyclical   nature of them be damned.  Sure, they stick the tip of their johnson  in  the industrial sector, cross-selling their sensory chips for  purposes of  machine vision (think automated Amazon warehouse part  pickers), but  it\'s not something they spend a lot of time on.  Does  this strategy work  (at least for right now?).  Let\'s look under the  hood.\n\nThey  had a MASSIVE beat  last quarter and then upgraded forward guidance by  8%, and this stonk  has already had quite a run - more than 30% to date,  which has outpaced  its competitors by almost double.  The automotive  section of their  portfolio rose 17% and represents about 33% of their  revenue at this  point, but it\'s clear to see that if we have this  conversation in a  year, that number will be well over 50%.  Their  infrastructure revenue  (wireless towers) lagged, but that was due to  their vendors, and  actually represents a forward opportunity.  They beat  in spite of a  major part of their portfolio dumping.  So the answer is  yes.\n\nHow?    Simple:  Mind control and cancer technology from the lizard people   who\'s secret society is bustling under the ice of Antarctica, aka 5G.    The telecoms, as a result of the virus, really slowed down their rollout   of 5G last year.  It was suspected that might carry through this year,   as well.  You may have noticed the news a day or two ago that $T and  $VZ  caught downgrades because of unexpectedly high prices paid in the  most  recent bandwidth spectrum auctions.  That changes all of that.   Since  everybody had to pay so much more for the spectrum space, look  for these  players to be very aggressive in trying to shorten the ROI  frame on  those expenses by aggressively expanding out their 5G  infrastructure.   There are 3 companies that this is very good news for:   $SWKS (another  stock I can\'t comment on because of conflict of  interest, so do your own  DD with them), $ON, and the next participant  in this, which we\'ll get  to in a moment.  So there are about to be a  lot more chips from $ON in  your kid\'s school, shooting ovarian cancer  rays into that boy.  You  likely won\'t see this reflected on the balance  sheet until their Q3  earnings, but since everybody knows it\'s coming,  it\'s going to get baked  into the price.  Which is why you\'re very  likely to see a melt up over  the next months.\n\nThe   one thing that sets $ON apart from the rest of the equities on this   list is that they\'re not a a mini-fab.  That meaning, they\'re not a   company that simply outsources chip production to other people   (overseas) and who has shown a willingness to keep some production in   house.  Matter of fact, their CEO recently came out and affirmed that he   wants to maintain a balance between outsourcing and in-house.  Which   means when it\'s time to get some of that sweet, sweet taxpayer money to   build out US production, they\'ll have their hands out.\n\nTL:DR:    If you\'re bullish on EV\'s, self-driving cars, and the Illuminati,   you\'re bullish on $ON.  If you\'re playing the gubmint corporate cheese   play, $ON\n\n# $MRVL - The Duke Brothers\n\nMarvell   is functionally a US company (Santa Clara), but is technically   headquartered in Bermuda because they\'re filthy tax dodgers.  If you\'re   one of those "ethical investors", stay far away from this company,   because they\'re as dirty as they come in a lot of ways. They also trade   at a lower multiple than the others.  On the upside, if the government   starts offering money to "Build American, sell to China", they will   elbow their way to the front of the line to take the free money...and   then build a 3 person operation somewhere in Iowa that makes hard drive   chips and pocket the rest, which will definitely pad their bottom line.\n\nOne   thing that\'s different with $MRVL here is that they completely   outsource their chip production right now, so if they were to take   government money, they would have to build their infrastructure from the   ground up and figure out how to make it work.  Anyways, let\'s look   under the hood:\n\n40%  of their  revenue comes from the storage sector.  Meaning the lion\'s  share of  their money is legacy, selling chips that go in hard drives.   On the  consumer side, it\'s in platter discs, their SSD play is in the   enterprise space because they\'re not high performance chips.    BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-RIIIIIIIIING.   "But NrdRage!", I can hear you saying   "That means they\'re gonna be huge in the cloooooouuuuuuud!".   Sure,   except margins in t he cloud computing space keep shrinking at   exponential rates as it becomes more commoditized, so it\'s a lot like   investing in EMC in 2014.  They\'ve invested heavily in automotive in the   last year, but they\'re a day late and a billion dollars short there.    It will take at least 3 years before that investment starts bearing   fruit, so they\'re not an interesting play in that aspect, and likely   would use that free taxpayer money to try and close their gap there,   because they weren\'t forward thinking in that regard.  They\'ve been   active in acquisitions lately, most recently buying Inphi, which serves   to just attempt to keep up with $NVDA in the ARM chip space for data   centers.  For the record, they cannot keep up with $NVDA in that space,   so don\'t think you\'re paying for a dominant player there.    It\'s a  high  profit sector, but not exciting and dependent on their continued   contract winning in the whitebox space.  All this sounds like they\'re   big spenders, but that\'s not really true.  They\'ve actually been   excessively cautious in leveraging debt, which is why they\'re so far   behind in the auto space.  As only 4 or 5% of their revenue came from   things like industrial or IoT, MRVL is actively winding down t hose   sectors of their business, and abandoning t hem.\n\nWhat   they are that\'s interesting, however, is almost exclusively a 5G play,   and in that regard, they are fucking rock stars.   5G alone represents   about a billion dollars per quarter as things get more heated there,   because they\'re not just a domestic 5G play - they\'re really well   positioned to be the dominant chip maker in both the Land of the Hentai   Sun and for the Europoors.  If you\'re investing in $MRVL, this is the   SOLE reason you\'re doing so, and it\'s a compelling case.  There\'s no   chart data I can provide as-yet that can accurately project their   positioning in the market in this area, but rest assured, when that data   can be quantified, they\'re going to be a big time player in it.   Matter  of fact, just yesterday they announced they were partnering with   Fujitsu in a 5G baseband agreement with regards to Fujitsu\'s base   stations.  Bad day to announce that news, since the best performing   stonks were the ones that only closed down 1%.\n\n**(Placeholder:  Chart goes here for 5G chip earnings and market share)**\n\n**(Placeholder:  Chart goes here for telecom expansion analysis)**\n\n# So, to summarize:\n\n* The   entire sector is very cyclical, and presently it represents a perfect   storm of an upgrade in telecommunications technology, automotive   advancements, and IoT\n* Don\'t   bet on them just because you hear Buyden is virtue signalling some   bullshit about solving Ford\'s chip crisis, because it\'s probably going   to be another example of lifetime politicians being all talk and no   action\n* They\'re   all healthy financially, none of them are heavily shorted, and  pressure  is to the upside, albeit not in any sort of extreme adrenaline releasing way\n* If   you really want to bet on government, the real bet here is the stimmy   money getting handed out again.  DC is basically telling everybody to  go  buy a new phone with the next installment of checks, and those  phones  are going to be 5G capable and the people are going to want to  leverage  that.\n* Don\'t tell the lizard people I know about their secret base\n\n# That\'s all well and good, fucker, but how do I play them?  Can I FD?\n\n$NXPI:    You actually can.  You can expect daily movement of between 2-4% with   some regularity, with a ITM Delta of about 58 and a Gamma approaching 2   and a half (spoiler alert: All these are going to have garbage gammas,   just a nature of the industry).  Don\'t go crazy out of the money, but   weeklies are absolutely something you can do here.\n\n$ON:    You can\'t really.  This is really more of a melt up play.  You don\'t   necessarily have to play leaps, but weeklies are gonna be a bad idea.    Stay close to in the money and go 2 or 3 months out at a time.    Currently I\'m sitting on 4/16 41c\'s, which I will roll over into June   calls as we get closer to expiration.  You always want to stay a little   in front of these dudes.  ITM Delta is almost always sub-50 and Gamma  is  often times about 12 short term.  Stay a little ahead of them and it   improves dramatically.\n\n$MRVL:    They\'re OK there, but like $ON, you\'re probably going to want to stay   ahead of them, though you can fiddle with this a bit.  Delta is pretty   good, but the gamma is absolute dogshit.  If you target something about   10% one direction or another, you should be happy as long as you pick   the right side of the coin flip.\n\n# Outlook and Price Targets:\n\n$NXPI:    I\'m neutral on them, bordering on bullish.  They\'re the biggest  reason  we keep hearing about this silicon crisis right now, but they\'re  being  coy about whether the reason they\'re not keeping up is because  they  don\'t or won\'t produce enough or if it\'s just because they won\'t  sell  enough to us.  They represent a potential speculative play if  somebody  who really needs chips for their business decides to just  solve the  problem by throwing money at it and bringing that development  in house.   3 month price target 200-210.\n\n$ON:    Bullish.  They\'re laser focused and well positioned to take advantage   of all the highest margin business in this cycle, and as the demand  for  these products ramps up, their outlook is going to exponentially  outpace  everybody else in the space, even the chips I didn\'t talk about  today  (exempting gaming chip makers).  45 in the short term, but if  you manage  to stick your dick in your wife when she\'s sleeping one  night and  dribble your Downs-afflicted swimmers into her, you could  very well see  75-80 by the time that chromosome hoarding bundle of joy  licks your  wife\'s vag.  I expect to see this one in triple digits at  some point.  A  darling.\n\n$MRVL:    Bullish for 5G ONLY.  Once you start seeing the telecoms advertise   they\'ve got 97% nationwide 5G coverage (and research studies to back   that up), their cycle will be over and they\'ll go back to legacy   revenue, but expect big things from them as $T and $VZ try to keep up   with T-Mo\'s breakneck pace.  Short term price of $75, long term...eh,   whatever.\n\n# Positions:\n\n$NXPI:   I don\'t hold a position with them, and don\'t anticipate doing so  unless a strong momentum trade forms.  I think they can move, but  they\'re not interesting to me.  Some of you will like them, especially  since you can FD them because of the occasional spikes and craters.\n\n$ON:    1000 4/16 $41cs and 500 7/16 44c\'s.  I also have 85,000 shares at   30.59.  I grabbed some weeklies for next week at 38 during yesterday\'s   bloodbath, but that was just me feeling cute.  You can\'t really shadow   trade that since it\'s already back up to 40.25.\n\n$MRVL:  2000 5/21 $65c\'s and 50,000 shares at 33.35\n\n# NRDRAGE DOUBLE FEATURE:  BONUS "DD": $UTZ\n\nI   keep making those "Buyden hears chip shortage and thinks Frito Lay is   in trouble" jokes, but the thing is, I\'m only half kidding.    That has   nothing to do with this equity other than it got me thinking about my   favorite snack brands.  A week ago, I had no idea this company was even   publicly traded -  I always knew them as a family run northeast niche   thing.  One thing I did notice, however, was a couple of years ago  their  chips started showing up in grocery stores near my Colorado  homes,  which I had been assuming meant they were having things shipped  from the  East coast.  And, when we spent a couple of weeks at our LA  home  recently so I could get in some motorcycle riding and away from  the  snow, I found them on the shelves out there, too.  Somewhere along  the  way, they decided to become a national brand and have started   penetrating markets all over the place.  I have no idea what their   financials look like or any other solid DD besides knowing that they\'re   fucking delicious and, if you\'re a believer in the product, then   believing in the company shouldn\'t be hard.  So I bought a thousand   shares at 24.35 in solidarity with them.  Then I saw Cramer hyped them a   couple of nights ago and cursed myself for starting to turn into a   shitty Boomer.  Maybe they become a big player in the snack food space   on their own, maybe a company like $PEP comes along and buys them out.    Regardless, if you like the product, go out and buy some equity, you  fat  fuck.

INTC won't stay behind forever as nm tech progression isn't linear, it becomes harder and harder to progress to the next nm phase, and INTC owning its own supply chain is a significant industry advantage.\nAlthough AMD and NVDA is currently ahead in the nm processes, they do not own their own proprietary chips or processes, while INTC does. This puts INTC at a huge strategic advantage to boost up the US supply chain for chip supply, in the future for both CPU AND GPU. NOT just CPU. If INTC becomes fairly valued at industry PE ratios of their competitors of even just AMD, then fair value INTC stock price should hit near $200 per share levels.

People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn‚Äôt have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn‚Äôt have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.\n2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.\n3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.\n4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&amp;P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)\n   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.\n   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.\n      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.\n5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).\n6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.\n7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.\n   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income.\n8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nUsing my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:\n\nThis is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.\n\nThus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.\n\n^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)\n\nRisk of my predictions being completely off the mark.\n\n* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.\n* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon.

You‚Äôve heard about the GME volatility and *YOU WANT IN*! Fine, that‚Äôs great, welcome to the party. But there are some **VERY** important things to keep in mind as you‚Äôre learning how to trade with this crazy high volatility.\n\n\nLesson 1: *The Market*\n\nKeep in mind as you‚Äôre trading, that volatility like this is not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. At least it wasn‚Äôt before Covid, and it likely won‚Äôt be after. This can be a good or bad thing. Good if you can make some money, bad because you can lose a lot more money in a much shorter period of time. For a little more info, here‚Äôs a link to another post I made [explaining market halts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls8xjy/some_basic_stock_info_for_you_new_degenerates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)‚ÄúBut wait‚Äù, you say, ‚ÄúI want to make **MORE** money even **FASTER**! These 10% rises in shares just isn‚Äôt enough!‚Äù. Great! Yes, there are other *options* available for you to do that, but remember, that comes with greater risk. \n\n\nLesson 2: *Options* \n\nSo you‚Äôve heard of options now have you. Okay, that‚Äôs fine. But **BE CAREFUL**! Options carry a LOT of risk with them. Instead of losing ~10% of your investment when your shares decrease 10%, if you have a contract for a stock to hit a certain price (the *strike price*) by a certain point, you could either make or lose multiple times the % change of the stock movement.\n\nSo, say you have a call contract (you think the price will go up) for, let‚Äôs say GME to hit $200 by March 5th. That contract is worth roughly $1.25/ share, meaning it would cost $125 as each contract is multiplied by 100 shares. Now let‚Äôs say on Monday, GME hits the price of $205/ share. Congratulations! Your contract is ITM (in the money). \n\nNow you have 3 options. You can sell the contract for that new premium price, which is likely massive and you‚Äôre looking at likely over 3,000% gains on your investment. You can hold the contract and hope it goes up more before Friday, OR you can now exercise the contract, meaning if you have the funds, you can buy 100 shares of GME at your $200 strike price, despite the current price being $205. \n\nOkay now let‚Äôs say you buy the same contract, but the price falls from the current price of ~$100, down to $60. Instead of losing the 40% from the stock going down, you‚Äôre now looking at a loss of probably nearing 80 or 90%, with very little chance of it going up to $200 in the remaining time you have left for your contract. \n\nThis is where you have a couple options. You can sell, and take your losses. You can sell, and roll your contracts out to a further expiration date, OR you can hold that contract on the off chance you could make some of that money back by expiration, though by then you could have lost 100% of your investment.\n\n\nNow here are some general guidelines when trading options:\n\n**1.** *Take your gains*. Especially if you‚Äôre looking at 1,000%+ gains, this rarely happens and is quite an impressive return. You never lose when you take profits. If you‚Äôre experienced, and know the price could go up even more, make your own choice with what risk is acceptable to you.\n\n**2.** **STAY AWAY FROM FD‚Äôs** (weekly options contracts)! The Greeks on these are just too high for any new folks to make decent money on. (Theta decay is NOT your friend)\n\n**3.** Roll your contracts out a few weeks, and look at leaps as a potential play as well. Leaps allow you to hold a contract for up to a couple years, giving you ample time to make some money, or recover losses from a dip.\n\n**4.** Do your own DD (Due Diligence). You will read a lot of shit on this sub. Before you make a choice on what to buy, do your own research.\n\n**5.** The real DD is always in the comments. Think of DD as someone trying to sell you something, often times, the folks in the comments have nothing to gain from telling the truth, so you‚Äôll read different perspectives in the comments about a stock.\n\nI know this is a lot to read, but it‚Äôs important, especially for all you new folks. But here‚Äôs a TL,DR for all you smooth brains.\n\n**TL,DR: don‚Äôt trade weeklies unless you know what you‚Äôre doing, Don‚Äôt FOMO your portfolio when you‚Äôre worried about being left out of a run up, and take your profits to reinvest, or simply to have.**\n\nPositions: 3/5 GME $80c, 50 shares at $47, some Tesla and SPY calls.'), ('$FUBO - Sports Streaming + Sports Betting All in One App', '$FUBO - Sports Streaming + Sports Betting All in One App$FUBO is a sports based streaming service that\'s now rolling out their own sportsbook.\n\nStream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.\n\nER is coming Tuesday of next week.

INTC won't stay behind forever as nm tech progression isn't linear, it becomes harder and harder to progress to the next nm phase, and INTC owning its own supply chain is a significant industry advantage.\nAlthough AMD and NVDA is currently ahead in the nm processes, they do not own their own proprietary chips or processes, while INTC does. This puts INTC at a huge strategic advantage to boost up the US supply chain for chip supply, in the future for both CPU AND GPU. NOT just CPU.

People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn‚Äôt have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn‚Äôt have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.\n2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.\n3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.\n4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&amp;P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)\n   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.\n   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.\n      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.\n5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).\n6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.\n7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.\n   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income.\n8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nUsing my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:\n\nThis is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.\n\nThus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.\n\n^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)\n\nRisk of my predictions being completely off the mark.\n\n* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.\n* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.\n* Black swan events.\n* Think of something yourself man!

Ill quote the article from above: " If GEX is negative, MMs have to buy that amount of stock into rising prices and sell that amount of stock into falling prices. So, in short, negative GEX numbers create volatility while positive GEX numbers inhibit volatility. " Remember when I said this is the second-lowest GEX EVER?

You‚Äôve heard about the GME volatility and *YOU WANT IN*! Fine, that‚Äôs great, welcome to the party. But there are some **VERY** important things to keep in mind as you‚Äôre learning how to trade with this crazy high volatility.\n\n\nLesson 1: *The Market*\n\nKeep in mind as you‚Äôre trading, that volatility like this is not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. At least it wasn‚Äôt before Covid, and it likely won‚Äôt be after. This can be a good or bad thing. Good if you can make some money, bad because you can lose a lot more money in a much shorter period of time. For a little more info, here‚Äôs a link to another post I made [explaining market halts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls8xjy/some_basic_stock_info_for_you_new_degenerates/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)‚ÄúBut wait‚Äù, you say, ‚ÄúI want to make **MORE** money even **FASTER**! These 10% rises in shares just isn‚Äôt enough!‚Äù. Great! Yes, there are other *options* available for you to do that, but remember, that comes with greater risk. \n\n\nLesson 2: *Options* \n\nSo you‚Äôve heard of options now have you. Okay, that‚Äôs fine. But **BE CAREFUL**! Options carry a LOT of risk with them. Instead of losing ~10% of your investment when your shares decrease 10%, if you have a contract for a stock to hit a certain price (the *strike price*) by a certain point, you could either make or lose multiple times the % change of the stock movement.\n\nSo, say you have a call contract (you think the price will go up) for, let‚Äôs say GME to hit $200 by March 5th. That contract is worth roughly $1.25/ share, meaning it would cost $125 as each contract is multiplied by 100 shares. Now let‚Äôs say on Monday, GME hits the price of $205/ share. Congratulations! Your contract is ITM (in the money). \n\nNow you have 3 options. You can sell the contract for that new premium price, which is likely massive and you‚Äôre looking at likely over 3,000% gains on your investment. You can hold the contract and hope it goes up more before Friday, OR you can now exercise the contract, meaning if you have the funds, you can buy 100 shares of GME at your $200 strike price, despite the current price being $205. \n\nOkay now let‚Äôs say you buy the same contract, but the price falls from the current price of ~$100, down to $60. Instead of losing the 40% from the stock going down, you‚Äôre now looking at a loss of probably nearing 80 or 90%, with very little chance of it going up to $200 in the remaining time you have left for your contract. \n\nThis is where you have a couple options. You can sell, and take your losses. You can sell, and roll your contracts out to a further expiration date, OR you can hold that contract on the off chance you could make some of that money back by expiration, though by then you could have lost 100% of your investment.\n\n\nNow here are some general guidelines when trading options:\n\n**1.** *Take your gains*. Especially if you‚Äôre looking at 1,000%+ gains, this rarely happens and is quite an impressive return. You never lose when you take profits. If you‚Äôre experienced, and know the price could go up even more, make your own choice with what risk is acceptable to you.\n\n**2.** **STAY AWAY FROM FD‚Äôs** (weekly options contracts)! The Greeks on these are just too high for any new folks to make decent money on. (Theta decay is NOT your friend)\n\n**3.** Roll your contracts out a few weeks, and look at leaps as a potential play as well. Leaps allow you to hold a contract for up to a couple years, giving you ample time to make some money, or recover losses from a dip.\n\n**4.** Do your own DD (Due Diligence). You will read a lot of shit on this sub. Before you make a choice on what to buy, do your own research.\n\n**5.** The real DD is always in the comments. Think of DD as someone trying to sell you something, often times, the folks in the comments have nothing to gain from telling the truth, so you‚Äôll read different perspectives in the comments about a stock.\n\nI know this is a lot to read, but it‚Äôs important, especially for all you new folks. But here‚Äôs a TL,DR for all you smooth brains.\n\n**TL,DR: don‚Äôt trade weeklies unless you know what you‚Äôre doing, Don‚Äôt FOMO your portfolio when you‚Äôre worried about being left out of a run up, and take your profits to reinvest, or simply to have.**\n\nPositions: 3/5 GME $80c, 50 shares at $47, some Tesla and SPY calls.'), ('TL;DR Just some thinking about GME - Shitpost', "TL;DR Just some thinking about GME - ShitpostIf every member of WSB held just 5 shares each WSB would own the entire float of GME.

I‚Äôve never seen that before.  I‚Äôve owned AAPL for the last six years and I have never (and I mean NEVER) seen the stock drop $2-$3 consecutively for this long.

INTC won't stay behind forever as nm tech progression isn't linear, it becomes harder and harder to progress to the next nm phase, and INTC owning its own supply chain is a significant industry advantage.\nAlthough AMD and NVDA is currently ahead in the nm processes, they do not own their own proprietary chips or processes, while INTC does. This puts INTC at a huge strategic advantage to boost up the US supply chain for chip supply, in the future for both CPU AND GPU. NOT just CPU. If INTC becomes fairly valued at industry PE ratios of their competitors of even just AMD, then fair value INTC stock price should hit near $200 per share levels.

Suicidal strike, but I like the sentiment. \n\n****\n\nWhen the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I\'m in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I\'ve had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I\'m happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week\'s DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I\'ll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.\n\n**Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we\'re playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don\'t get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can‚Äôt afford it, don‚Äôt play it.** There are opportunities every day. \n\nAnyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let\'s roll.\n\n****\n\n**1.\tThe SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**\n\nOn Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an ‚Äúinvestor day‚Äù**.  Investor day was indeed the whale\'s bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.\n\nI hadn\'t heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.\n\nThen, the next interesting hits came.  Last week\'s Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I\'d made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**\n\nIt was time to get to work.\n\n****\n\n**2.\tThe investigation**\n\nI wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven\'t paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.\n\n1) [SNAP](https://investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https://investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I\'d call it significant.\n\n2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.\n\n*All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump. \n\n*NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No "investor day" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*\n\nThese companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said "WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT".\n\n****\n\n**3.\tDefining RAMBO**\n\nAs I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**\n\nI also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https://esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present üò¨ üòâ.\n\n**Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I‚Äôll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**\n\n****\n\n**4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO** \n\n**What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you\'re going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**\n\n**My theory is that the current ER environment‚Äîwhere your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn\'t be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference. \n\n**5. So what am I saying?**\n\nI\'m saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies\' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.\n\n**Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I‚Äôll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**\n\n[EPD](https://i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ \n\nDipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let\'s be real--I couldn\'t care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.\n\nThe real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.\n\nYou know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I\'ll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.\n\nAs always pick a good entry point.\n\n[BIDU](https://i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ \n\n**EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn‚Äôt the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright \n\nYeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:\n\n&gt;BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) ("Baidu" or the "Company"), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the "EGM") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People\'s Republic of China.\nA proposal of changing the Company\'s authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares ("Share Subdivision") will be submitted to Baidu\'s shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.\n\nYes, that\'s right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company\'s split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain\'t ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.\n\n[CRM](https://i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) üöÄ üò¨ \n\nCRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they\'ve got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.

Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don\'t care how rich you are.\n\n**Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I‚Äôm a bandwagon hopper ü§∑üèø\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble\n\n****\n\n**TLDR**:\nCheck the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.\n\nI like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**.

That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.\n\nAs many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important. \n\nSo what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.\n\nThe reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.\n\nOver the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.\n\nAlso, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!\n\nThis is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.\n\nCalls were cheap on Friday so I bought 170 BRK.B $242.50C 3/5/21. $50K YOLO on the Oracle of Omaha."), ('SPY PUTS #2üåàüêª OG', 'SPY PUTS #2üåàüêª OG[deleted]')], '2021-03-01': [], '2021-03-02': [], '2021-03-03': [("Serious thing about $GME, you don't understand what's going on here...", 'Serious thing about $GME, you don\'t understand what\'s going on here...Guys, this rocket has been like the SpaceX Boosters, they get close to space but always touch back down to earth...

None that I could find on google.\n\nThen I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things\n\n**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**\n\nhttps://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html\n\nWell, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.\n\nhttps://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html\n\nHere's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nnd0trherk61.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=063271b9d3c38f3b13c8d7296a83c7e1171f5f18\n\nAs you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.\n\nSo I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9hpvqcjerk61.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3\n\nEach blue vertical line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards. Each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down. Typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds. This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztl2qhukerk61.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c4a01bd3fa1ea890684719df463cccf602b57a\n\nAs you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?\n\n**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**\n\nLooking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.\n\n&gt;This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.\n\nhttps://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html\n\nAnd looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people). I didn't do a screen capture as its a long scroll. But the data is on the link below. Just look at all the March earnings vs the one reported before it.\n\nhttps://www dot marketbeat dot com/stocks/NASDAQ/COST/earnings/\n\nThe most recent price target estimate I could easily google (ALL above where its trading now)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4obvitmerk61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5196871a95da03e36cea4ad3f807545f3397fb50\n\n**Fundamentals (if they matter anymore) have not changed, AND WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.**\n\n**They make a ton of money (selling tendies):**\n\n&gt;In FY 2020, ended August 30, 2020, Costco posted year-over-year (YOY) gains in revenue, net income, and other metrics. Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3\ufeff The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4\ufeff  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.\n\n**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**\n\nContinuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.\n\n**They are international (also making tendies):**\n\n&gt;Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.\n\nhttps://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774\n\n**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**\n\n&gt;Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.\n\nhttps://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx\n\nCostco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nI like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?) Calls. Ill have 60 shares come market open tomorrow.\n\nedit: fat fingered march 5th instead of march 4th earnings call.\n\nedit 2: i wrote horizontal line instead of vertical line when referencing the plotted earnings calls (too much writing!)."), ("I'm still buying your paper hands.

I\'m assuming you smooth brains have at least heard of the ***Dotcom bubble***. Maybe you\'re a baby and are more familiar with the ***Housing Bubble***. Well let me tell you something: next up is the ***Unicorn Extinction*** bubble!!\n\nI love Unicorns, so much so that it\'s my last name and also the name of my business (totally serious) but this inevitable crash is as much a "hypothesis" as evolution is. But the markets seem to love and worship these billion dollar tech unicorns more than I do.\n\n*So here\'s the breakdown for you retards. I even used crayons and highlighters, and I\'ll outline it from top to bottom and spell it out to make it really easy for you to understand. Get your kool-aid and prepare to learn something.*\n\nWhat you\'re looking at below is ***$SPY*** which represents the S-and-P 500. Ooh letters and numbers!\n\nYou know that thing with numbers that you see on the TV sometimes? No, not the channel with the big yellow bird. You see it on that station at the bank that Mommy takes you to sometimes. It\'s called "C-N-N" and it\'s like REALLY boring, but you sit and drool with a dum-dum in your mouth (because that\'s what you are) and listen to them say things like "The S and P is down 15 points today." It\'s a bunch of silly made up words, I know. But those numbers are the reason Mommy is crying and talking to Mr banker...\n\nHere, I\'ll illustrate it for you. I even used crayons and highlighters. We\'re going to look at the pretty picture from TOP to BOTTOM, okay?\n\nSo the lines underneath the actual stock price are moving averages (MA). They are the mean line of what a stock should be doing based upon its history. From warm colors (short term MA) to cool colors (long term MA) it\'s ***normal to see a bit of divergence***. However, the further apart these lines get, the more it\'s indicative of an ***over-valued market***, maybe so much so that it\'s going to be a free-fall as the bubble pops. The case I\'m making for this Unicorn Extinction (*yes, I\'m coining this term, and fucking some financial analyst better quote me when I\'m right*) is the result of ***hyper-inflation*** (fed printers go BRRR), ***ridiculous speculation***, and ***over-valued businesses*** (mostly tech) yet again.\n\nThese moving averages have the highest divergence they\'ve ever had!! That\'s not normal, and it means a price correction is coming, and it\'s going to be a fucking blood bath! The large green highlight is where the market SHOULD be, at least in my humble and moronic opinion.\n\nThe next box down is a Relative Strength Indicator (RSI). I won\'t get into the math, because 1+1=banana to you ü¶ç. Essentially "traders" (that\'s a big boy word) use this to know when a stock is over-bought or over-sold. Are you seeing a pattern on this screenshot?\n\nThe last box down, is harder to see, but this is your Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). It essentially a mean of other Moving Average lines to indicate when a stock is going to switch directions. I\'m zoomed out so far that you can\'t see all of the warnings, but I\'ve circled them for you. These were the major signs that a crash was coming in the past.   You\'ve been warned. Hope you are prepared for this next crash, and if you want to profit while others suffer (it\'s a bittersweet feeling) then you can do as I\'m doing and short $SPY.\n\nAlso, fuck your üíéüëã and üöÄ because I already played that game.

Once AMD is able to pick production back up, sales will go through the roof. There is so much demand for their product it is insane.

One company bought the other and both Goldstar and LG Semicon became what we now know as LG.\n\nBack in those days tracking the manufacturing of chips was crucial (no pun intended), because of the daily swing of the prices. The determining factors (which I looked at), were :\n\n* Production capacity of each factory.\n* Daily production numbers of computers.\n* Intel ($INTC), AMD, ($AMD), Microsoft ($MSFT), Compaq, HP ($HP - Hewlett Packard, at one time, "absorbed" Packard Bell Computers), and other mass consumers/assemblers of IC chips for PCBs (Printed Circuit Board), including details of motherboard designs and IC requirements.\n* Mother Nature and her wrath "overseas".\n\nThe computer makers, DELL ($DELL), Gateway, and Compaq always had first choice of available chips, due to their deep pockets and demand.\n\nA few companies in Asian countries figured out that by closing a factory, for a day or a week, they could, effectively, increase their profits quickly. This effected the entire "Technology Sector", although it did not exist yet.\n\n&gt;**Points:**\n\n* Always ask "Why".\n* "Due Diligence" is not just 2 levels deep.

I know, I know, I didn't think my first contribution would be about a Jim Cramer Boomer Stock... but yea, it really is. But just follow along with me here.\n\nI first began the day planning out my next moves for when I start jumping off the tech train (like right about now), and begin embracing the market for post pandemic retail/life (and once the CPI begins to bump, the moves for making money in the market during inflation). This led me to look at commodities and companies which deals with commodities.\n\n**ENTER COSTCO**\n\nI then pull up COST and wonder what the heck am I looking at. Why is there such a dip!?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs582ukeerk61.png?width=501&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd299c206740f45dbfec2923e2483ee9e4fd46cd\n\nThere must have been some terrible news right? Being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of 5, I begin researching what terrible thing happened to Costco to cause such a rapid selloff. But the more I looked the more I realized that this selloff is really just weird...and it could be an opportunity to get some tendies...(or rotisserie chickens...see what I did there?)\n\n**Researching Possible Causes**\n\nCould it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks? No, its only running 0.98% of shares shorted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6jtyoyferk61.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52d06efbe13966d7ee2d559e5a7c4fd0d7f6a106\n\nWas there any news of accidents or management issues? None that I could find on google.\n\nThen I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things\n\n**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**\n\nhttps://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html\n\nWell, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.\n\nhttps://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html\n\nHere's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nnd0trherk61.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=063271b9d3c38f3b13c8d7296a83c7e1171f5f18\n\nAs you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.\n\nSo I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9hpvqcjerk61.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3\n\nEach blue vertical line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards. Each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down. Typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds. This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztl2qhukerk61.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c4a01bd3fa1ea890684719df463cccf602b57a\n\nAs you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?\n\n**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**\n\nLooking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.\n\n&gt;This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.\n\nhttps://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html\n\nAnd looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people). I didn't do a screen capture as its a long scroll. But the data is on the link below. Just look at all the March earnings vs the one reported before it.\n\nhttps://www dot marketbeat dot com/stocks/NASDAQ/COST/earnings/\n\nThe most recent price target estimate I could easily google (ALL above where its trading now)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4obvitmerk61.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5196871a95da03e36cea4ad3f807545f3397fb50\n\n**Fundamentals (if they matter anymore) have not changed, AND WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.**\n\n**They make a ton of money (selling tendies):**\n\n&gt;In FY 2020, ended August 30, 2020, Costco posted year-over-year (YOY) gains in revenue, net income, and other metrics. Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3\ufeff The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4\ufeff  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.\n\n**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**\n\nContinuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.\n\n**They are international (also making tendies):**\n\n&gt;Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.\n\nhttps://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774\n\n**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**\n\n&gt;Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.\n\nhttps://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx\n\nCostco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nI like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?)

Being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of 5, I begin researching what terrible thing happened to Costco to cause such a rapid selloff. But the more I looked the more I realized that this selloff is really just weird...and it could be an opportunity to get some tendies...(or rotisserie chickens...see what I did there?)\n\n**Researching Possible Causes**\n\nCould it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks?

None that I could find on google.\n\nThen I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things\n\n**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**\n\nhttps://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html\n\nWell, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.\n\nhttps://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html\n\nHere's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nnd0trherk61.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=063271b9d3c38f3b13c8d7296a83c7e1171f5f18\n\nAs you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.\n\nSo I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k9hpvqcjerk61.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3\n\nEach blue vertical line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards.

This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztl2qhukerk61.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c4a01bd3fa1ea890684719df463cccf602b57a\n\nAs you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?\n\n**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**\n\nLooking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.\n\n&gt;This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.\n\nhttps://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html\n\nAnd looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people).

Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3\ufeff The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4\ufeff  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.\n\n**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**\n\nContinuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.\n\n**They are international (also making tendies):**\n\n&gt;Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.\n\nhttps://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774\n\n**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**\n\n&gt;Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.\n\nhttps://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx\n\nCostco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nI like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?)

Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.\n\n**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**\n\nContinuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.\n\n**They are international (also making tendies):**\n\n&gt;Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.\n\nhttps://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774\n\n**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**\n\n&gt;Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.\n\nhttps://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx\n\nCostco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\nI like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?)

WFC is a bank that was in the doghouse. Fed says it can come out and play now.  \n2.) WFC is a bank and banks do well in high interest rate environments. Rates are skyrocketing right now.\n\n3.)

I feel this is an over reaction because the 10-yr bond yields are just at where they were pre-covid. I outline below why there won't be any rise in the short term interest rates atleast till the end of 2023 and why stonks will go up\n\n**Unemployment claims and inflation** \n\nUnemployement rate in January was 6.3% and the Fed's natural rate of unemployement stands at around 4%. The Fed has cited that if we were to include millions of people who quit the labor force and other misclassifactions the rate could go up to 10%. So, even though we are reopening there is a very high rate of unemployement across the country.\n\nIn Feb 2020, US had the lowest unemployement in it's history at 3.5% and guess what the inflation number was ? less than 2%.\n\n**Effect of stimmy and infrastructure package**\n\nThere is around $1.9 trillion stimulus package on the way and plan for a $2 trillion infrastructure package later. If both of them were to get through (I doubt the infrastrucure deal), the expectation is that in the extreme case we might reach the 3.2% unmployement rate (which is good) sooner (early 2022) than later. With industries moving to automation on a large scale, lower unemployement rates are hard to sustain.\n\n*But with the reopening, there might be a spike in inflation but that will quickly subside due to the forces of globalization, opening up supply chains, cheap labor and goods. This is a case for lower unemployement and lower inflation.*\n\n**How will we pay back the Federal Debt ??? The Inflation elixir**\n\nWe don't need to worry about higher debt, we only need to look at the level of public debt relative to GDP, because the costs of any debt level are less important when the economy is larger. The economy can be made larger in two ways\n\n1. Increase in real production\n2. Increase in the prices of the produced goods\n\nBeing a developed economy there is only so much the US can increase real GDP. The elixir of inflation will solve the problem for us. Here is a simple example\n\n***Assume that inflation returns to Fed's target of 2% per year and the GDP growth rate is 1.5%, then the nominal growth rate would be 3.5%.***   \nGuess, how much uncle sam pays for borrowing ???   \n0.7 percent per year on its 10-year borrowing and 0.1 percent per year on its 3-month borrowing through 2021. At the end of 2019, 1.55 percent and 1.92 percent\xa0\n\n***Even without a primary budget surplus, the net effect of interest payments and growth would be to shrink the debt-GDP ratio at a rate of 2.0 (=\xa0 3.5 ‚Äì 1.5) percent per year, when inflation rate is at 2%. Assume the reduction in debt when inflation rises to 3% or 4%. This reduction would increase to 3% and 4% per year which is huge.***\n\nThe same has happened after world war II when debt to GDP ratio is at current levels and it got diluted over the years because of inflation and the only way we will be able achieve is through lower rates, which is good for stonks overall. I believe the Fed will opt for a higher inflation target around 3%-4% before finally moving to increase any short term rates.\n\n**Tl;DR**\n\nOver-valued tech stocks might be taking a beating but the marker overall is poised to move up. Whether we see inflation or not, interest rates are going to be low atleast for the next three years if not more, else uncle sam can't pay his debt back. \n\nPositions : Long SPY"), ('Recent dips in semi-conductors an opening?', 'Recent dips in semi-conductors an opening?AMD has taken a hit past few weeks but I think it‚Äôs reached pretty attractive levels to start a position.

Target a strike price (15-30 days expiration) which is OTM by 10-15%. (not more than that) if that strike price is currently at 1.50, make a limit buy at $0.80-$0.90 (always 40-50% less ) if there's an extreme market selloff your limit can get in. Remember to see at your targeted profit level. Let' say 50-100% depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nRemember when the market oversells, new money flows in for opportunity, as within 2/3 days the market will stabilize. if you buy an option at that time, you might risk hitting loss.

It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I\'d worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like "Stimulus Checks set to arrive..."\n\nBut *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including‚Äîbut not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do‚Äîif the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.\n\n**This one couldn‚Äôt come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. \n\n**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They\'re betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn\'t help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). \n\n**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn\'t pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week‚Äôs losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn‚Äôt I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I\'m not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you\'ll make some money at some point if you don\'t hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. \n\n**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low‚Äîthere is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people‚Äôs accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I\'d rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don\'t come back burning me.\n\nBut anyway, **you didn‚Äôt come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let\'s talk whales.\n\n***\n\n**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They‚Äôre great!**\n\n**Last week‚Äôs lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.\n\n**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it\'s sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y\'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though üòÖ \n\n**Last week‚Äôs lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you\'s a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don\'t know man, I think so), and couldn\'t hold.  I **think the key here is it‚Äôs okay to take a pause on the pick if it‚Äôs hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**\n\n**‚ÄùNever lost, just ran out of time‚Äù**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD\'s ago is puh-rinting.  Should\'ve held I guess.

But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn\'t as big a deal as people were intimating. \n\nSometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that\'s what I\'m watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don\'t, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones\' Locker (I\'m so corny bruh üò≠ ).\n\n[Somebody did a solid DD write-up on NOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/) pre-event at r/investing.

If you guys read my DD on NIO before the NIO Day Catalyst, you would\'ve bought in at 38 and sold around 60 (I sold calls, but still holding my shares).\n\nNow, there are two new catalysts that are arguably even greater than the announcements at Nio Day. \n\n**1) Energy**  \nOn Nio Day, William Li announced a second-generation Battery Swap station, where users don\'t even have to leave their cars. The stations are also a lot cheaper to operate, with greater capacity. They can complete about 312 battery swaps per day. \n\nImagine a world where Battery Stations replace Gas stations. What would that say about Nio? And what would happen to gas stations?\n\nWell early February, William Li met with Sinopec\'s CEO. Sinopec is one of the largest oil and chemicals companies in the world (2nd globally according to Forbes). They have over 30,000 gas stations. Here\'s the kicker: There are not so subtle rumors that Sinopec gas station will incorporate Nio Battery Swap Stations. Nio plans to have 500 battery swap stations by the end 2021, some of which may be at Sinopec\'s stations. The growth in revenue will accelerate.   \n   \n**Imagine if NIO\'s main source of revenue was from selling energy, rather than just cars.**\n\nIt\'ll send Nio\'s share price to the moon.  \n\n\n**2) Hong Kong Stock Exchange**  \nNio plans to list in the Hong Kong stock exchange around April. XPEV and LI will also be added. This is great news for Nio\'s stock price. An announcement about BABA listing on the HK stock exchange (around November 2019) led to its share price rising from 185 to 300 in three months.\n\nThe same will happen to Nio, and even more so, because Li and Xpev\'s rise will bring Nio up even more due to their coupling in various EV-related ETF\'s. \n\nWatch out for an announcement in April.   \n\n\n4**) Other thoughts**  \nI\'ve noticed, increasingly, that puts bought for the purpose of hedging positions are now mostly be applied to index ETF\'s like SPY and QQQ. Why? Because GME\'s short squeeze drama nearly killed several hedge funds. Sentiment Analysis has become a household name, and all the major hedge funds track WallStreetBets to avoid stocks that are too popular. Nio is one of those stocks that boomer hf\'s realize is one of the popular ones on "reddit". Google "top reddit stocks" and you\'ll see Nio routinely mentioned (this is also why I think stocks like PLTR will no longer suffer for too long). \n\nAlso Mizuho announced a Nio PT at $60, and Deutsche Bank recently released a memo stating that Nio can reach $70 in the near term. These things tell me that both retail and hedge funds are united in loving NIO stonk. We might be clear for another takeoff.   \n\n\n**3) What to Do**  \nThe dates on these catalysts are not announced like Nio Day was. All I know is that it\'ll happen sometime in the next few months. To play it safe, I would buy call leaps. My price target is 70-80 by EOY. Also, load up on shares on dips and sell covered calls each time we reach new highs. I plan to diamond hand Nio, as believe it\'ll reach higher than $300 in five years. I\'ll be buying/selling calls, but not sell my shares.   \n\n\n**4) Community Boost**  \nIf NIO passes $70 per share by eod, April 16, I\'ll donate to charity and post as an update. I don\'t want to virtue signal, but I hope it encourages some people on here to think about their community. I was inspired to do this by other WSBers that donated to the Food Bank with some of their GME earnings, so for that, thank you, and I hope I too can pass on the kindness.   \n\n\n**TLDR** \\- NIO is likely to partner with the world\'s second largest Oil Company this year and have their newly designed battery swap stations operate in gas stations, thus Nio might actually make more money as an energy provider than a car company. Also, Nio will be listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has helped stocks like BABA go to the moon in the past. \n\n**TLDR** \\- I\'ll donate to charity if NIO‚Äôs passes $70 per share by April 16.'), ("Not an Ape Meme so unlikely to trend (though, ape never kill ape, remember that.).

Instead a simple message for the big institutions and brokerages and my fellow WSB autists. **** everything that\'s been happening in the market, the manipulation has gotten pathetic.So, lets keep it short.  While I was surprised and pretty sure RH\'s move to block GME buys was calculated, I also wasn\'t surprised when they eased back to allow some trading.  Realistically,  being responsible for the collective trades on RH of all places has got to be fairly high risk.\n\nWait, what? Shutup you ninny.    Sorry I talk to myself at times.  F their risk, how is it that the financial professionals are always completely incompetent with risk management and get screwed on a regular basis til the SEC, etc., bails them out.  \n\nI\'m no political activist, but I have and will continue to write to anyone from the president to my local state house reps.  Not only is the manipulation blatant, given Melv\'s stake in RH and the consequential severe conflict of interests went their "clients" want something to go up but the "real client" very much doesnt want that.  The fact that you can have 150% of outstanding shares shorted is absurdity and shouldnt even be legal.  But, rule 1 in trading is adapt or die, right?\n\nWell gee, I thought I had a good idea - I noticed i could get about the same money on 6-mont $800 GME call sales ($94.00 iirc, still as close as a month but that\'s playing with fire with naked options.)\n\nOh, and I\'ve had and have had naked permissions, I rarely use them, more to leg out of a trade if anything, but with 6 months for GME to correct that seems like a no-brainer sell, and if it  stays at  2000  for a year, rip my yolo.       Well, apparently TD/Think or Swim isn\'t allowing naked options permissions, and wouldn\'t even let me sell a covered call as I hadn\'t talked to one of their "experts" about the trade.   It\'s funny cuz, I can buy 200,000 TSLA $5k calls for whatever small amount that\'d be, and TD would be just fine with that.    This anti-risk narrative is sickening.  I also can\'t sell spreads? DEFINED risk trades?  \n\n\nAm I the only one who feels like its all our war on retail traders? To be fair, plenty are dumb FOMO buyers but they\'ll be gone soon and those that have been around know the deal.  We\'ve long dealt with all the bullshit that funds and institutions force upon us.  I have a high 7-figure BoA account but they insist on charging me 27% APR on my card.   It\'s highway robbery left and right.  \n\n\nI see two main options : if there is a good broker that will allow all this, EVERYONE switch and bankrupt all the other fuckers.   Fidelity sounded promising and   I have a history with them and  should prob get top permissions immediately, but who knows if they\'ll take the trade.  I sure as hell dont want to call them, wait  20 min while it moves  30% etc., just to put in an order - and THEY KNOW THIS OF COURSE.    They\'ve found the magic cure for their retail trader woes - when they\'re front running you regardless of your brokerage and  able to  scalp your trade, they make money off that as well as plenty, I\'m sure, when  it drops from 500 to 200, etc..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n"Free market".  "Fair market".   Load of horse manure.  Retail traders can get busted for overhearing news at a party and acting on it, yet these fux literally choose the market movement.\n\nOption B: What would hurt them more than  GME? Maybe tank RH or TD\'s stock.   I\'m tired of writing and I said I\'d be brief (i lied), but they\'ve declared war.  The richer will truly keep gettin richer while the poorer get poorer as the labor market evaporates if retail traders can\'t survive based on merit.  I\'m open to ideas.  I\'m sick of being told its for my protection that I cant sell calls, at times, higher than the strike (ie, 300 call i\'ve seen go for 320.  Pure retardation of course, but why cant I eat too?  \n\n\nI wonder if it\'s possible to make a community brokerage thats kinda like RH in terms of accessibility, but not bullshit corruption and terribadness.  \n\n\nIdk.  that was low was low effort  but this ish has me depressed for our future.

Hear me out. (I\'m not a short-seller)', 'Why short-sellers aren\'t inherently "greedy". Hear me out. (I\'m not a short-seller)Hopefully this doesn\'t get me banned. I\'m not out to get anybody here, just trying to offer an alternative perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCredentials:\n\nI\'m a professional analyst. My undergrad is in Economics from Ole Miss. I have an MBA from Southern Methodist University.  I\'m about to begin the CFA exam/study process. I started as a credit analyst for commercial banks, I worked briefly as a loan officer (I\'m an awful salesman!), I\'ve worked in portfolio credit risk management, and as a corporate financial analyst. I\'ve analyzed the financial statements of thousands of companies. At work, I\'m known as the guy who\'s not afraid to offer my view, regardless who might disagree. I\'ve been the nail that stuck out and gotten hammered before. But for the most part, I\'ve found my honesty to be deeply appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContext:\n\nI pick value-stocks. I\'m not a short-seller. For one thing, I don\'t have that kind of capital; and two, short-selling is HARD. REALLY HARD. I\'ve talked with short-sellers who\'ve been in that game for 30+ years. A wise one told me he was "right" about the direction about 80% of the time, but only gets the timing right about half the time.\n\nI\'m not here to talk down to anyone. I\'m not here to convince you what you should or shouldn\'t do with your money. And I\'m not here to convince you to "like" hedge funds or anything of the sort. I\'m here to try to convey what I believe to be true.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArgument:\n\nThe way I see it, most short-sellers aren\'t "greedy" just because they bet against companies. Think about this. Short-selling has finite/limited up-side risks, and (theoretically) infinite/unlimited down-side risks. Stock prices can only fall closer and closer to zero, but as this sub has shown several times, there is no limit to the upper-bound of an equity-share price.\n\nIf I were incredibly greedy, why would I want to take that kind of bet? A rational greedy investor would only buy stocks because as the mantra here goes, stock prices have unlimited potential to move upwards "to the MOON!".\n\nIn my financial statement analysis classes, perhaps my smartest professor advised "Short-sellers are ARBITERS OF TRUTH in the market-place. If you\'re analyzing a stock and you think you like it a lot, but it\'s heavily shorted, you NEED TO KEEP DIGGING, until you understand why it\'s being shorted. Short-sellers have to be the best analysts of them all. You need to be supremely confident in your analysis, and too, the timing (which is 100x harder to get right). The question for those going long on heavily shorted stocks should be "What are the short investors telling us about this security?".\n\nSee Michael J.

For those still debating the AMC-sale happening in April vs. June: You\'re both kind of right. They filed the shelf offering back in April which was advising their INTENT to sell additional shares in the future. They didn\'t act on that till today, which IS new. So, we\'ve been capable of being aware of the fact they will sell additional shares in the future since April, but it didn\'t actually occur till today.'), ('Tesla Model S Plaid + major delays.', 'Tesla Model S Plaid + major delays.I just got a phone call from a Tesla representative over their new vehicle deliveries.

He DID NOT say it was a chip shortage issue. Edit:  Delayed deliveries from 2021 to mid year 2022.  1 year delay.  \n\nThis leads me to believe the following. \n1.

Once that acquisition is approved by world regulators, arbitrage will stop and the stock will soar. Note that the acquisition doesn't have to close, it just needs to be approved for the Arbitrage to stop. Once Arbitrage stops, all of the short selling which is holding AMD stock down will stop, and AMD will rocket towards it's price targets between $106-135\n\n**Arbitrage effect on stocks**  \n In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the price difference. The short selling pushes the price of AMD down, continually, until the arbitrage stops. \n\nRead more on AMD Merger Arbitrage here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd\\_an\\_explanation\\_on\\_merger\\_arbitrage\\_and\\_how\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/)\n\nArbitrage will end when the share ratio between XLNX stock and AMD stock is equal, where there's no difference to be gained. Right now the share ratio difference is \\~1.57 or about 10%. The 10% difference is there for the chance that the acquisition does not go through. Once world regulators approve it though, the chance of acquisition is basically 100% and the share ratio difference will be 0. With no difference, the arbitrage trading and short selling stops and the stock rises.

There is no other type of DD, just short squeeze DD.\n\nDD actually does not mean due diligence, it‚Äôs actually an Akkadian term that Hammurabi came up with in ancient Babylon when he minted the first stock certificate in 1760 BC on a stone tablet, and his younger sister Iltani then tried to borrow it and sell it, and then he asked her to return it immediately, and she had to pay more than she sold it for to get it back. In other words, DD means short squeeze and short squeeze means DD.\n\nBut I‚Äôm now way off topic.\n\n**It is of course simple to do a short squeeze, and SPY is the thing that is not yet squoze.**\n\nFirst you find a thing people know, so it has meme potential and you don‚Äôt have to build brand recognition. This is actually more important than if anyone has shorted it.\n\nThen you declare a ‚Äòshort squeeze‚Äô is possible. Again, it doesn't matter how much it's been shorted.\n\nLastly‚Ä¶ You ‚Äòshort squeeze‚Äô (*By buying tons of call options, which is actually a delta squeeze and then a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze SHHHHH*).\n\nWhy do I bring this up? I‚Äôm glad you asked. It's like I said, it's time to short squeeze SPY.\n\nYou may be thinking‚Ä¶ what could be more idiotic? Is there a faster way to lose money? The answers are of course ‚Äònothing‚Äô and ‚Äòno‚Äô.\n\n**But those thoughts don‚Äôt serve up confirmatory bias. So instead, here‚Äôs a list of things that may help you with confirmatory bias:**\n\n1. Tendies\n2. It‚Äôs actually the SPDR, or Spider, S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust. Spiders are vicious ambush predators, the type that would trap and feast upon the tendies of a hedge fund manager if they could.\n3. Citadel Securities, Melvin Capital, and ‚ÄúThe Hedge Funds‚Äù have surely shorted this at some point, and I hear they aren‚Äôt so popular around here.\n4. The short interest is 16%. That may not sound like a lot, but if 21% was good enough for AMC, surely 16% is close enough. More importantly, that is 362 BILLION DOLLARS of shares short. Even at its highest points, GME had something like 15 or 20 billion dollars short and the shorts had no choice but to cover. Even Stevie Cohen and Citadel can‚Äôt bail a bunch of hedge funds out of 362 billion dollars in an epic short squeeze of SPY! It would take a fed intervention, and they never do stuff like that.\n\nBut it gets even better! S&amp;P 500 futures trade in arbitrage (fancy word for ‚Äòsame way) against SPY, and there are currently bout 2.8 million of those outstanding. Each one is $210k, so this is another $588 billion dollars of exposure‚Ä¶ and because each one technically has a long end and a short counterparty, it is in a way 100% short. Wow!\n\nOf course, none of this would be any good with a visual aid, since a lot of people here can‚Äôt read. Here‚Äôs a graph from the latest SpotGamma newsletter that shows the positioning of gamma vs SPY and SPX prices. They sadly don‚Äôt have ES. This suggests that squeezing up will be resisted by options at first and that squeezing SPY is unlikely to work, but don‚Äôt worry, the hedge funds would never see it coming if that call interest above suddenly became long calls!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/az9tllkyji471.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d85ed56f73dfc6da5786269195f63e561e15d68\n\nHistory is on our side too.

The hedgies will play dirty and do what is called a ‚Äòshort ladder‚Äô attack. This consists of them going to home depot, buying a foot ladder, and swinging it in a low motion at your shins. It also makes your stock prices go down. I recommend buying cowboy boots to defend against this.\n2. The hedgies also can do 'naked shorting'. This is when they take off their clothes and dump ES futures, which just require a counterparty on the other end, and don't require you have the stock to sell, just that you post collateral.\n3.

That's still a sweet opportunity.", 'Buy $BB Recommendations by David Gardner (Stock Advisor - A Motley Fool Service) July 19, 2018!!! That\'s still a sweet opportunity.Hey Ya! Remember the early 2000s? It was all about lace-up jeans, giant cargo shorts, Gilmore Girls, Lord of the Rings, the Atkins Diet ... and the BlackBerry.\n\nLong before the iPhone, the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe, known especially for its reliability, its security, and its full keyboard. But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn\'t change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention ‚Äî first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.\n\nAnd that\'s where we see a major opportunity.\n\nBlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You\'ve heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle "the Enterprise of Things." BlackBerry\'s new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn\'t fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it\'s securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.\n\nIf your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.\n\nSecond Bloom!\n\nIt\'s no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 ‚Äî and even then, the company\'s share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.\n\nBut this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company\'s progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren\'t part of management\'s vision or our investment thesis going forward.\n\nBlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.\n\nBut the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company\'s fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.\n\nThe company\'s QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.\n\nThis certainly isn\'t the only area where BlackBerry\'s business is growing, but it\'s emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner\'s (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that\'s expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021. \n\nStill Green!\n\nThat hasn\'t yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it\'s building the core of a very profitable business.\n\nSince being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company\'s shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).\n\nAdd it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.\n\nRisks and When We\'d Sell!\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry\'s financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry\'s relatively high sales, marketing, and R&amp;D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.\n\nThe company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors ‚Äî companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others ‚Äî have a lot of resources. That\'s why it\'s important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.\n\nThe Foolish Bottom Line!\n\nNot every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is "largely done reinventing itself" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know ‚Äî he\'s a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.\n\nWhether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected "things" safe and secure.

Unfortunately my timing couldn\'t be worse.  A month after I sold, the stock skyrocketed to $85.  Later, it then rose to $135 a month or two later.  It was no longer the deal it has once been, and I never felt that it was worth chasing.  Biggest mistake of my investing career.  I point this out because you just never know when things will explode, but if you know the company well enough you can determine that it\'s an inevitability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRocket Companies (RKT) used to be known as Quicken Loans, which was established in 1985.  When the company decided to go digital, they changed their name to Rocket Companies.  Rocket Companies has only been around since 2016.  Quicken Loans grew at a 25% compound annualized growth rate (CAGR), and before the company went public, Rocket Companies had a 16% CAGR between 2016 and 2020.  With a 16% CAGR, the company doubles in size every 5 years just for reference.  Below is the S-1 document showing their CAGR before they became public in 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004008/a2241988zs-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004008/a2241988zs-1.htm)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince Becoming public, RKT has had some impressive growth indeed.   Income grew 526%, and revenue grew 187%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2k8f3xhrik471.png?width=2248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62d09fbb033af6fde28719273cc9ea2da7580c35\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntvln76sik471.png?width=2252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c99d8deea18a00861a434042ec3f0bb06e09188\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter reporting the 2020 year results, the stock skyrocketed of course.  This only lasted a few days before it came back down settled right back to where the stock came from.  The stock was roughly $20 or so before the results, and after it rose somewhere near $45 from a pump and dump situation.  The price then fell for about 2-3 straight months back down to where it came from.  The primary reason for the price dropping from something that was closer to a realistic price target back down to the low 20s was the belief that interest rates were going to rise in 2021-2023 due to inflation.  That was going to kill home buying, and this was "as good as it gets"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE WAR WITH UWMC:**\n\nTo add to the industry problems, UWMC started a war with RKT.  This war was started because RKT was taking market share in every direction.  UWMC is a great company, but it\'s a distant second in overall lending origination as you can see in this list below of the top lending companies for 2020.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iukjdhnvik471.png?width=448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de37da1ec33a9f1f36d59507836c47e99139ab87\n\nBy the end of 2020, Rocket Companies had 8.9% of the entire housing loan origination market in the US.  They continued to grow that market share in the latest reported quarter to somewhere in the mid 9% range.   In the beginning of March, UWMC issued an ultimatum that all realtors who use UWMC are not allowed to use RKT anymore.  That means one month (March) in Q1 would be affected by this new ultimatum.  Both UWMC and RKT declared victory within the first week of March.  We would have to wait for Q1 earning to come out to see who really was winning the war.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQ1 earnings came out, and here are the results:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3bsmsvzik471.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d53584a6f687dc76ef89ccc1d9263f0657c9ba84\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s2oiq4k2jk471.png?width=1602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e275694d69e12b533bc3c5dddc36b1209bbab1a6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a direct comparison, here is Q4-2021 which was not affected by the ultimatum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tltr5y3jk471.png?width=1420&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06a9df748d7e8133b1116ab3c9e85fbd62196b9e\n\nThe loan volume for RKT increased nearly $3B from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021.  Below is a chart showing you the loan volume for UWMC in that same time period.  As you can see, the loan volume DECREASED by over $5.6B.  A winner has been declared, and it means that RKT is taking market share even quicker due to the ultimatum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this entire war was started to try to stop RKT from taking market share from UWMC.  All UWMC had to do was read a little bit of recent history, and know that competitors tried to do the same thing when Amazon was starting out.  Many vendors refused to use Amazon because they took a fee, and felt they could make more money per sale if they were independent.  Unfortunately those vendors eventually learned that volume can make profits go up faster than premiums with less sales.  Amazon of course won that warm, and RKT will do the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe primary focus for Rocket Companies is very clear when it comes to growth--gain market share.  They are not the least bit worried about profits, because their Direct to Consumer lending is the largest in the US by a long shot.  This plays a key roll in the war with UWMC.  UWMC dropped their interest rates (effectively buying down the interest rate for the customer) to try to keep agents with them when they issued the ultimatum.  Of course, RKT followed suit to match them, and the war is causing the entire industry to see their margins tighten.    Margins for wholesale are roughly 2% for both RKT and UWMC, after dropping the interest rates 50bps.  Direct to Consumer margins are over 5%.   Well, UWMC doesn\'t do direct to consumer lending, so they are fighting a battle they can\'t win.  They can continue to buy down interest rates until they go negative and have no profits if they wanted to.  Rocket Companies will continue to always be profitable because a larger part of their business is Direct to Consumer with higher margins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3klqg3xajk471.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79191aae6c0fd945540479c518d2dd173bcf9fad\n\nIn light of this war, Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner are come out stating their new goal is to be the largest wholesale lender by 2023 (2 years).  They are already the largest overall lender, and the largest direct to consumer lender.  They are winning the market share battle, and numbers don\'t lie.  It comes at a cost of lower margins which reduce profit.  Keep in mind that Amazon wasn\'t profitable for 20 years.  The fact that RKT is hugely profitable is amazing as they continue to acquire market share in the industry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MORE THAN JUST MORTGAGES:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRocket Companies is a FinTech play.  RKT has been testing their technologies in other businesses and have determined that many of them translate to other loan industries.  The one with the largest prospects is automobiles.  Rocket Auto has been testing their products for the past year or so, and are happy with the ability for the technologies to transition into the auto retail marketplace.  Rocket Auto recently formed a strategic partnership with AutoFi, a leading software provider in the automotive retail industry with a network of more than 2,000 dealership partners.  This is not live yet to my knowledge, but during the first quarter, they sold over $360M in volume, and are on track to do over $1B this year.  Rocket owns their own titling company called Amrock.  They make up the bulk of the "Other income" line in their quarterly/yearly reports.  At this point, the auto sales only generated $13M in profit for Q1 2021.  There is no website launched for Rocket Auto yet, and it\'ll take awhile to integrate the technologies in with AutoFi, but this is a huge market which will grow at an exponential rate in the next couple years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g42p4awgjk471.png?width=1142&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dee95ca12421e164975651eed63e82e7f7b3d4c0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6u5n7wqkjk471.png?width=1634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e138940c684d71aa219005ba55336ca51d2d6b4c\n\nAlso, Rocket Mortgage is going international.  They are beginning their expansion in Canada, so this is a very big market which will show lots of growth for years to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INFLATION FEARS:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas inflation increased?  Absolutely.  But it has had very little effect on interest rates.  Interest rates increased at the beginning of the year and were expected to increase for the next 2 years at a very fast rate.  The fact is that analysts guessed wrong.  Fed Chairman has stuck to his word and has not increased rates, and doesn\'t expect to until after 2023.  Interest rates did increase very dramatically at the start of the year, and then it stopped increasing at the end of March.  In fact, interest rates have decreased nearly 0.3% in the past 3 months.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/41c46f2ojk471.png?width=1940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1a7b2dd29fcc14e632ba789d1348be642a25be3\n\nThis is going to cause refinances to pick up again slightly, and investors know it.  RKT has been a notoriously shorted stock since it IPOed because hedge funds believed that it was as good as it gets in the middle of 2020 when they IPOed.  For 2 quarters in a row, RKT proved every naysayer wrong growing more than anyone expected, and be coming more profitable than anyone expected.  EBITDA in 2020 was roughly $11B, and the company\'s market cap sits around $41bln currently.  They are making more money than they can possibly use, so they issued a special dividend last year of $1.11 which was about 5% of the value of the stock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow, you can see the short interest dropped to roughly 8% in march when they reported blow out earnings.  It then increased in May, to roughly 17% in May after earnings showed the gain on sales decreased to to the war with UWMC dropping interest rates half a %, and slightly less refinancing occurring due to interest rates rising at the beginning of the year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznsz1brjk471.png?width=2154&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=679e86c24f24c924e9eac3ea68fc30a5b8b5cde7\n\nAs interest rates have started dropping again, you can see the shorts are leaving the stock.  Roughly 7.5 million shares have come back available in the past two weeks, and interest to borrow has dropped due to lack of demand to short the stock.  Interest rates dropping will have all lending companies out perform expectations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzj988ptjk471.png?width=1632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d13f6ef5e156d0a2e2e6286a09468f2ec0aca563\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, it doesn\'t matter if the housing market does incredibly well over the next 5 years or not.  RKT has made it clear that their goal is to have 25% market share of the mortgage industry by 2030, which is 3 times their market share compared to last year.   They will gain market share even faster in years the housing market is bad, and their retention for customers can\'t be matched.  The industry average return customer is 20%, and RKTs return rate is over 90%.  Their process is simple, digital, can all be done through an app or their website, and has made the lending process infinitely easier than traditional loans.  They make billions of dollars a years, have $1B set aside for share buybacks if they decide that\'s in the shareholders interest, and has a better balance sheet than anyone else in the business.  You pay a slightly higher multiple than you would if you purchased another company like UWMC, but their growth is nearly double UWMC, and they are taking market share away from UWMC, so it\'s worth far more than any other lending company.  In general, all lending companies are undervalued currently, RKT just happens to be the next "Amazon" of lending, and it\'s hard to put a price on that.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe the company is worth around $40 a share currently which is about 100% above where it is trading now.  By 2023, the company should be worth worth around $200B-300B which is roughly  5-7 times current evaluation.  It\'s not the 10 times in 10 years that I felt Tesla was worth in 2010, but there is zero chance RKT goes bankrupt, and there was always a chance Tesla could in the first few years.  Read Elon Musk\'s biography and you\'ll see just how close he was to bankruptcy twice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can\'t tell you when the stock will go up.  The stock price isn\'t reflective of the company currently.  Sometimes they can stay disconnected for awhile.  But I learned my lesson when I sold TSLA to pay off my house.  You never know when a stock is going to explode, you just know that it\'s an inevitability.  While everyone else is running for the next pump and dump on Reddit to hopefully gain 100% in a week (I admit I do this as well although I never put too much in), I\'d rather invest with the majority of my money.  I know that at some point I\'ll see a huge return in the next few years.  Typically in the stock market, it doubles your money every 7 years if you have your money tracking the S&amp;P500.  I\'ve found a company that will give me 5-7 times that amount in near the same time frame.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for all the typos, this got so long, and it\'s so late now that I\'m not going to go back and proof read.'), ('MAD about AMD -

If not, I have even more great news for you! The company has been constantly underestimated/undervalued despite all these great numbers.

AMD is geared more towards the average consumer which makes up a large portion of the computer market. Not only this but AMD chips are appearing more and more in laptops and pre-built computers. Another small point is that Microsoft is using AMD chips in their new generation of Xbox.\n\nAgain, all of this is speculation and I'm not telling anyone what decision to make, this is just my take on it."), ('An alternative to dollar cost averaging into stocks: Retire in 5 years with LEAPs', 'An alternative to dollar cost averaging into stocks: Retire in 5 years with LEAPsTl;dr: DCA every month into index LEAPs instead of index funds to outperform the markets. Crazy right?\n\nDisclaimer: This isn\'t financial advice. I am not a finance professional.\n\nWho this is for: This research is from the pov of salaried folks like me who are midway to FIRE, who have fixed income guaranteed for at least 2 years, and with the optionality to keep working for a bit longer if the strategy goes badly. Our goal is to advance retirement by aiming for higher than market *total* returns - not *risk adjusted* returns (hate that term by the way) or more correctly not *volatility adjusted* returns. If this doesn\'t describe you, this post won\'t be useful to you.\n\n"Dollar cost average into index funds" is the most non-controversial financial advice you can get. It has long been the gospel of bogleheads and other hands-off styles of investors and for a good reason: Stocks follow a Weiner process with positive drift. viz. Over the long term markets go up, and in the years when they go down they fall less than they gain in the years when they go up.\n\nThen the question must be asked - is there a way to leverage this.. loosely speaking.. "guarantee" of positive movement over the long term? What is the safest way to do so?\n\nI could think of 3 ways:\n\n1. Buy index funds on margin. This is well studied and [documented](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=5934). I personally dislike this approach because of interest rate risk, margin requirement change risk, flash crash risk. Besides the only broker which offers a reasonable margin rate (that the dividends on SPY will sufficiently pay for) is IBKR and it comes at the price of not doing margin calls. They\'ll sell your investments at the worst possible time. 110% long is the highest I am willing to go with this method.\n2. Levered ETFs - I am not knowledgeable on this subject but from what I understand they\'re not meant to be held long term due to contango and rebalancing. Please feel free to correct me or add color.\n3. Buy calls. Control the upside on 100x shares for less that the price of 100x underlying. This is the subject of this post\n\nResearch methodology:\n\nI backtested this approach with Quantconnect and found that buying 40 delta calls that expire at least 1 year out (LEAPs) every month and scaling in slowly over 2 years beats the market by 5:1. The approach is not without risks. Options are a wasting asset. The scenario in which it loses the entire capital invested is if the US stock markets behaved like Japan in the 90s.\n\nInvesting in stocks lump sum is preferable to DCA but it would be too risky with options. So we scale in slowly over 24 months, buying a fixed dollar amount worth of SPY LEAPs.\n\nLeverage is set to 1. We won\'t be borrowing money to buy calls. Margins calls are terrifying enough with equity. Built-in leverage is sufficient.\n\nNo stock picking, no market timing, no indicators, no hedging. Wake up once a month, find the expiration that\'s closest to 380 days from today, identify a 40 delta strike (slightly out of money) and buy a preset dollar amount worth. Do this for 2 years. Sell the call 2 weeks before expiry (avoids assignment, gamma risk, accelerated theta decay). After 2 years, stop adding more principal, just reinvest profits the same way as before. For example on June 1st 2021 we would have bought SPY220617C00445000@$194.\n\nWhy 40 delta? 2 weeks? 2 years? These were just common sense starting points. I\'m sure you can fine-tune them but I did not want to risk overfitting the algorithm with additional parameters. OTM calls makes sense intuitively due to volatility skew and the fact that % moves are bigger. ITM calls are more expensive and if I wanted higher delta I\'d just buy shares without expiry risk. SPY was chosen because it\'s as liquid as it gets. The algorithm is buying at ask and selling at bid (market orders). In practice we can try bidding lower/higher with a bit of patience but that\'s the least of our concerns.\n\nInb4 "short term capital gain taxes" - we choose expiry 380 days out + sell 2 weeks before expiry which means holding period always qualifies for LTCG treatment. This makes our approach comparable with "buy and hold index" or "dollar cost average index" on a pre as well as post tax basis.\n\nFinally because of the way the backtesting engine works, I had to seed the algorithm with $500,000 paper money and make $500,000/24 = 21k worth of a purchase each month. This means that in the first 2 years we\'re not fully invested. This cash drag understates the returns a bit but that\'s okay. If you calculate the TWR on invested capital by hand it will be even higher in practice so no harm done.\n\nBacktest was conducted over last 5 years (Jun\'16 to Jun\'21). Yes, this method is empirical, and the 5 years happened to be good for stockholders. But I don\'t have a crystal ball for the next 5 years and this is as scientific as it can get. The important question is whether this strategy has legs or are we paying too much premium to make money over a *sufficiently large and flexible* time period.\n\nResults:\n\n[https://ibb.co/r7wMfwY](https://ibb.co/r7wMfwY)\n\n[https://ibb.co/frswZJn](https://ibb.co/frswZJn)\n\n**Total return for DCA into LEAPs: 609.75%**\n\n**Total return for DCA into SPY shares: 154.49%** (benchmark#1)\n\n**Total return for lump sum SPY shares: 421/190-1 = 121.57%** (benchmark#2)\n\nWorst drawdown - surprisingly low 49.2%\n\nSharpe ratio - 1.23\n\nPSR - 50.4%\n\n(We don\'t give a shit about the last 2 metrics. We knew this was going to be volatile.)\n\nMy takeaway:\n\nUnless a calamity occurs and doesn\'t resolve itself for more than 5 years, this strategy will propel me towards an early retirement. I\'m keeping all my current savings invested in an all weather portfolio, but the new money will buy LEAPs every month. If this works well, see you in walhalla. If this goes tits up, no biggie, keeping my job for 2 more years won\'t kill me. Biggest risk to implementing this strategy well is psychological. Human nature is to equate high win rates with better strategies rather than ones with higher, skewed expectancy. I fully expect some of these monthly purchases to go to zero, but hopefully the others will more than make up for the losses. So long as I don\'t shit my pants and keep buying that is..\n\nFuture research:\n\nExperiment with spreads, calendar spreads, diagonal spreads, active stock picking. Fine tuning deltas.

I mean, I totally know, but I\'m not sure if you, too, are...you know, fellow ape....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHmm, it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard.  This makes fellow ape very angry, and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this, ape honor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, I\'ve seen an enormous amount of confusion from the, you know, "non-apes", about what $CLNE\'s contract with $AMZN is.  So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don\'t get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information.  So let\'s talk about it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What\'s the deal:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide.  This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN\'s warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today\'s value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don\'t know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they\'ll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Now, the part the less intelligent "non-apes" don\'t seem to grasp, but the most important part:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLess discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they\'ve got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it\'s the part most people don\'t seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they\'re paying, which means it\'s in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as "gently nudging" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean "waterboarding until they comply".  You\'re already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why does any of this matter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, "fellow ape", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it\'s this:  If $AMZN\'s "win" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to "win", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE\'s price should not be 13.49 because that\'s what $AMZN is paying, that\'s wrong, and everybody who\'s been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that\'s what $AMZN\'s cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn\'t agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there the "non apes" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn\'t get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO\'d into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn\'t understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can\'t.  Jeff\'s not as wise an ape as a WSB ape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFear and Loathing,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-CD'), ('CLNE DD üêÑüí®=üöÄFuel', 'CLNE DD üêÑüí®=üöÄFuel#  Overview\n\nCLNE is a solid company that has found it\'s niche as the **#1 company in Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), the most eco friendly, reliable, and cost effective renewable energy source in the fast growing green energy industry.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ** A research study conducted by the American Gas Foundation suggested that RNG can meet the energy needs of **half the American population.** üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.

This has also helped it greatly increase their free cash flow, from -41 mil in 2017 to +41 mil in 2020 (for you apes out there, free cash flow is the main indicator of a company\'s health, and growth like this is what attracts the big boys üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.)

(PLUG\'s free cash flow declined from -104.5 mil in 2017 to -205.7m in 2020. PLUG operating costs have also gone up from 131 mil in 2017 to 376 mil in 2020)\n\nCHPT, which rose from \\~$10 in August 2020 to \\~$40 in December 2020, has only released 1 quarter of public financial statements. It is worth noting that their free cash flow is -42 mil for Q12021 while CLNE cash flow declined by only 71 thousand for the quarter. CLNE also show better value when comparing the statistics listed above.\n\nI included Tesla for the hell of it, and what\'s interesting is that Tesla has also struggled to reduce costs, and in many ways CLNE is trading at a discount when you compare some of the key stats I mentioned above.\n\nFinally, FCEL, like many of the other popular clean energy names we\'ve seen here, has also failed to reduce costs and increase cash flow the same way CLNE has been able to, and again they are trading at a higher valuation in comparison to CLNE based on the statistics mentioned above.\n\n# Analyst and WSB Sentiment\n\nFor the factors mentioned above, it is no wonder why CLNE has been shown the love its been getting.

Full disclosure, I am balls deep in contracts and shares (46 Dec 17 40C and ~1300 shares to be specific).\n\nI am going to compare CRSR to ENPH, AMZN, and CRWD. I chose these stocks because I own AMZN and CRWD and am in the solar industry, so I have followed ENPH as well. They are all tech growth stocks. AMZN sells products on the internet and has software subsidiaries. ENPH sells relatively high margin products. CRWD is a growth stock in its infancy. I believe they make for reasonably good comparisons to CRSR because they all have similar revenue growth over the past few years (well, CRWD is slightly higher) and all are part of growing industries.\n\nWhat happened recently? Well, they crushed their Q4 and Q1 earnings. Shares were at about $46 before Q1 and the February sell off hit them hard. Then they bamboozled Q1 and went up for a day, then dropped down to $31-32. It popped a but and Eagle Tree sold 5 million shares at 32 bucks. It appears that ended last Friday. So basically, they had 2 blowout quarters and their share price tanked by just under 50%. Absurd. Volume was usually under 2 million. Today it was over 65 million. That likely means retail bought a huge chunk of shares formerly owned by insiders and institutions.\n\nHere are the numbers (they might be slightly off, I am rounding and sometimes make mistakes):\n\nCompound Annual Revenue Growth rate:\n\nCRWD ‚Äì Last 2.25 years: 41%\n\nAMZN ‚Äì Last 4.25 years: 30.5%\n\nENPH ‚Äì Last 4.25 years: 26.3%\n\nCRSR ‚Äì Last 4.25 Years: 31.8%\n\nCrowdStrike is a relatively new company.

I am going to use the average of the past 2 quarters of company reported earnings for this. \n\nCRWD ‚Äì 506.5\n\nAMZN ‚Äì 55.1\n\nENPH ‚Äì 69\n\nCRSR ‚Äì 16.2\n\nAlright, so this is a bit crazy. I understand that there is a premium on margins, but that should show up in the earnings. Solar industry growth is flattening, ecommerce is growing, but at a much slower pace than before, cybersecurity gets a bump for likely being the fastest growing. And then there is gaming, a continuously growing industry quickly being adopted by the younger generation and played by everyone who is not a boomer. Gamers are getting older, and richer. They are getting real jobs. They spend a good chunk of their disposable income on their girlfriends‚Ä¶ NOT!\n\nThis is absolutely insane. CRSR had a higher growth rate than ENPH, albeit with worse margins, and their past 2 quarters beat ENPH on an EPS basis. ENPH‚Äôs share price is 147. CRSR is 36. WHAT???\n\nCRWD had 999 Mil of revenue in the past 12 months. Their market cap is 52.7 billion. CRSR‚Äôs is 3.32 billion on 1.9 billion of sales.\n\nWMT, just to throw a name out there, had 3.5% CARG over the past 4 years and their PE ratio is *explicit*23. What is going on here?\n\nThe answer is boomers think video gamers are going to stop playing because the pandemic is over. \n\nI don‚Äôt know, man. Their Q1 was great, beat bigly on revenue, margin, and earnings. They said they were supply constrained, I believe it. I think that gamers are going to continue to buy their PCs and memory as fast as they can stock it for the rest of the year. They guided 18% revenue growth for the year and blew out their guidance in Q1. During their earnings call, they said something like it ‚Äúeven beat their internal projections‚Äù which means they think they are going to beat their own guidance. \n\nOK, so what is my point here? Well basically it is that they are growing quickly and already profitable, which is a rare combination and generally earns a PE ratio well north of 35. If their PE ratio was 35 (based on annualizing their most recent quarter) their share price would be $81.2. \n\n‚ÄúWait Sirenor, isn‚Äôt that PE ratio way lower than the other stonks you showed?‚Äù\n\nYes, it is.

The second facility in Karsten is brand new and will enable the company to have extensive tortilla manufacturing capabilities, as well as to be able to customize the existing footprint.

(DD)', '$NIO is worth looking in to! (DD)TLDR:  Nio has great potential, and great tech. however the only things to look out for are financial performance and possible share dilution! \n\nHowever I recommend you read this analysis!\n\nI am sure you all have heard of a Chinese Electric Vehicle manufacturer that goes by the name [$NIO ‚Äì NIO Inc.,](https://utradea.com/stocks/NIO) and I am sure that you have heard them been called the ‚ÄúTesla of China‚Äù but this title is very deceiving and gives the impression that Nio perhaps copied [$TSLA - Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA). However, this is false because Nio has a completely different business model and very different technology (especially in their swappable batteries) than Tesla does. Nio is up nearly 1000% on the year, so I decided to do an analysis to find out what all the hype was about and if this hype can be justified.\n\n**Company Overview:**\n\nNio is a leading manufacturer of premium, smart, electric vehicles. Nio designs, develops, manufactures, and sells their vehicles to their main customer base in China. Furthermore, Nio is constantly looking to improve upon their autonomous driving, digital technology, battery technology and their powertrains, in order to differentiate themselves from their competition.\n\nNio has industry-leading battery swapping technology, which drives their battery as a service (BaaS) business. Additionally, Nio also has proprietary autonomous driving technology, which enables their Autonomous Driving as a Service (ADaaS) business.\n\nNio currently sells their vehicles in China, however they are planning on expanding their business into international markets, to capitalize on the growing demand for EV‚Äôs. Nio has 4 vehicle models, their ES8, ES6, EC6, and their ET7.\n\n**Investment Information:**\n\n*Vehicle Offerings:*\n\n¬∑ **ES8** is a 6-7 seat premium electric SUV that features 2 induction motors (240 kW). The ES8 accelerated from 0-100 kph in 4.4 seconds and is ranked 5 stars by the C-NCAP (Chinese New Car Assessment Program) for their safety standards. Lastly, the ES8 can go roughly 355 km on a single charge. IN 2020, Nio sold 10,861 of their ES8 models.\n\n¬∑ **ES6** is a 5-seat high-performance SUV that features one magnet motor (160 kW) and one induction motor (240 kW). The ES6 can accelerate from 0-100 kph in 4.7 seconds and can reach up to 430km on a single charge. In 2020, Nio sold 27,945 of their ES6 models.\n\n¬∑ **EC6** is a Coupe SUV that features one (160 kW) magnet motor, and a (240 kW) Induction motor. The EC6 is capable of accelerating from 0-100 kph in 4.5 seconds, and it can go 440 km (70 kWh battery) to 615 km (100 kWh battery) on a single charge. The EC6 also features a 2.1 square meter panoramic glass roof. In 2020, Nio sold a total of 4,922 of their EC6 models, basically just in Q4 alone (16 were sold in Q3 and none in Q1/Q2).\n\n¬∑ **ET7** is a Sedan that offers 1 front magnet motor (180 kW), and one back Induction motor (300 kW). The ET7 is very aerodynamic and can accelerate from 0-100 kph in a mere 3.9 seconds. The ET7 has 5-star safety ratings from both Chinese and European Assessment Programs. The ET7 also features their computing system (Adam) and super sensing system (Aquila). This vehicle is said to be able to reach distances of 1000 km on a single charge (with their 150-kWh battery).\n\n*Battery Swapping (BaaS):*\n\nNio‚Äôs battery swapping technology is supported by over 1,200 patents and this technology is supported on all of Nio‚Äôs vehicles. This technology provides Nio customers with the convenience of quickly swapping their battery for another one to continue their journey quicker through a seamless recharge.\n\nNio is releasing their Power Swap Station 2.0 in 2021, which will decrease their swap time to roughly 3 minutes and have the capacity for 13 rotational battery packs. In 2020, Nio had 172 Swapping Stations in 74 cities that swapped 1.4 million batteries.\n\nNio‚Äôs Battery as a Service business generates revenue through ‚Äúbattery subscriptions‚Äù, in which users have flexible subscription options that they can choose to fit their battery swapping needs. Currently, Nio has several subscriptions for both their 70 kWh, and their 100 kWh batteries.\n\nIf a customer were to select the 70-kWh subscription, they would enjoy approximately $11,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of approximately $150 (USD).\n\nIf a customer selects the 100-kWh subscription plan, they will enjoy approximately $20,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of $231 (USD).\n\n*Autonomous Driving (ADaaS):*\n\nNio has worked on their autonomous technology since day one and now delivers their products that come with ‚ÄúNio Pilot‚Äù, their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Furthermore, Nio is about to roll out their Nio Autonomous driving (NAD).\n\nConsisting of 23 sensors, a front-facing tri-focal camera, 4 exterior cameras, 5 radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors and an interior driver-monitoring camera, **Nio Pilot** is Chinas only ADAS that is on the market. [Nio Pilot](https://www.nio.com/news/new-nio-pilot-option-packs-and-navigation-pilot-2020) has fleet learning and AI analysis capabilities that will be able to update their cars over the clous and improve their algorithms using their extensive backlog of driving data.\n\nIn January 2021, Nio announced [their Autonomous Driving capabilities (NAD)](https://www.nio.com/nad). The NAD system was developed in-house and features perception algorithms, localization, control strategy software, and platform software. The NAD technology uses their super computing platform ‚ÄúAdam‚Äù, and their super sensing system ‚ÄúAquila‚Äù.\n\nNio is planning to roll out their NAD to their customers, through a subscription model similar to their battery sapping service. This subscription is estimated to cost users $106 (USD) per month.\n\n*Electric Powertrain:*\n\nNio has developed, designed, and manufactured their own proprietary electric powertrains in house since their inception. Nio makes powertrains that are specific to their vehicles, and through their Firmware over-the-air (FOTA) Nio is able to continually improve, update, and adjust their cars to fit the behaviour of their driver.\n\nNio has greatly improved their motors moving from their 240-kW 2nd generation induction motor to their 300-kW 3rd generation induction motor. Additionally, Nio has improved their magnet motors from 160 kW (2nd gen.) to 180 kW (3rd gen.)\n\nIt is this constant drive to keep improving their technology that will help separate Nio from their competitors and help Nio to become one of the best EV manufacturers.\n\n*Battery:*\n\nNio is very committed to R&amp;D and innovating their battery technology. Currently, Nio offers two battery options: their 70-kWh battery, and their 100-kWh battery.\n\nTheir 70-kWh battery is designed, developed and manufactured in-house, and combines Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese) NCM prismatic cells, liquid cooling systems and intelligent battery management systems.\n\nTheir proprietary and patented 100-kWh battery features thermal propagation prevention, climate thermal management, and bi-directional cloud Building Management Systems (BMS).\n\nNio has also [announced their 150-kWh battery](https://insideevs.com/news/465188/nio-150-kwh-solid-state-batteries-2022/) which is expected to release in Q4 2022, or Q1 2023, which is another large innovation to their existing technology and proves their determination to be the most innovative.\n\n*Intellectual Property:*\n\nNio has developed a number of proprietary technologies throughout their business journey. Nio relies on their ability to protect their technologies and property through the use of patents, patent applications, NDA‚Äôs, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses.\n\nNio currently has 2,654 patents that have been approved, 1,397 patents that are in the application process, 3,373 registered trademarks, 804 trademark applications, 133 copyrights, and 686 registered domain names.\n\n*Financial information:*\n\n¬∑ **Financial Performance (Good):** Vehicle sales are up by 106.08% YoY, and their cost of sales is only up by 63.72%, which means that their margins are improving. This year was Nio‚Äôs first year having a gross profit, which equalled $287M (USD). Their SG&amp;A expenses decreased by 27.88% YoY, which is good and helps their margins. Lastly, Nio decreased their operating loss by 58.42% which shows that they are making their way towards profitability, which would be a huge milestone.\n\n¬∑ **Financial Performance (Bad):** R&amp;D expense decreased by 43.82% YoY. While this usually is a good sign, R&amp;D is important to Nio‚Äôs business model and future successes, so I would like this figure to be higher. Although Nio decreased their operating losses, they still reported a $706M operating loss (USD) and a $813M net loss, this is not favourable for investors and might scare away potential investors.\n\n¬∑ **Stock Incentive Plan:** Nio‚Äôs stock incentive plan was designed to attract and retain the best possible personnel to promote the success of Nio‚Äôs business. Under their 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 stock plans, there are currently 79.32M shares outstanding, that have yet to have been granted. If all of these outstanding shares were to be granted, it would cause dilutionary effects of roughly 6.45%.\n\n¬∑ **Share Options:** As of December 31st, 2020, there are 32.5M common shares available in options that are yet to be exercised (and converted into common shares). If these options were to be exercised, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 2.6%.\n\n¬∑ **Restricted Shares Outstanding:** Currently, there are 1,735,744 shares outstanding that are classified as ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù, these shares will be vested gradually over a period of time, these shares have a weighted-average period of 3.6 years. If these shares were put on the market today it would cause dilutionary effects of 0.14% over 3.6 years, which is essentially negligible.\n\n*Management Team:*\n\nOne of the most important aspects of high-growth stocks is the management team that is heading the company. We have seen awful management teams destroy promising stocks over and over again, so it important to know the management team, their experience, and their track record(s). With that being said, lets dive into Nio‚Äôs management team.\n\n¬∑ **Bin Li (CEO &amp; Chairman):** Mr. Li founded and served as the director for Beijing Bitauto E-commerce Co. from 2000-2006. After that, Mr. Li served as the chairman of the board of Bitauto Holdings. (Formerly listed on the NYSE. Mr. Li has also been named as one of the top 10 most influential/distinguishable people in China‚Äôs automotive industry by CADA in 2008. As we can see Mr. Li has a history in the automotive space and is a distinguished person in the space as well, which can help vouch for his credibility.\n\n¬∑ **Lihong Qin (President &amp; Director):** Prior to Nio, Mr. Qin was the Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Director at Longfor Properties Co. from 2008-2014. Mr. Qin also served as a Senior Consultant and Deputy GM of Anhui Chery Automobile Sales and Service Company form 2005-2008. Mr. Qin has both a background in the Auto Industry (though Anhui Chery) and in the field of management (through Longfor Properties).\n\n¬∑ **Feng Shen (Executive VP):** Mr. Shen worked in several executive management roles prior to working at Nio. Mr. Shen was the President and Chief Technology Officer at Polestar China, President and VP at Volvo Cars China and Volvo Asia-Pacific, Chairman at China-Sweden Traffic Safety Research Center from 2010-2017. Prior to this he worked at Ford Motor Company as a Powertrain manager. Mr. Shen has extensive experience in both the management space (Polestar and China-Sweden Traffic), and the automotive industry (Ford, and Volvo).\n\n¬∑ **Xin Zhou (Executive VP):** Mr. Zhou served as the Executive Director at Qoros Automotive C. from 2009-2015, and prior to this was the Engagement Manager at McKinsey Co. from 2007-2009. Mr. Zhou has experience in both the Automotive Industry, as well as in management positions, and his experience will be an asset for Nio in the future.\n\n¬∑ **Wei Feng (CFO):** Mr. Feng was previously the Managing Director and Head of the auto/auto parts research team at China International Capital Corp. from 2013-2019. Prior to this he was an industry analyst at Everbright Securities from 2010-2013. Mr.Feng has great experience in the financial industry, and has focused on the auto industry and researching the industry.\n\n¬∑ **Ganesh Iyer (Chief Information Officer):** Mr.Iyer has over 32 years of experience In the autonomous technology, hi-tech, manufacturing, and telecom industries. Mr. Iyer was previously the VP of IT at Tesla from 2012-2016 and was the Senior IT roles at VMWare from 2010-2012. Mr. Iyer has plenty of experience that will help him to drive the future progression/growth at Nio.\n\n**Investment Valuation:**\n\nThe only way in which I could value Nio is through a set of comparable analyses. These analyses will compare some of Nio‚Äôs financial ratio‚Äôs/multiples to that of their competitors.\n\n*Comparable Analysis #1:*\n\nIn this comparable I compared Nio‚Äôs financial ratios to that of [$TSLA ‚Äì Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA), [$XPEV ‚Äì Xpeng](https://utradea.com/stocks/XPEV), and [$LI ‚Äì Li Auto](https://utradea.com/stocks/LI).\n\n*EV/Assets:*\n\nWhen comparing Nio‚Äôs EV/Assets multiple to that of their competitors (as listed above), I found that Nio has a fair value of $257.66, which wouldimply a share price increase of 453.39%. This is very optimistic, so I decided to undergo more comparables to find out if this result was consistent.\n\n*EV/Revenue:*\n\nBy Comparing Nio‚Äôs EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (excluding Xpeng because their ratio was not positive), I found that Nio is $196.70, which implies an increase in value of 322.47%. This is quite similar and consistent with the results achieved in the EV/Assets comparable, so I decided to do one last comparable to gain more insight.\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Nio‚Äôs P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $45.19 per share, which would imply a downside risk of 2.94%. This is inconstant with the other 2 results, so I decided to average the results achieved by each comparable to reach an unbiased valuation.\n\n*Average Comparable #1:*\n\nBy taking the average of all 3 comparable that I underwent in this analysis I arrived at a final all-encompassing price target of $166.51, which would imply a price increase of 257.62%.\n\n*Comparable #2:*\n\nI decided to undergo a second comparable to factor out the influence of Tesla on the results of my first comparable. I did this for a variety of reasons, which include Tesla being valued so much higher than the other EV comparable companies, Tesla being the only company located outside of China (this is because Chinese companies tend to be undervalued, so taking the comparable for these solely Chinese companies makes more sense), and these other companies pose more of a threat to Nio given their ***current*** geographical reach.\n\n*EV/Assets:*\n\nBy comparing Nio‚Äôs EV/Assets multiple to XPeng and Li Auto, I found that Nio‚Äôs fair value is approximately $51.64, which would imply a share price increase of 10.91%. this is very reasonable, however I decided to undergo the other comparable to either validate or invalidate this result.\n\n*EV/Revenue:*\n\nBy comparing Nio‚Äôs EV/Revenue multiple to Li Auto (because XPeng does not have a positive EV/Revenue multiple), I arrived at a fair value of Nio of $52.00, which would imply an upside of 11.68%. Once again, this is very reasonable and constant with the result from the EV/Assets comparable.\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Nio‚Äôs P/B multiple to their Chinese competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $37.46, which implies a downside risk of 19.54%. This is not consistent with the results achieved in the previous 2 analyses, and as a result of this I decided to average my results to achieve an unbiased fair value.\n\n*Average Comparable #2:*\n\nBy taking the average of the fair values that I achieved in the 2nd comparable analysis (w/o Tesla), I achieved one all-encompassing fair value of $47.03, which implies an upside of 1.07%, meaning that Nio is approximately at fair value in comparison to their Chinese competitors.\n\n*My Thoughts:*\n\nI think the fact that Nio is undervalued when comparing them to their Chinese competitors is very good for the stock. I believe that Nio should be overvalued compared to them because Nio presents a larger upside. The fact that Nio is undervalued is very bullish, and when incorporating Tesla is extremely bullish. I think the comparable with Tesla will be more applicable when Nio starts to expand their operations internationally, as they will likely start to be valued as less of a ‚ÄúChinese stock‚Äù and more of a legitimate EV company.\n\nI think that investors need to keep up to date with Nio‚Äôs financial reports to make sure that they are on the right track, since here is no way to do a proper DCF right now. But other than this, Nio is looking very bullish.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n¬∑ **Dilution:** Nio has multiple different streams of possible dilution that will negatively affect their shares price, these streams consist of Nio‚Äôs Share Incentive Plan, Stock Options, and Restricted Stock Units. All of these streasm would combine to make a total dilutionary effect of roughly 9.19%, which is not bad. Typically, high growth stocks have large amounts of dilution, and some of Nio‚Äôs dilution is spread over 3 years, so I do not see this being a huge risk, although it is worth keeping in mind.\n\n¬∑ **Financial Performance**: Nio reported an operating loss and net loss of $706M and $813M respectively, this level of loss is not great to see as investors however they are making moves toward profitability which is good to see. Furthermore, Nio almost cut their R&amp;D spending by ¬Ω, which is not favourable in my eyes because I would rather Nio spend the extra money to further develop their technologies and be the most technologically advanced EV maker in China/the World.\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n¬∑ **Financial Performance:** Nio exhibited great growth YOY, while keeping the cost of sales growth significantly lower than their revenue growth. Furthermore, Nio reported a gross profit for the first time and decreased their operating losses significantly. If Nio can continue to improve their financial reports/position, and become profitable in the near future, then this will serve as a huge catalyst for Nio.\n\n¬∑ **Social Sentiment:** According to [Utradea‚Äôs Social Sentiment Tracker](https://utradea.com/feed), Nio is currently the 20th, 16th, and 18th most trending stock om Reddit in the past 4, 24, and 48 hours respectively, with an overall positive sentiment. As we know Reddit can have beneficial impacts on stocks that they target and is important to keep in mind as a current/future investor.\n\n¬∑ **Technology:** Nio has been consistently improving upon their technology, moving from their 1st to 2nd, and now to their 3rd generation of Electric Powertrains. Nio has consistently been improving their motors (both magnet and induction) to futher the technology of their EV‚Äôs and offer superior range. Furthermore, Nio is set to release their 150-kWh battery in late 2022, this battery is expected to have a range of 1000km, if this is true they will have the longest range of any EV by a long shot, which will help show Nio‚Äôs superior technology.\n\nAs you can imagine, this analysis too a lot of time for me to put together, so I would greatly appreciate it if you [follow me](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/WallStreetWhale?utm_source=R&amp;utm_medium=B&amp;utm_campaign=NIO) to read my previous posts nd stay up-to-date on my new posts!\n\n\\*Disclaimer: I currently do not hold any position in $NIO\\*'), ('LORDSTOWN MOTORS IS THE NEXT 10x BAGGER?

Key drivers for growth include: 1) secular decline of traditional TV 2) shift of advertising dollars from traditional TV to connected devices 3) online wagering / betting 4) FUBO is a young company (founded 2015) compared to peers such as NFLX / ROKU (25 years old) and KPIs are growing at triple digit rates.\n* **Subscriber metrics:** Total subscriber count for vMVPDs is \\~11mm households vs \\~73mm traditional paid TV households. Over the next 10 years the executive expects the secular decline of traditional TV will continue and for the subscriber count to drop to as few as \\~25mm households. He expects vMVPDs to capture a significant amount of these traditional TV cord cutters as ‚Äúsubscription fatigue‚Äù sets in for SVOD and AVOD services ‚Äì this will become especially prominent as monthly sub prices increase (e.g Disney+ increased $1/month in Mar‚Äô21). He anticipates 2026 (\\~4-5 years from now) will be an inflection point where vMVPDs will become larger than traditional cable services. The executive highlighted that FUBO‚Äôs sub count typically declines going into Q1 but picks up significantly in Q3 &amp; Q4 as fans become re-engaged with football season ‚Äì in Q3‚Äô20, FUBO added \\~165k subs, Hulu 700k, YouTube 500k, Sling 200k. \n* **vMVPDs vs SVOD:** The executive identified headwinds for SVOD services which will likely limit their long-term growth, requiring them to more widely distribute content on other services including vMVPDs. These are: 1) for SVOD services (excl. NFLX), the cost associated with producing content coupled with the low hit rate of shows is too capital intensive to limit content to their own platforms 2) as the growth in SVOD sub counts slows their profits will decrease but production costs will remain the same or increase. In addition, long-term, the executive expects more simulcast on cable + vMVPDs in order for the cable companies to maximize the value of their content. The need to distribute content on vMVPDs will ‚Äúspark a second wave of growth on the vMVPD side‚Äù. \n* **Betting / Wagering:** The executive remains highly optimistic on FUBO‚Äôs entrance into sports betting due to:  1) FUBO has brand awareness within sports and enormous sports content ‚Äì ‚ÄúI do not see why we could not get to 5% of the betting market‚Äù which is a $70bn market 2) Vigtory acquisition ‚Äì the asset is a fully functioning sports book that FUBO has continued to build upon and improve 3) state licenses ‚Äì FUBO secured 3 licenses in Q1‚Äô21 (IA, IN, NJ) and could launch in \\~80% of markets by the end of 2022 if needed 4) competition ‚Äì FUBO‚Äôs core vMVPD competitors are giants such as GOOGL / YouTube, DKNG and other pure betting companies are much smaller 5) upward trend in vMVPDs gaining sports betting share ‚Äì vMVPDs had 2.8% of the market in 2019 ‚Üí \\~5.5% today. Long-term, FUBO‚Äôs betting platform will have key competitive advantages which include: 1) authenticating the video user with the betting app ‚Äì FUBO will have the betslip open directly to the game being watched on TV vs opening an app and having to find the correct game 2) prop betting ‚Äì FUBO has engaged users watching live games which opens up more opportunities within prop betting vs competitors (e.g. if a user loves field goals, FUBO will bring up a quad view of 4 NFL games all close to having a field goal attempted).\n* **ARPU:** FUBO started at $6.99/month in 2015 ‚Üí $61.00/month today. He attributes the 10x ARPU increase to: 1) strong product / platform 2) targeting customers who understand the value of FUBO‚Äôs bundle ‚Äì \\~40yo males 3) branding ‚Äì FUBO has 10-15% more sports content than competitors 4) value-added functions such as 4k, quad view, calendar view for sporting events, etc‚Ä¶\n* **Price inflation:** FUBO dropped churn in Q3‚Äô21 despite raising prices and continues to see q/q growth. Peers such as Sling and DIS saw lackluster sub growth in Q4 &amp; Q1 and highlighted the headwinds they are facing were based on price increases. Long-term, the executive believes FUBO will continue to be more shielded from price inflation vs peers due to: 1) 95% of FUBO‚Äôs users are sports fans ‚Äì if only 30% of consumers who have cable watch sports, a price increase due to sports programming will isolate the other 70% of the audience 2) adding wagering, which is at a 50% gross margin, will be another revenue stream to handle price inflation 3) media companies who are paying 60-100% more for broadcasting rights will pass this on to users which will shrink their audience and decreasing advertising revenue ‚Üí they will need to distribute further to make up for this lost revenue so vMVPDs will benefit.\n\n**Direct Q&amp;A:**\n\n* **There have been customer complaints about uneven video quality on FuboTV, can he discuss this? A:** ‚ÄúBecause we control our own video coding and delivery, there was a point in 2019 where we were 12 or 13 seconds from the edge and there is a FCC broadcast rule which requires a delay of 9 seconds in case of emergencies. We found people cared more about the quality of the video rather than the lag. We could always change it back whenever we want but for now we still find customers continue to care more about the quality‚Äù.\n* **Explain the Net present value of a subscriber of a traditional cable sub vs a virtual cable sub? A: ‚Äú**The number of attachments sold was 1.23mm in March 2021. With 129 hours of viewership, we will continue to be able to improve our ability to sell more attachments. Right now we are at about $840 of revenue on a run rate basis and we will probably hit \\~$2k long-term including wagering and any additional attachments we would be selling. It would also include commerce ‚Äì we added a button on videos which leads consumers to a commerce platform if clicked so it is like a ‚Äúmini Amazon ecosystem‚Äù where sports and betting are the hook. \n* **Outside of soccer and possibly gambling, what exclusive content does Fubo have? A:** ‚ÄúI believe content should be fully distributed in order to be fully monetized. In terms of what we have today - de facto exclusive - is all NY hockey, the Knicks, all Boston local sports with the Bruins / Red Sox / Patriots / Celtics, Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pirates, the Houston Astros and Rockets, and Pac-12 teams‚Äù.\n* **In the shorter-term, can Fubo become a greater aggregator of content where they bundle OTT streaming services and integrate them for on-demand viewing? A:** ‚ÄúIt is certainly possible but not rational. The entertainment piece is important because it drives usage and stickiness. Sports-only is basically about PPV and the churn rate is \\~35%. Even with this churn the service still showed value because these consumers signed up, had a great experience, rated 5 stars, and dropped after their team lost in the playoffs ‚Äì they got what they wanted. Entertainment allows us to improve our retention because it is an expensive product so it is important to have the consumers come to our platform consistently. That is reflected in our churn numbers in which we have had 8 quarters of sequential churn decline‚Äù.\n* **Most smart TVs are fairly limited in the number of buttons on the remotes, how do you approach this from a UI/UX perspective when competing against phone-based sports betting apps? A:** ‚ÄúAs long as you have anything with a pointer and arrows you will be fine. You‚Äôll see it on Roku in the next 5 weeks or so when we are launching our free-to-play predictive games. Apple will be different ‚Äì we are not planning on launching them soon because it is a more robust platform so we will do more with it‚Äù.'), ("Bezos, Cow Farts, and You: How $AMZN's deal w/ $CLNE is the most confusing in at least 30 seconds; unwinding it so people will stop being so ignorant about it.", 'Bezos, Cow Farts, and You: How $AMZN\'s deal w/ $CLNE is the most confusing in at least 30 seconds; unwinding it so people will stop being so ignorant about it.Hello, "Apes".  it is I...also....ape.  Yes, ape.  Here to bless you with lots of rocket emojis and bananas as I am clearly one of you.  Or something.  We still say on fleek, right? I mean, I totally know, but I\'m not sure if you, too, are...you know, fellow ape....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHmm, it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard.  This makes fellow ape very angry, and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this, ape honor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, I\'ve seen an enormous amount of confusion from the, you know, "non-apes", about what $CLNE\'s contract with $AMZN is.  So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don\'t get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information.  So let\'s talk about it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What\'s the deal:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide.  This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN\'s warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today\'s value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don\'t know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they\'ll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Now, the part the less intelligent "non-apes" don\'t seem to grasp, but the most important part:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLess discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they\'ve got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it\'s the part most people don\'t seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they\'re paying, which means it\'s in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as "gently nudging" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean "waterboarding until they comply".  You\'re already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why does any of this matter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, "fellow ape", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it\'s this:  If $AMZN\'s "win" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to "win", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE\'s price should not be 13.49 because that\'s what $AMZN is paying, that\'s wrong, and everybody who\'s been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that\'s what $AMZN\'s cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn\'t agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there the "non apes" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn\'t get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO\'d into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn\'t understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can\'t.  Jeff\'s not as wise an ape as a WSB ape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFear and Loathing,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-CD'), ('CLNE DD üêÑüí®=üöÄFuel', 'CLNE DD üêÑüí®=üöÄFuel#  Overview\n\nCLNE is a solid company that has found it\'s niche as the **#1 company in Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), the most eco friendly, reliable, and cost effective renewable energy source in the fast growing green energy industry.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ** A research study conducted by the American Gas Foundation suggested that RNG can meet the energy needs of **half the American population.** üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.

Not only is this a feel good trade, putting money into companies to make the world a cleaner and more sustainable place, but it also helps us make a quick buck too.\n\n# Financial Statement Analysis\n\nMore on the company itself, a quick look at its financial statements shows us that for 4 years+, CLNE has consistently brought down costs (from about 312m to 230m) to help improve its profit margins. This has also helped it greatly increase their free cash flow, from -41 mil in 2017 to +41 mil in 2020 (for you apes out there, free cash flow is the main indicator of a company\'s health, and growth like this is what attracts the big boys üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ.) These improvements put CLNE in a good position to take **full advantage** of the growth of the renewable energy space.üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n#  Comparable Companies\n\nI would like to give you an idea of the potential in this play by comparing CLNE to other popular clean energy plays that we\'ve seen pop recently and why CLNE is better (please note these shouldn\'t be taken as direct comparisons.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[As you can see, CLNE is best or second best \\(only to TSLA\\) in these key statisticsüöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/o1brevrgmb571.png?width=574&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7563c815299bb67903cce221e17bb440ef74a7b)\n\nIn comparison to PLUG, which famously rose from \\~$4 in April 2020 to \\~$75 in late January 2021, CLNE not only suggests better value from the statistics listed above, but PLUG has failed to reduce costs and increase cash flow the way CLNE has been able to. (PLUG\'s free cash flow declined from -104.5 mil in 2017 to -205.7m in 2020. PLUG operating costs have also gone up from 131 mil in 2017 to 376 mil in 2020)\n\nCHPT, which rose from \\~$10 in August 2020 to \\~$40 in December 2020, has only released 1 quarter of public financial statements. It is worth noting that their free cash flow is -42 mil for Q12021 while CLNE cash flow declined by only 71 thousand for the quarter. CLNE also show better value when comparing the statistics listed above.\n\nI included Tesla for the hell of it, and what\'s interesting is that Tesla has also struggled to reduce costs, and in many ways CLNE is trading at a discount when you compare some of the key stats I mentioned above.\n\nFinally, FCEL, like many of the other popular clean energy names we\'ve seen here, has also failed to reduce costs and increase cash flow the same way CLNE has been able to, and again they are trading at a higher valuation in comparison to CLNE based on the statistics mentioned above.\n\n# Analyst and WSB Sentiment\n\nFor the factors mentioned above, it is no wonder why CLNE has been shown the love its been getting. About 2/3 of analyst list the stock as a "buy", with price targets ranging anywhere from $11 (around where its currently trading) to $27. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\nThere is the potential for a huge short-term catalyst on 6/18, that will lead to parabolic price jumps should the stock close above $13, putting a shit load of options ITM and forcing a huge amount of buying. Options market also appears to be very bullish on CLNE, with a Put/Call ratio of .12 in today\'s trading (anything below .5 is considered bullish, so this is mega bull üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ) Couple this with the reasons stated above, it is very easy to see why this stock has received so much love for its short and long term potentialüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n**MR CLNE MR CLNE üöÄüí®üêÑ‚õΩ**\n\n# Positions- CLNE 12c 6/18'), ("Bezos, Cow Farts, and You: How $AMZN's deal w/ $CLNE is the most confusing in at least 30 seconds; unwinding it so people will stop being so ignorant about it.", 'Bezos, Cow Farts, and You: How $AMZN\'s deal w/ $CLNE is the most confusing in at least 30 seconds; unwinding it so people will stop being so ignorant about it.Hello, "Apes".  it is I...also....ape.

Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they\'re paying, which means it\'s in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as "gently nudging" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean "waterboarding until they comply".  You\'re already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why does any of this matter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, "fellow ape", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it\'s this:  If $AMZN\'s "win" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to "win", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE\'s price should not be 13.49 because that\'s what $AMZN is paying, that\'s wrong, and everybody who\'s been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that\'s what $AMZN\'s cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn\'t agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there the "non apes" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn\'t get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO\'d into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn\'t understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can\'t.  Jeff\'s not as wise an ape as a WSB ape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFear and Loathing,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-CD')], '2021-06-16': [('Tesla Ultimate DD', 'Tesla Ultimate DDAlright degenerates, how many times have your FDs expired worthless and left you recording your wife getting blown out for the weekend by her favorite day trader bf.

Instead, I want to invest in something real, something that has a backbone in the actual world that isn\'t empty movie theaters, and that something is the TESLA your fellow ape just copped.\n\nBack in the day (1 yr ago) when there were only 1 million retards instead of 10, an individual known as u/WSBgod  showered us with his glorious TSLA gain porn.  Today I am going to tell you why and how you can get your own glorious TSLA gain porn and finally fuck your own wife for once.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDD: The only reason TSLA has the market cap it has today is the potential it has in the autonomous driving market. If TSLA was only priced for cars it sold it wouldn\'t be a multi-billion dollar company, worth more than every other automaker. This is because TSLA isn\'t just an automaker and realizing this will be your greatest asset. **High conviction in a stock strengthens the diamond hands holding it!** Anyway, Musk himself believes that when they solve FSD (Full Self Driving) and update all their cars overnight to be able to drive autonomously that TSLA will see the **largest overnight asset increase in history**. IDK about you but that sounds way better than a squeaker screaming "squeeze" about the latest stock they saw on somebody\'s shirt. Elon has reiterated in earnings calls that he is extremely confident they will solve FSD this year and my own knowledge of watching FSD driving videos they have now along with Elon saying the next new update has 100s of improvements and is supposedly coming out this month tells me that autonomy is much closer than most people realize.   \n\nTLDR: FSD --&gt; Stock to the Moon\n\nDD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving ever, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA announced and showed on their Battery Day all the manufacturing and engineering improvements they made to producing batteries which reduce the battery cost by almost 2/3rds (66%). They already have a pilot plant of these new battery cells along with new battery production plants being build at their new Gigafactories in Austin and Berlin. Hopefully, by now you can tell the world is transitioning to sustainable energies and EVs are becoming much more prevalent across society. All the EVs made by other car companies will require battery packs to make and operate. The only problem is these other car companies do not have the battery technology that TSLA has. Currently, TSLA is unable to produce cars like the SEMI due to a lack of batteries as they wish to prioritize vehicles with a smaller battery pack like the 3 and Y. Once they get all their battery plants online they will produce more cars than they ever have, along with SEMIS and CYBERTRUCKS. Other car manufacturers will run into the problem TSLA is in right now. They will not have the batteries to produce all the vehicles they want to make and if they try buying excess amounts of batteries that are 200% more expensive than the batteries TSLA is using they will not be able to keep up in margins/ pricing. ( This is why the high-end F-150 Lighting is more expensive than the high-end Cybertruck)\n\nTLDR: Batteries --&gt; Stock to the Moon\n\nDD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving and they blow up all their own battery facilities, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA has all the top engineers in the world working for them (this is an underrated aspect of the company in my opinion) and they employ these engineers to do whatever they need to be done. One important team working for TSLA right now is the AI team. TSLA is currently in the development of **DOJO,** a neural net trainer. I\'m not gonna pretend to know everything about this because it is way beyond my realm of understanding but what I do know is that **AI runs on DATA.** The more data you have to train your NN, the smarter your AI is. Currently, TSLA has the largest data lead as their cars have **billions** of miles driven on the road whereas the runner-up of Google\'s Waymo has a laughable **millions**. When DOJO is available TSLA will be able to train its NN with all its data which will result in the best autonomous driving technology available. Beyond training FSD, Dojo can be used to train any NN that Tesla or other companies will have uses for. Dojo is one of the most valuable assets for AI that will exist and that should be valued extremely high in my opinion as I believe AI will be the next largest breakout in society.\n\nTLDR: AI &amp; DOJO --&gt; Stock to the Moon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crazy thing about this DD is that I still haven\'t covered many of Tesla\'s massive opportunities such as its entire energy business or the future MODEL 2 that will eventually come out. Note that the MODEL 2 is a 25k Tesla which after factoring in the cost savings and any EV incentives that may come out will be the most affordable and best EV for its price and utility. (will hopefully be autonomous as well)  I think basically anyone with a brain will buy the MODEL 2 and it\'ll kinda be like Apple unveiling the iPhone. Basically, everyone uses an iPhone for their phone now and I think once an EV like the Model 2 comes out everyone will be whipping a Tesla for their car. \n\nMore points if somehow you still aren\'t convinced\n\n\\- Giga factories almost complete in Berlin ( one more month) and Austin (by end of year) this will result in crazy amounts of cars being made and more importantly CYBERTRUCKS\n\n\\- Gigapresses at these factories will manufacture cars faster than anything that has been done before. This translates into the CYBERTRUCK ramp being extremely fast.\n\n\\-Tesla sells every car they make and yet many terrible news sources say TSLA has demands problems. Elon himself has stated demand is the least of their worries.\n\n\\-SEMIS are being slept on, they will start coming out by the end of this year and probably take over the trucking industry the next year. Autonomous truck convoys are the future as they are so much more cost-effective.\n\n\\-Overall TSLA is trying to save the world and make it a better place by transitioning to sustainable energy and solving crazy intense real-world problems like FSD which will reduce the driving death count drastically. If you disagree with this please comment cause I would like to understand your perspective on how I am wrong.\n\n\\- WSB says they like meme stocks so much well what other CEO is constantly posting memes on Twitter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you actually read all this and still think TSLA is overvalued please reply why after buying puts or if you really are a man sell some naked calls.\n\nPOSITIONS: TSLA 1/21/2023 1500, 1600, 1700 strikes\n\nnote that u gotta buy leaps, not weeklies cause ELON loves to lie about the timing of things.

However, I‚Äôm not going to get into that. My goal with this post is to explain how CLOV is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, much like TSLA did in the auto industry, and give my perspective on why it will outperform its competitors.\n\n**TL;DR - First, intro - they‚Äôre changing the game just like Tesla did back in the day. Next, they‚Äôre growing, but the haters gon hate. Why? Because CLOV is the first of its kind and troglodytes hate change! Wrap it up - be dead inside, cuz studies show the highest returns went to people who are dead or forgot their account.**\n\n**This is 10% Luck, 20% Skill**\n\nHave you or a loved one ever gone to the doctor more than once to get a diagnosis for a problem you can‚Äôt figure out? The doctor reviews your file each time, but always gives the same answer: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do another test. I‚Äôll refer you to‚Ä¶‚Äù It seems like you‚Äôre never making progress because either your doctor has run out of ideas or isn‚Äôt familiar enough with your medical history. Now imagine an elderly person navigating this same system, trying to remember what tests they‚Äôve had done and their results on their own. This is impossibly difficult for anyone to deal with, and it‚Äôs exactly the problem Clover Health is trying to solve.\n\nTheir AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient‚Äôs medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts.\n\n**15% Concentrated Power of Will**\n\nClover Assistant is offered for free, and currently they‚Äôre taking a yearly net loss to improve their AI, which will eventually pay off just like Tesla‚Äôs AI. One problem they may face in future is their competitors integrating machine learning into their platforms as well, but by then Clover will be years ahead of them with no hope of any of them catching up.\n\n**5% Pleasure, 50% Pain**\n\nLast week CLOV announced new partnerships with [Upward Health](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upward-health-announces-contract-clover-124500091.html) and the [U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244291/0/en/Clover-Health-to-Scale-In-home-Primary-Care-Program-Through-Direct-Contracting.html), expanding their in-home and virtual service offerings. Considering the trend towards virtual healthcare, this is extremely good news and helps strengthen its fundamentals/growth. Everyone can clearly see how well Teladoc is doing with their in-home service, and this integration will only continue to improve and expand as they cater to our convenience/laziness. This is not priced in due to the volatility in the stock market.(Sidenote: If Hindenturd‚Äôs claims were even remotely true, CLOV would not be expanding their partnership with Medicaid/Medicare only for it to fizzle out in a year.) Besides, with all the fear of inflation, it‚Äôs important to remember that healthcare companies do really well during inflationary periods, unlike most other industries.\n\nIn spite of the evidence of growth, you‚Äôll continue to hear nothing but bad press about CLOV, particularly being compared to its competitors. These comparisons are nonsensical for multiple reasons: first, this is not an outdated, dying business, it has a real future in the rapidly growing healthcare tech industry. Secondly, none of CLOV‚Äôs competitors currently integrate machine learning into their platform and are still using archaic methods of service delivery. Similarly, TSLA had bad PR almost daily when constantly compared to regular auto makers, even as the company continued to roll out new and improved technology like their autonomous driving tech. I did not let the bad press deter me from purchasing TSLA for $38-40 per share (price after split), and as the market and media has realized the nuance and innovation of the company my conviction paid off. CLOV is the same - it‚Äôs not just a regular health insurance company, it‚Äôs a disruptive tech company that uses AI to enhance its database for more profitable and superior care for their future growth. (Sidenote - One of my favorite investors Baillie Gifford has 5 million shares of CLOV, and he bought 2.3 million shares of TSLA at $8 a share during its bearish news cycle period.)\n\nCircling back, why do so many analysts have negative sentiment towards Clover Health? It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre constantly comparing it to the outdated healthcare insurance companies, the same exact way Tesla was compared to Ford, GM, Toyota, and Nissan. In Tesla‚Äôs time, there was nothing else to compare it to - Tesla was the only one of its kind in its sector. Heck, Tim Cook wouldn‚Äôt even meet with Elon when he tried to sell his company to Apple for pennies on the dollar in 2018. Imagine passing on what would become a trillion dollar company - **MISSED OPPORTUNITY EEEEEK.** \n\nIf the negative press was so convincing, it begs the question why didn‚Äôt institutions and Chamath dump some or all their shares at $28 per share? Because they‚Äôre not paperhand losers. These institutions rarely sell their stocks for a 2-3x return; when they invest, they‚Äôre looking to hold long for a much, much greater return. They base their investment decisions on solid fundamentals, therefore if they are still holding CLOV the company must have a legitimate future of success. **Institutions are not emotional.** Retail investors, on the other hand, are the real paperhands. Many get in for the short-term, make 100% return, give away 30% to Uncle Sam, and leave with 70% in change. This isn‚Äôt a bad return at all by any means, but a lot is left on the table when one makes emotional decisions. Take a look at any successful company and their stock volatility over its lifetime, and you‚Äôll see MANY major dips. Folks who sold on those dips are probably filled with regret, but the Buffets of the world, who are dead inside, have reaped the rewards.\n\n*"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."* \n\n* Warren Buffett\n\n**And 100% Reason to Remember the Name (CLOVER HEALTH!)**\n\nLike I said before, I‚Äôm not here to talk about the short-mid term potential of CLOV $100+, but rather the long-term potential of CLOV $100+. If y‚Äôall have been following Chamath as I have, you‚Äôll know he\'s known for making conservative valuations. In 2018, he said Tesla would triple... it actually went 22.5x at its peak (currently at 15x). Whether you like the guy or not, he has a stellar track record. On top of that, he is one of the very few who stood with retail investors against market manipulation. This short-term volatility doesn‚Äôt deter me - I am long on this company, and will not sell my position for a measly 2-3x gain.\n\nI‚Äôll leave you with what I think is the most succinct outlook on Clover Health that‚Äôs been shared.\n\n*‚ÄúSo when you bring all of this forward and you think about the future, here‚Äôs what I see in a nutshell: Number one‚Ä¶ is a business that is actually delivering the promise of technology improving better outcomes and lowering costs in healthcare. Number two is a market that I think is huge and growing quickly. And number three is a business that is consistently taking share year over year over year. And so when you put all of these things together, in my opinion, this is one of the most straightforward investments I‚Äôve ever made. It‚Äôs a business that I think will become extremely valuable. It will build a lot of enterprise value, and will be what I think is going to be our next 10x in 10 years investment.‚Äù*\n\n* Chamath Palihapitiya'), ('CLOV is my next TSLA', 'CLOV is my next TSLA[removed]'), ('Daily option statistics for AMC, CLNE, BB, WISH, GME, WKHS, CLOV, PLTR, CLF, and others.', 'Daily option statistics for AMC, CLNE, BB, WISH, GME, WKHS, CLOV, PLTR, CLF, and others.Hey guys,\n\nHere is the daily option statistics for the most talked about stocks on WSB.\n\nAcross the board we are having green on the big names. $AMC shot up at 10%, CLNE and BB reclaimed some of their lost ground at +3.93% and +4.89% respectively.

He is the negotiator for one side of american politics.\n\nThis matters because PLTR relies on large govt. contracts and MUST maintain a neutral political position.\n\nIt\'s other founder is Peter Thiel, or **Daddy Thiel.**  You might say he is a powerful man, and he handles the other side of american politics.\n\n[Thiel is an extremely influential and powerful billionaire contrarian known for playing 3D chess and looking decades out...PLTR is his baby.](https://preview.redd.it/knpdewpcht571.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e83e232d334be4533531385d1ed5fe15e8297495)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why does the govt. buy their software?**\n\nTheir software can take unbelievable amounts of video data, and give predictions on where enemies might attack, and various other events on a battlefield like it\'s a videogame.  The **CIA** helped them create their technology, and **SOCOM** just renewed a $300M a year contract with them.

In-fact, Peter Thiel himself has a book and has given speeches on the power of moats and "not competing, but forming a monopoly."  Zero to One.\n\n**So why all this info?  It\'s critical to understand the facts I am about to present to you.**\n\nWith a ton of hype, and plenty of meme power, PLTR rose to past $40 a share earlier this year.\n\nMost if not all did not truly understand how special the technology was, and it fell on FUD surrounding stock based compensation and Daddy Karp selling shares.  We will get to this FUD at the end.\n\nW**hy it\'s special:**\n\n**MOAT:  I see people say, "it\'s just data analytics, anyone can compete with them." no.**\n\nThis is like people saying, "it\'s just an airplane copy it and it should fly great."  An analytics platform that is able to "gameify" real world problems in real time and present solutions using integrated Ai/ML is a MASSIVE engineering problem.  Think, a ton of PHD level skilled engineers making the highest salaries in Tech.  So much, that they can retire after a few years if they want.  Now imagine them working for 17 years on something before any other company even thinks to start competing.  This is a bigger moat than many darlings of the tech world have in their software, such as TSLA, which had google, apple, etc. working on competing solutions for years.  And it has saved it\'s clients MILLIONS in Skywise.  For anyone in the software space; you know how brutal implementation is for SAP and similar platforms.  Often it\'s unsuccessful and expensive.  PLTR is already demonstrating PROFITABLE implementations.  This is a sign of a massive moat for anyone who understands the enterprise software world.\n\n[This is just a summary of one application of PLTR\'s Skywise platform; built on Foundry.  They are going to do this to every industry; true prescriptive analytics with rapid deployment of a custom solution.  If you understand that, it\'s insane.

Their margins aren\'t the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status, but they are landing $300M govt. deals (SOCOM) and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY.\n\nTheir revenue growth officially is about 30% per year.\n\nHowever, as all SAAS companies do, internally they have a goal/target of around 50% per year.  That is absolutely achievable, in fact a few large deals can accomplish this, AND MUCH MORE.  I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals (just ONE big deal would annihilate that number) and they have been offering their product for literally less than a year now...\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[With two Daddy\'s like this, what could go wrong?

That\'s expensive, time consuming, hard to scale!  Companies won\'t buy it.**\n\nSAP is horrible and it\'s implemented all the time, takes years to implement, costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement, and is often not successful.  It\'s actually a running joke in the enterprise software world.  Palantir has a history of successful implementations (it\'s custom but designed so low-code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise), a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity (lul).  **This is like a SMART salesforce, which by the way, was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth $400B now, and it has competition in the CRM space.  PLTR is the next evolution, and has ZERO competition.**\n\nSalesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise. \xa0Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your ‚Äúsky net‚Äù and tell you what to do. \xa0It literally is that incredible. \xa0It‚Äôs true mass available prescriptive analytics, sprinkled across an entire company.\n\n**Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms, has no competition, and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2.   Daddy Karp made the most of any CEO this year and he sold hundreds of millions of shares!**\n\nThe way he is paid, his Stock granted is income.  So he pays TAXES on it.  That means he has to sell shares just to cover the taxes so he doesn\'t go to federal prison.  The dude can\'t pay it any other way he doesn\'t have hundreds of millions of dollars laying around...he\'s spent 17 years building this as his baby.  This is all stupid media FUD because it makes awesome headlines and scares the shit out of boomers that aren\'t used to the financing around an insanely fast growing software company.  The numbers look crazy on the surface but make sense once you realize it\'s all because of the meteoric rise in the stock price.\n\n**3.  They are compensating their employees with Stock! It Dilutes us!**\n\nThey are hiring the worlds best software engineer PHD Data Scientists to make sure their moat and monopoly doesn\'t even come close to being encroached on.  These people are expensive.  They continually train their models in their client\'s environments, without keeping their clients data, only evolving their own model.  This maintains privacy and creates momentum for their algorithm that makes it impossible to catch up to PLTR\'s Foundry.  Think google with their threatgraph for search.  They have too much data and too much time refining their algorithms for anyone to catch them in that category.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Price Targets:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Holy Fucking Shit, look at that Q1 rev. growth despite being brand new to enterprise...](https://preview.redd.it/rkgyuszcuq571.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14ea1be3ff5dbdbadd731a7ae8a69d94fcabe713)\n\nIf they grow at the internal, non-sandbagged rate they think they will hit **according to internal docs shared with public (google Q4 2020 PLTR business update, can\'t link).**\n\nThey will have $4B in revenue, in 4 years.  Imagine in 4 years, if a SAAS company was priced at just 10x Revenue with 50% + growth yoy....which will accelerate as proof of concept is demonstrated at large orgs.\n\n**My price target is $80 EOY** because I believe at least one HUGE contract will roll in that will provide further proof of FOUNDRY as a concept and the impact will be undeniable.  Companies will be lining up to get Foundry and projected demand will show implied growth off the charts that no one has accounted for.  The Skywise project finalized my opinion on this, PLTR told them WHEN VALVES IN ENGINES WERE BEHAVING ODDLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO FAILURE, OPTIMALLY, TO SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR PER AIRLINE IN SCHEDULING AND OTHER COSTS you can read about that on another subreddit, the info is out there if you do a google search on skywise.\n\n**Price target in 4 years: $500.  1. its Cathy Bae\'s Number(not for that time period)**, but also because I think revenue growth will be more like salesforce was as a necessary platform to enterprises.

What history you ask? US Steel stock peaked exactly 13 years ago in June 2008, along with many other steel stocks, then proceeded to fall off a cliff due to the 2008 financial crisis stemming from overleveraged greedy ass wall street banks getting defaults on their mortgage gambles. This was amplified by the fact that steel production was at 90% capacity for these companies all jumping in to take advantage of the bubble that had formed, raising HRC prices to then-All-Time-High of \\~$1000.

Things are better for the company than they have been in years, but the analyst simply likes other stocks better.

He knows.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Technicals** \\- Here\'s some charting back 9 months on $X and $CLF (orange line) compared - **From the technicals, my findings are as follows:**\n\n[X and CLF compared charts, 9 months](https://preview.redd.it/am3d7uhgot571.png?width=1360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8405aef585e9cbd68f46980d0f24a7904c069a05)\n\n* CLF shares historically trade below X by \\~$2-$4. This changed in February 2021, circled in chart as #1, due to X offering 42 million shares to the public, increasing the float up to \\~250m shares. I thought this would be the turning point for CLF but investors gobbled it up and the dip was short-lived.\n* This told me X is gonna X no matter what, it\'s the United Steel States Corporation founded by J.P Morgan himself among others. Even with ZERO recent hype while $CLF has WSB eyes for a week, you can see that X moved parallel (as steel should) to CLF, and maintains the lead. That will continue. CLF goes up, X will rise harder. More upside.\n* **2** indicates the run-up pre/post earnings. Most steel companies report earnings at a similar time. CLF will be the next one in mid-July. Imagine steel companies continue trading sideways while their predominant steel product in HRCs rise to new ATH\'s in a recovery summer with infrastructure plans on the horizon and severe supply shortages. Can\'t? Me neither. Pleas fly again.\n* **3** leading up to 4 in yellow circles are the market pullbacks in May, triggered by worse-than-expected CPI report. Remember last month? PLTR bled all the way down to $16, digital currency took a massive 50% hit from ATH, and Cathie Wood was no longer giving you wet dreams. But X steel? 24% dip down to $23.40 level, bought up immediately again within the week. Now, chilling on the resistance.\n* **4** is resistance. Even on bloody days, X refuses to dip below \\~$25.75 and $25.40. It\'s there right now as I type. Apart from that bloodbath in May, X does not dip below that channel in the two-month chart. Yesterday, it hit this mark again - market bled and X hit this resistance for the 10th time in 2 months. And I am about $35k USD certain that it\'s ready to bounce to a new high. Inflation is real, so where does money go? Hold cash and lose money? Lol, no. "Guarantees". Bonds/Trusts. Cyclicals. Companies that make money. X is going to make some damn money this year. Where does JP Morgan want to put their $500 billion?([https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-stockpiled-500-bln-cash-prepare-higher-inflation-2021-6-1030522253](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-stockpiled-500-bln-cash-prepare-higher-inflation-2021-6-1030522253)) "Steel is a generational opportunity" their words.\n* X had lower earnings during the pandemic compared to CLF, but reported higher earnings (Adjusted EBITDA / EPS) in Q1 2021. As X has higher margins, assets and debt overall, US steel has a lot more room for recovery/growth than other steel stocks, which it is primed to obtain AND beyond at this rate. The Return of the King is in the works.\n* X has dividends. It\'s small, but a company to post one of their most profitable years in history with raised guidance after a shares offering will likely return something to shareholders. RKT special $1 dividend? Torchlight Energy special preferred A dividend share? Not sure. Expecting something on this front towards their earnings next month however.\n* Price targets by analysts don\'t matter and often, I\'m more tempted to sell than buy depending on the coverage. But JP Morgan along with other banks are hoarding literal billions in cash due to QE, inflation and low rates, and they won\'t sit on it for long, they\'re going to buy in, if not already. They are smart money after all. Here are the price targets for $X.\n\n\\-Credit Suisse - $35 May 4\n\n\\-Morgan Stanley - $32 May 17\n\n\\-UBS Group - $30 June 4\n\n\\-JP Morgan - $41 June 16 (yesterday)\n\n\\-Goldman Sachs - $25 April 9 - this is outdated and will update by end of this month probably. No way we see below $30 in July IMHO.\n\n* Thus, upside potential is higher for X. Among American steel stocks like $CMC, $NUE, $SCHN, $STLD, $CLF, and $X, US steel ran the least Year-to-Date (+50.51%). X steel also had the highest of highs among Steel stocks in \'08.\n\n[Steel Armageddon \'08](https://preview.redd.it/hlvyxzxoot571.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fbc5f50b75d14f677e2a0c8c10a4d67654a4d65)\n\n**But honestly, fundamentals mean shit and this is a casino. So here are two main reasons why I like $X.**\n\n**1. Market Capitalization:** X\'s market cap is one of lowest among steelmakers. Their float at \\~260m shares is half of \\~500m in $CLF and other stocks like $WISH, $AMC, $BB, so on. Market cap is the biggest reason why we likely will never see something like $GME again. Before last week, CLF\'s daily volume of \\~18m(4% float) was lower than X\'s volume of \\~21m(9% float), despite having double the available shares. X moves more swiftly and momentously than you can expect of this boomer. I imagine X\'s volume to üöÄüöÄ heading into July without a doubt. They are THE United States Steel after all, soon to post historical earnings in a commodity boom.\n\n**\\*\\*2. The United States Steel Corporation. US Steel. Ticker -X-.\\*\\*** Fucking X.

That being said I‚Äôm not too worried cuz I‚Äôm pretty sure most of you retards don‚Äôt even know what SWOT is.\n\n$ASO\n\n**Strengths** ‚Äì I won‚Äôt spend too long on strengths because honestly there have been a lot of great DD on ASO, which I‚Äôll link below.\n\nThe tl;dr of strengths is: ASO is a company in a booming outdoors stores sector with strong fundamentals that has been blowing out earnings and steadily rising since they IPO‚Äôd last October. They have a below 10 P/E and sell guns/ammo in the south (as someone who used to live in Texas I know that y‚Äôall southern motherfuckers love your fucking guns).\n\n[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o18a7j/hunting_bears_with_aso/) by [u/TSLA\\_WHISPERER](https://www.reddit.com/u/TSLA_WHISPERER/)\n\n[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o14jei/aso_this_week/) by [u/Hyptisx](https://www.reddit.com/u/Hyptisx/)\n\n[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1xxd9/get_your_aso_in_here_a_long_term_performing/) by [u/absolutcity](https://www.reddit.com/u/absolutcity/)\n\n[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1h53n/aso_some_sloppy_toppy_due_dickigence/) by [u/mypenismychoice](https://www.reddit.com/u/mypenismychoice/)\n\n**Weaknesses** ‚Äì The same way that gun/ammo sales set ASO apart, it also could be its downfall. Gun rights are a huge hot topic in America. Regardless of how you fall on it politically, anything gun related has chance of being badly hurt by gun regulation. This is also a reason to be cautious about expansion of ASO. Although they have been great about careful and controlled expansion, their heavy involvement in gun sales could affect expansion to more regulated states. We have also seen a huge pullback in outdoorsy companies like ASO, BGFV, DKS and others the past 5 days, with ASO dropping 7% in that timeframe.\n\n**Opportunities** ‚Äì This dip is a great opportunity to buy in, if you believe in the company. Before an earnings report that beat EPS expectations by 128%, the share price was 37.78. Today it closed at 37.77. It seems almost inconceivable to me that we don‚Äôt see significant growth in the coming weeks. Although I don‚Äôt rely solely on price targets, their average price target is around 45 across several different analysts. In a recent investor‚Äôs conference, they also discussed the possibility of dividends as they continue to expand and reduce debt and increase profits. We are coming out of a pandemic that will most likely drive people outside as well as increase the need for sports equipment, potentially increasing sales (although this is a double-edged sword I‚Äôll explain below).\n\n**Threats** \\- Surprisingly, ASO has been greatly benefited by COVID. ASO was shorted pretty heavily at first because the general thought was that an outdoors store would be wrecked by COVID. In reality the pandemic caused a crazy increase in home gyms, treadmills, bikes, etc. This was a main driver of the blowout earnings ASO has reported the past two quarters. These pandemic-driven sales will obviously fall to the wayside, so if sales in other areas don‚Äôt pick up the slack we could see a slowing down in earnings and revenue from ASO stores.\n\nI honestly don‚Äôt really give a fuck if you buy ASO. I do think that ASO will continue to rise and that this is where safe money goes. I have no problem with pump and dumps, I think they are great ways to make a shit ton or lose everything, like the casino this is. If that‚Äôs all you wanna do with your portfolio, good for you, lambo or wendy‚Äôs bitch. ASO is a stock that will give you consistent and significant gains in the coming months, so I don‚Äôt want y‚Äôall to bitch at me that I didn‚Äôt warn you when I post my gain porn.

Typically a vertical call spread is when both calls are opened at the same time and are referred to as a debit spread when you pay upfront for the position and a credit spread when you get paid upfront. Your current position in this example would be a debit spread, BUT you made 40 dollars by opening the position at different times. Because you took the risk of having naked contracts and the underlying went in your favor, youre now enabled to make plays like mentioned above. Ghetto spreads are a way of capping your risk (loss) however it also caps your gains.\n\nMax Gain\n\nShould SPY remain above 421 on expiry, you can close out both calls for an additional profit of 100 dollars. Meaning your overall gain was 140 bucks on 120 (or 116%).\n\nMax Loss\n\nShould both calls expire worthless, you still made 40 bucks on 120 (or +33%).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow is this not a daytrade?

From $200M to $648M in 2020. Operating margin has improved from negative to positive territory, to 5.7% at present.\n\n- During 2020 people upgraded their living conditions at home, this resulted in a 2020 net revenue increasing 51% YoY to $649M. Gross margin also improved from 44.1% in 2019 to 47% in 2020 due to lower input costs.\n\n- 2020 operating expense dropped to 36.1%, this caused a 339% YoY increase in operating income, to $71.2 million. This is stellar performance.\n\n- Management pivoted the company well during the pandemic, as last year direct-to-consumer revenue increased by 83%, and wholesale revenue still increased slightly.\n\n- The pandemic broadened it\'s consumer base. Management plans to increase this momentum by expanding its retail and online presence:\n"With our additional manufacturing capacity coming online, we intend to lean into accelerated wholesale door growth. Our current plan is to add approximately 1,500 new doors in 2021, with a focus on both expanding our footprint with existing partners as well as launching with additional leading regional furniture players.\n\nNow to launching a new e-commerce platform. We have been developing the new design and platform for much of 2020. In order to capitalize on immediate opportunities during the stay-at-home fuel demand, we deferred some of the work into this quarter."\n\n- Analysts are projecting strong earnings growth for the next two years, with 14% and 28% EPS growth estimates for 2021 and 2022.\n\nSummary:\nPurple has been a good investment over the past year, due to rapid consumer adoption of its products. Management continues to invest in growth and expand their consumer reach. This is supported by growth seen before the Pandemic. The recent dip is a good buying oppurtunity. As always, do your own DD.

However, I‚Äôm not going to get into that. My goal with this post is to explain how CLOV is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, much like TSLA did in the auto industry, and give my perspective on why it will outperform its competitors.\n\n**TL;DR - First, intro - they‚Äôre changing the game just like Tesla did back in the day. Next, they‚Äôre growing, but the haters gon hate. Why? Because CLOV is the first of its kind and troglodytes hate change! Wrap it up - be dead inside, cuz studies show the highest returns went to people who are dead or forgot their account.**\n\n**This is 10% Luck, 20% Skill**\n\nHave you or a loved one ever gone to the doctor more than once to get a diagnosis for a problem you can‚Äôt figure out? The doctor reviews your file each time, but always gives the same answer: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do another test. I‚Äôll refer you to‚Ä¶‚Äù It seems like you‚Äôre never making progress because either your doctor has run out of ideas or isn‚Äôt familiar enough with your medical history. Now imagine an elderly person navigating this same system, trying to remember what tests they‚Äôve had done and their results on their own. This is impossibly difficult for anyone to deal with, and it‚Äôs exactly the problem Clover Health is trying to solve.\n\nTheir AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient‚Äôs medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts.\n\n**15% Concentrated Power of Will**\n\nClover Assistant is offered for free, and currently they‚Äôre taking a yearly net loss to improve their AI, which will eventually pay off just like Tesla‚Äôs AI. One problem they may face in future is their competitors integrating machine learning into their platforms as well, but by then Clover will be years ahead of them with no hope of any of them catching up.\n\n**5% Pleasure, 50% Pain**\n\nLast week CLOV announced new partnerships with [Upward Health](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upward-health-announces-contract-clover-124500091.html) and the [U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244291/0/en/Clover-Health-to-Scale-In-home-Primary-Care-Program-Through-Direct-Contracting.html), expanding their in-home and virtual service offerings. Considering the trend towards virtual healthcare, this is extremely good news and helps strengthen its fundamentals/growth. Everyone can clearly see how well Teladoc is doing with their in-home service, and this integration will only continue to improve and expand as they cater to our convenience/laziness. This is not priced in due to the volatility in the stock market.(Sidenote: If Hindenturd‚Äôs claims were even remotely true, CLOV would not be expanding their partnership with Medicaid/Medicare only for it to fizzle out in a year.) Besides, with all the fear of inflation, it‚Äôs important to remember that healthcare companies do really well during inflationary periods, unlike most other industries.\n\nIn spite of the evidence of growth, you‚Äôll continue to hear nothing but bad press about CLOV, particularly being compared to its competitors. These comparisons are nonsensical for multiple reasons: first, this is not an outdated, dying business, it has a real future in the rapidly growing healthcare tech industry. Secondly, none of CLOV‚Äôs competitors currently integrate machine learning into their platform and are still using archaic methods of service delivery. Similarly, TSLA had bad PR almost daily when constantly compared to regular auto makers, even as the company continued to roll out new and improved technology like their autonomous driving tech. I did not let the bad press deter me from purchasing TSLA for $38-40 per share (price after split), and as the market and media has realized the nuance and innovation of the company my conviction paid off. CLOV is the same - it‚Äôs not just a regular health insurance company, it‚Äôs a disruptive tech company that uses AI to enhance its database for more profitable and superior care for their future growth. (Sidenote - One of my favorite investors Baillie Gifford has 5 million shares of CLOV, and he bought 2.3 million shares of TSLA at $8 a share during its bearish news cycle period.)\n\nCircling back, why do so many analysts have negative sentiment towards Clover Health? It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre constantly comparing it to the outdated healthcare insurance companies, the same exact way Tesla was compared to Ford, GM, Toyota, and Nissan. In Tesla‚Äôs time, there was nothing else to compare it to - Tesla was the only one of its kind in its sector. Heck, Tim Cook wouldn‚Äôt even meet with Elon when he tried to sell his company to Apple for pennies on the dollar in 2018. Imagine passing on what would become a trillion dollar company - **MISSED OPPORTUNITY EEEEEK.** \n\nIf the negative press was so convincing, it begs the question why didn‚Äôt institutions and Chamath dump some or all their shares at $28 per share? Because they‚Äôre not paperhand losers. These institutions rarely sell their stocks for a 2-3x return; when they invest, they‚Äôre looking to hold long for a much, much greater return. They base their investment decisions on solid fundamentals, therefore if they are still holding CLOV the company must have a legitimate future of success. **Institutions are not emotional.** Retail investors, on the other hand, are the real paperhands. Many get in for the short-term, make 100% return, give away 30% to Uncle Sam, and leave with 70% in change. This isn‚Äôt a bad return at all by any means, but a lot is left on the table when one makes emotional decisions. Take a look at any successful company and their stock volatility over its lifetime, and you‚Äôll see MANY major dips. Folks who sold on those dips are probably filled with regret, but the Buffets of the world, who are dead inside, have reaped the rewards.\n\n*"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."* \n\n* Warren Buffett\n\n**And 100% Reason to Remember the Name (CLOVER HEALTH!)**\n\nLike I said before, I‚Äôm not here to talk about the short-mid term potential of CLOV $100+, but rather the long-term potential of CLOV $100+. If y‚Äôall have been following Chamath as I have, you‚Äôll know he\'s known for making conservative valuations. In 2018, he said Tesla would triple... it actually went 22.5x at its peak (currently at 15x). Whether you like the guy or not, he has a stellar track record. On top of that, he is one of the very few who stood with retail investors against market manipulation. This short-term volatility doesn‚Äôt deter me - I am long on this company, and will not sell my position for a measly 2-3x gain.\n\nI‚Äôll leave you with what I think is the most succinct outlook on Clover Health that‚Äôs been shared.\n\n*‚ÄúSo when you bring all of this forward and you think about the future, here‚Äôs what I see in a nutshell: Number one‚Ä¶ is a business that is actually delivering the promise of technology improving better outcomes and lowering costs in healthcare. Number two is a market that I think is huge and growing quickly. And number three is a business that is consistently taking share year over year over year. And so when you put all of these things together, in my opinion, this is one of the most straightforward investments I‚Äôve ever made. It‚Äôs a business that I think will become extremely valuable. It will build a lot of enterprise value, and will be what I think is going to be our next 10x in 10 years investment.‚Äù*\n\n* Chamath Palihapitiya'), ('CLOV is my next TSLA', 'CLOV is my next TSLA[removed]'), ('Time to consider $NNDM', 'Time to consider $NNDM&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Market Cap 2B\n\n\\-Cash on Hand: 1.4B and zero debt. \n\nCustomers: NEURALINK, NVDIA, SAMSUNG\n\n\\-ARKQ holding 7,664,620 shares\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f4j2bodjt571.png?width=2822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ee643b0bf1ede3c1fdec3998a29cf46b1d852d3\n\n\\-Revolutionizing Electronic Manufacturing\n\n\\-New Patent Awarded this week for: Double-sided and multilayered printed circuit board fabrication using inkjet printing\n\n[https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=11039541&amp;OS=11039541&amp;RS=11039541](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=11039541&amp;OS=11039541&amp;RS=11039541)\n\n\\-Recent Investor Presentation\n\n[https://www.nano-di.com/hubfs/2021-06-03-NNDM%20Corporate%20Presentation-final.pdf](https://www.nano-di.com/hubfs/2021-06-03-NNDM%20Corporate%20Presentation-final.pdf)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-Case Study\n\n[https://www.nano-di.com/rf\\_case\\_study\\_uts\\_1](https://www.nano-di.com/rf_case_study_uts_1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqcfxh5gjt571.png?width=530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87b5ecaf8389fbb4c714e610a200992d7d76b08f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ri59j81hjt571.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73259585d27128ce92b8646e449f668ecf52a354\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztyh0xthjt571.png?width=317&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47d0c2223598e255674d1dca591ee1501db37718\n\n* DeepCube (which was acquired by NNDM recently) has AMD as their customer\n* NanoFabrica - acquired by NNDM recently\n* Pretty much every single institution has their avg. share prices around $8.50 or more.

Now imagine them working for 17 years on something before any other company even thinks to start competing.  This is a bigger moat than many darlings of the tech world have in their software, such as TSLA, which had google, apple, etc. working on competing solutions for years.  And it has saved it\'s clients MILLIONS in Skywise.  For anyone in the software space; you know how brutal implementation is for SAP and similar platforms.  Often it\'s unsuccessful and expensive.

Their margins aren\'t the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status, but they are landing $300M govt. deals (SOCOM) and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY.\n\nTheir revenue growth officially is about 30% per year.\n\nHowever, as all SAAS companies do, internally they have a goal/target of around 50% per year.  That is absolutely achievable, in fact a few large deals can accomplish this, AND MUCH MORE.  I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals (just ONE big deal would annihilate that number) and they have been offering their product for literally less than a year now...\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[With two Daddy\'s like this, what could go wrong?

Companies won\'t buy it.**\n\nSAP is horrible and it\'s implemented all the time, takes years to implement, costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement, and is often not successful.  It\'s actually a running joke in the enterprise software world.  Palantir has a history of successful implementations (it\'s custom but designed so low-code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise), a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity (lul).  **This is like a SMART salesforce, which by the way, was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth $400B now, and it has competition in the CRM space.  PLTR is the next evolution, and has ZERO competition.**\n\nSalesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise. \xa0Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your ‚Äúsky net‚Äù and tell you what to do. \xa0It literally is that incredible. \xa0It‚Äôs true mass available prescriptive analytics, sprinkled across an entire company.\n\n**Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms, has no competition, and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2.

What history you ask? US Steel stock peaked exactly 13 years ago in June 2008, along with many other steel stocks, then proceeded to fall off a cliff due to the 2008 financial crisis stemming from overleveraged greedy ass wall street banks getting defaults on their mortgage gambles. This was amplified by the fact that steel production was at 90% capacity for these companies all jumping in to take advantage of the bubble that had formed, raising HRC prices to then-All-Time-High of \\~$1000. Needless to say, steel tanked after and they learned their lesson. You can bet your ass they won\'t let that happen again to remain ridiculously profitable post-inflation.\n\n[June 2 HRC futures](https://preview.redd.it/r1n6lg7aot571.png?width=1119&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0255d98e0605d606a8c0351807171207c462a523)\n\n[June 16 HRC futures](https://preview.redd.it/chssf8zaot571.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=540de73dc1d96c289718f1bdf51f815d3abb59e4)\n\nAbove are the HRC prices of June 2nd, followed by yesterday June 16. Steel stocks ran up to $200 when HRC prices rose to then-all-time-high of $1000 in 2008, and said stocks like $X are sitting at $25.75 now when HRC prices are at a NEW ALL TIME HIGHs of $1700 in 2021. It ain\'t exactly the same scenarios, but I\'m bullish and there\'s room to run on the stock.\n\nSteel stocks have run \\~100-200% depending since Covid/March 2020.

He knows.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Technicals** \\- Here\'s some charting back 9 months on $X and $CLF (orange line) compared - **From the technicals, my findings are as follows:**\n\n[X and CLF compared charts, 9 months](https://preview.redd.it/am3d7uhgot571.png?width=1360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8405aef585e9cbd68f46980d0f24a7904c069a05)\n\n* CLF shares historically trade below X by \\~$2-$4. This changed in February 2021, circled in chart as #1, due to X offering 42 million shares to the public, increasing the float up to \\~250m shares. I thought this would be the turning point for CLF but investors gobbled it up and the dip was short-lived.\n* This told me X is gonna X no matter what, it\'s the United Steel States Corporation founded by J.P Morgan himself among others. Even with ZERO recent hype while $CLF has WSB eyes for a week, you can see that X moved parallel (as steel should) to CLF, and maintains the lead. That will continue. CLF goes up, X will rise harder. More upside.\n* **2** indicates the run-up pre/post earnings. Most steel companies report earnings at a similar time. CLF will be the next one in mid-July. Imagine steel companies continue trading sideways while their predominant steel product in HRCs rise to new ATH\'s in a recovery summer with infrastructure plans on the horizon and severe supply shortages. Can\'t? Me neither. Pleas fly again.\n* **3** leading up to 4 in yellow circles are the market pullbacks in May, triggered by worse-than-expected CPI report. Remember last month? PLTR bled all the way down to $16, digital currency took a massive 50% hit from ATH, and Cathie Wood was no longer giving you wet dreams. But X steel? 24% dip down to $23.40 level, bought up immediately again within the week. Now, chilling on the resistance.\n* **4** is resistance. Even on bloody days, X refuses to dip below \\~$25.75 and $25.40. It\'s there right now as I type. Apart from that bloodbath in May, X does not dip below that channel in the two-month chart. Yesterday, it hit this mark again - market bled and X hit this resistance for the 10th time in 2 months. And I am about $35k USD certain that it\'s ready to bounce to a new high. Inflation is real, so where does money go? Hold cash and lose money? Lol, no. "Guarantees". Bonds/Trusts. Cyclicals. Companies that make money. X is going to make some damn money this year. Where does JP Morgan want to put their $500 billion?([https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-stockpiled-500-bln-cash-prepare-higher-inflation-2021-6-1030522253](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-stockpiled-500-bln-cash-prepare-higher-inflation-2021-6-1030522253)) "Steel is a generational opportunity" their words.\n* X had lower earnings during the pandemic compared to CLF, but reported higher earnings (Adjusted EBITDA / EPS) in Q1 2021. As X has higher margins, assets and debt overall, US steel has a lot more room for recovery/growth than other steel stocks, which it is primed to obtain AND beyond at this rate. The Return of the King is in the works.\n* X has dividends. It\'s small, but a company to post one of their most profitable years in history with raised guidance after a shares offering will likely return something to shareholders. RKT special $1 dividend? Torchlight Energy special preferred A dividend share? Not sure. Expecting something on this front towards their earnings next month however.\n* Price targets by analysts don\'t matter and often, I\'m more tempted to sell than buy depending on the coverage. But JP Morgan along with other banks are hoarding literal billions in cash due to QE, inflation and low rates, and they won\'t sit on it for long, they\'re going to buy in, if not already. They are smart money after all. Here are the price targets for $X.\n\n\\-Credit Suisse - $35 May 4\n\n\\-Morgan Stanley - $32 May 17\n\n\\-UBS Group - $30 June 4\n\n\\-JP Morgan - $41 June 16 (yesterday)\n\n\\-Goldman Sachs - $25 April 9 - this is outdated and will update by end of this month probably. No way we see below $30 in July IMHO.\n\n* Thus, upside potential is higher for X. Among American steel stocks like $CMC, $NUE, $SCHN, $STLD, $CLF, and $X, US steel ran the least Year-to-Date (+50.51%). X steel also had the highest of highs among Steel stocks in \'08.\n\n[Steel Armageddon \'08](https://preview.redd.it/hlvyxzxoot571.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fbc5f50b75d14f677e2a0c8c10a4d67654a4d65)\n\n**But honestly, fundamentals mean shit and this is a casino. So here are two main reasons why I like $X.**\n\n**1. Market Capitalization:** X\'s market cap is one of lowest among steelmakers. Their float at \\~260m shares is half of \\~500m in $CLF and other stocks like $WISH, $AMC, $BB, so on. Market cap is the biggest reason why we likely will never see something like $GME again. Before last week, CLF\'s daily volume of \\~18m(4% float) was lower than X\'s volume of \\~21m(9% float), despite having double the available shares. X moves more swiftly and momentously than you can expect of this boomer. I imagine X\'s volume to üöÄüöÄ heading into July without a doubt. They are THE United States Steel after all, soon to post historical earnings in a commodity boom.\n\n**\\*\\*2. The United States Steel Corporation. US Steel. Ticker -X-.\\*\\*** Fucking X.

Their margins aren\'t the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status, but they are landing $300M govt. deals (SOCOM) and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY.\n\nTheir revenue growth officially is about 30% per year.\n\nHowever, as all SAAS companies do, internally they have a goal/target of around 50% per year.  That is absolutely achievable, in fact a few large deals can accomplish this, AND MUCH MORE.  I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals (just ONE big deal would annihilate that number) and they have been offering their product for literally less than a year now...\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[With two Daddy\'s like this, what could go wrong?  Why is PLTR hated by the media?](https://preview.redd.it/wuid619x4r571.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=998b2feb59674afacc6dad5b7217cbde56e98e0c)\n\n**FUD:  What could go wrong, why has the stock dropped after it\'s meteoric rise?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **It\'s custom software! That\'s expensive, time consuming, hard to scale!  Companies won\'t buy it.**\n\nSAP is horrible and it\'s implemented all the time, takes years to implement, costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement, and is often not successful.  It\'s actually a running joke in the enterprise software world.  Palantir has a history of successful implementations (it\'s custom but designed so low-code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise), a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity (lul).  **This is like a SMART salesforce, which by the way, was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth $400B now, and it has competition in the CRM space.  PLTR is the next evolution, and has ZERO competition.**\n\nSalesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise. \xa0Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your ‚Äúsky net‚Äù and tell you what to do. \xa0It literally is that incredible. \xa0It‚Äôs true mass available prescriptive analytics, sprinkled across an entire company.\n\n**Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms, has no competition, and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2.   Daddy Karp made the most of any CEO this year and he sold hundreds of millions of shares!**\n\nThe way he is paid, his Stock granted is income.  So he pays TAXES on it.  That means he has to sell shares just to cover the taxes so he doesn\'t go to federal prison.  The dude can\'t pay it any other way he doesn\'t have hundreds of millions of dollars laying around...he\'s spent 17 years building this as his baby.  This is all stupid media FUD because it makes awesome headlines and scares the shit out of boomers that aren\'t used to the financing around an insanely fast growing software company.  The numbers look crazy on the surface but make sense once you realize it\'s all because of the meteoric rise in the stock price.\n\n**3.  They are compensating their employees with Stock! It Dilutes us!**\n\nThey are hiring the worlds best software engineer PHD Data Scientists to make sure their moat and monopoly doesn\'t even come close to being encroached on.  These people are expensive.  They continually train their models in their client\'s environments, without keeping their clients data, only evolving their own model.  This maintains privacy and creates momentum for their algorithm that makes it impossible to catch up to PLTR\'s Foundry.  Think google with their threatgraph for search.  They have too much data and too much time refining their algorithms for anyone to catch them in that category.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Price Targets:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Holy Fucking Shit, look at that Q1 rev. growth despite being brand new to enterprise...](https://preview.redd.it/rkgyuszcuq571.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14ea1be3ff5dbdbadd731a7ae8a69d94fcabe713)\n\nIf they grow at the internal, non-sandbagged rate they think they will hit **according to internal docs shared with public (google Q4 2020 PLTR business update, can\'t link).**\n\nThey will have $4B in revenue, in 4 years.  Imagine in 4 years, if a SAAS company was priced at just 10x Revenue with 50% + growth yoy....which will accelerate as proof of concept is demonstrated at large orgs.\n\n**My price target is $80 EOY** because I believe at least one HUGE contract will roll in that will provide further proof of FOUNDRY as a concept and the impact will be undeniable.  Companies will be lining up to get Foundry and projected demand will show implied growth off the charts that no one has accounted for.  The Skywise project finalized my opinion on this, PLTR told them WHEN VALVES IN ENGINES WERE BEHAVING ODDLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO FAILURE, OPTIMALLY, TO SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR PER AIRLINE IN SCHEDULING AND OTHER COSTS you can read about that on another subreddit, the info is out there if you do a google search on skywise.\n\n**Price target in 4 years: $500.  1. its Cathy Bae\'s Number(not for that time period)**, but also because I think revenue growth will be more like salesforce was as a necessary platform to enterprises.  This would give it a larger MKT cap than Salesforce.  **If this becomes a hyped meme to add fueld to the fire, it will accelerate beyond what we can even comprehend, TESLA style.

What history you ask? US Steel stock peaked exactly 13 years ago in June 2008, along with many other steel stocks, then proceeded to fall off a cliff due to the 2008 financial crisis stemming from overleveraged greedy ass wall street banks getting defaults on their mortgage gambles. This was amplified by the fact that steel production was at 90% capacity for these companies all jumping in to take advantage of the bubble that had formed, raising HRC prices to then-All-Time-High of \\~$1000. Needless to say, steel tanked after and they learned their lesson. You can bet your ass they won\'t let that happen again to remain ridiculously profitable post-inflation.\n\n[June 2 HRC futures](https://preview.redd.it/r1n6lg7aot571.png?width=1119&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0255d98e0605d606a8c0351807171207c462a523)\n\n[June 16 HRC futures](https://preview.redd.it/chssf8zaot571.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=540de73dc1d96c289718f1bdf51f815d3abb59e4)\n\nAbove are the HRC prices of June 2nd, followed by yesterday June 16. Steel stocks ran up to $200 when HRC prices rose to then-all-time-high of $1000 in 2008, and said stocks like $X are sitting at $25.75 now when HRC prices are at a NEW ALL TIME HIGHs of $1700 in 2021. It ain\'t exactly the same scenarios, but I\'m bullish and there\'s room to run on the stock.\n\nSteel stocks have run \\~100-200% depending since Covid/March 2020.

This changed in February 2021, circled in chart as #1, due to X offering 42 million shares to the public, increasing the float up to \\~250m shares. I thought this would be the turning point for CLF but investors gobbled it up and the dip was short-lived.\n* This told me X is gonna X no matter what, it\'s the United Steel States Corporation founded by J.P Morgan himself among others. Even with ZERO recent hype while $CLF has WSB eyes for a week, you can see that X moved parallel (as steel should) to CLF, and maintains the lead. That will continue. CLF goes up, X will rise harder. More upside.\n* **2** indicates the run-up pre/post earnings. Most steel companies report earnings at a similar time. CLF will be the next one in mid-July. Imagine steel companies continue trading sideways while their predominant steel product in HRCs rise to new ATH\'s in a recovery summer with infrastructure plans on the horizon and severe supply shortages. Can\'t? Me neither. Pleas fly again.\n* **3** leading up to 4 in yellow circles are the market pullbacks in May, triggered by worse-than-expected CPI report. Remember last month? PLTR bled all the way down to $16, digital currency took a massive 50% hit from ATH, and Cathie Wood was no longer giving you wet dreams. But X steel? 24% dip down to $23.40 level, bought up immediately again within the week. Now, chilling on the resistance.\n* **4** is resistance. Even on bloody days, X refuses to dip below \\~$25.75 and $25.40. It\'s there right now as I type. Apart from that bloodbath in May, X does not dip below that channel in the two-month chart. Yesterday, it hit this mark again - market bled and X hit this resistance for the 10th time in 2 months. And I am about $35k USD certain that it\'s ready to bounce to a new high. Inflation is real, so where does money go? Hold cash and lose money? Lol, no. "Guarantees". Bonds/Trusts. Cyclicals. Companies that make money. X is going to make some damn money this year. Where does JP Morgan want to put their $500 billion?([https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-stockpiled-500-bln-cash-prepare-higher-inflation-2021-6-1030522253](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jpmorgan-jamie-dimon-stockpiled-500-bln-cash-prepare-higher-inflation-2021-6-1030522253)) "Steel is a generational opportunity" their words.\n* X had lower earnings during the pandemic compared to CLF, but reported higher earnings (Adjusted EBITDA / EPS) in Q1 2021. As X has higher margins, assets and debt overall, US steel has a lot more room for recovery/growth than other steel stocks, which it is primed to obtain AND beyond at this rate. The Return of the King is in the works.\n* X has dividends. It\'s small, but a company to post one of their most profitable years in history with raised guidance after a shares offering will likely return something to shareholders. RKT special $1 dividend? Torchlight Energy special preferred A dividend share? Not sure. Expecting something on this front towards their earnings next month however.\n* Price targets by analysts don\'t matter and often, I\'m more tempted to sell than buy depending on the coverage. But JP Morgan along with other banks are hoarding literal billions in cash due to QE, inflation and low rates, and they won\'t sit on it for long, they\'re going to buy in, if not already. They are smart money after all. Here are the price targets for $X.\n\n\\-Credit Suisse - $35 May 4\n\n\\-Morgan Stanley - $32 May 17\n\n\\-UBS Group - $30 June 4\n\n\\-JP Morgan - $41 June 16 (yesterday)\n\n\\-Goldman Sachs - $25 April 9 - this is outdated and will update by end of this month probably. No way we see below $30 in July IMHO.\n\n* Thus, upside potential is higher for X. Among American steel stocks like $CMC, $NUE, $SCHN, $STLD, $CLF, and $X, US steel ran the least Year-to-Date (+50.51%). X steel also had the highest of highs among Steel stocks in \'08.\n\n[Steel Armageddon \'08](https://preview.redd.it/hlvyxzxoot571.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fbc5f50b75d14f677e2a0c8c10a4d67654a4d65)\n\n**But honestly, fundamentals mean shit and this is a casino. So here are two main reasons why I like $X.**\n\n**1. Market Capitalization:** X\'s market cap is one of lowest among steelmakers. Their float at \\~260m shares is half of \\~500m in $CLF and other stocks like $WISH, $AMC, $BB, so on. Market cap is the biggest reason why we likely will never see something like $GME again. Before last week, CLF\'s daily volume of \\~18m(4% float) was lower than X\'s volume of \\~21m(9% float), despite having double the available shares. X moves more swiftly and momentously than you can expect of this boomer. I imagine X\'s volume to üöÄüöÄ heading into July without a doubt.

In-fact, Peter Thiel himself has a book and has given speeches on the power of moats and "not competing, but forming a monopoly."  Zero to One.\n\n**So why all this info?  It\'s critical to understand the facts I am about to present to you.**\n\nWith a ton of hype, and plenty of meme power, PLTR rose to past $40 a share earlier this year.\n\nMost if not all did not truly understand how special the technology was, and it fell on FUD surrounding stock based compensation and Daddy Karp selling shares.  We will get to this FUD at the end.\n\nW**hy it\'s special:**\n\n**MOAT:  I see people say, "it\'s just data analytics, anyone can compete with them." no.**\n\nThis is like people saying, "it\'s just an airplane copy it and it should fly great."  An analytics platform that is able to "gameify" real world problems in real time and present solutions using integrated Ai/ML is a MASSIVE engineering problem.  Think, a ton of PHD level skilled engineers making the highest salaries in Tech.  So much, that they can retire after a few years if they want.  Now imagine them working for 17 years on something before any other company even thinks to start competing.  This is a bigger moat than many darlings of the tech world have in their software, such as TSLA, which had google, apple, etc. working on competing solutions for years.  And it has saved it\'s clients MILLIONS in Skywise.  For anyone in the software space; you know how brutal implementation is for SAP and similar platforms.  Often it\'s unsuccessful and expensive.  PLTR is already demonstrating PROFITABLE implementations.  This is a sign of a massive moat for anyone who understands the enterprise software world.\n\n[This is just a summary of one application of PLTR\'s Skywise platform; built on Foundry.

Their margins aren\'t the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status, but they are landing $300M govt. deals (SOCOM) and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY.\n\nTheir revenue growth officially is about 30% per year.\n\nHowever, as all SAAS companies do, internally they have a goal/target of around 50% per year.  That is absolutely achievable, in fact a few large deals can accomplish this, AND MUCH MORE.  I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals (just ONE big deal would annihilate that number) and they have been offering their product for literally less than a year now...\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[With two Daddy\'s like this, what could go wrong?

That\'s expensive, time consuming, hard to scale!  Companies won\'t buy it.**\n\nSAP is horrible and it\'s implemented all the time, takes years to implement, costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement, and is often not successful.  It\'s actually a running joke in the enterprise software world.  Palantir has a history of successful implementations (it\'s custom but designed so low-code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise), a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity (lul).  **This is like a SMART salesforce, which by the way, was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth $400B now, and it has competition in the CRM space.  PLTR is the next evolution, and has ZERO competition.**\n\nSalesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise. \xa0Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your ‚Äúsky net‚Äù and tell you what to do. \xa0It literally is that incredible. \xa0It‚Äôs true mass available prescriptive analytics, sprinkled across an entire company.\n\n**Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms, has no competition, and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2.   Daddy Karp made the most of any CEO this year and he sold hundreds of millions of shares!**\n\nThe way he is paid, his Stock granted is income.  So he pays TAXES on it.  That means he has to sell shares just to cover the taxes so he doesn\'t go to federal prison.  The dude can\'t pay it any other way he doesn\'t have hundreds of millions of dollars laying around...he\'s spent 17 years building this as his baby.  This is all stupid media FUD because it makes awesome headlines and scares the shit out of boomers that aren\'t used to the financing around an insanely fast growing software company.  The numbers look crazy on the surface but make sense once you realize it\'s all because of the meteoric rise in the stock price.\n\n**3.  They are compensating their employees with Stock! It Dilutes us!**\n\nThey are hiring the worlds best software engineer PHD Data Scientists to make sure their moat and monopoly doesn\'t even come close to being encroached on.  These people are expensive.  They continually train their models in their client\'s environments, without keeping their clients data, only evolving their own model.  This maintains privacy and creates momentum for their algorithm that makes it impossible to catch up to PLTR\'s Foundry.  Think google with their threatgraph for search.  They have too much data and too much time refining their algorithms for anyone to catch them in that category.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Price Targets:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Holy Fucking Shit, look at that Q1 rev. growth despite being brand new to enterprise...](https://preview.redd.it/rkgyuszcuq571.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14ea1be3ff5dbdbadd731a7ae8a69d94fcabe713)\n\nIf they grow at the internal, non-sandbagged rate they think they will hit **according to internal docs shared with public (google Q4 2020 PLTR business update, can\'t link).**\n\nThey will have $4B in revenue, in 4 years.  Imagine in 4 years, if a SAAS company was priced at just 10x Revenue with 50% + growth yoy....which will accelerate as proof of concept is demonstrated at large orgs.\n\n**My price target is $80 EOY** because I believe at least one HUGE contract will roll in that will provide further proof of FOUNDRY as a concept and the impact will be undeniable.  Companies will be lining up to get Foundry and projected demand will show implied growth off the charts that no one has accounted for.  The Skywise project finalized my opinion on this, PLTR told them WHEN VALVES IN ENGINES WERE BEHAVING ODDLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO FAILURE, OPTIMALLY, TO SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR PER AIRLINE IN SCHEDULING AND OTHER COSTS you can read about that on another subreddit, the info is out there if you do a google search on skywise.\n\n**Price target in 4 years: $500.  1. its Cathy Bae\'s Number(not for that time period)**, but also because I think revenue growth will be more like salesforce was as a necessary platform to enterprises.

However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gd2ixiclhz571.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755c06a09499b39b429a492e67190e41478d5372\n\nHe tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1.

There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blo3ms45iz571.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dbbf2cc89dcd10a9a04460c47c221f67ab92f99\n\nBesides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.\n\nWhile this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to "Elon Musk, the 2nd" which could be referring to the second stock split.\n\nFurthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bw87j61djz571.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbd74f28b426161b14ac8854c257a12e030564f4\n\nHe could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.\n\nAssuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 21st, 2021.\n\n# **The Fed will continue to dominate the market in the week ahead after sell-off - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/the-fed-will-continue-to-dominate-the-market-in-the-week-ahead-after-sell-off.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve‚Äôs signal that it is looking to step away from some of its easy policy is expected to be a dominant trading theme in the week ahead and likely for the rest of the summer.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, investors repositioned across the financial markets after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank was considering tapering its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage securities. That is important since when the Fed eventually acts, it would be the first serious reversal of the easy policies it put in place to add liquidity to markets when the economy shut down last year because of the Covid crisis.\n*****\n&gt; The purchases, which amount to $120 billion a month, would be gradually whittled away once the Fed decides to slow down and end the bond buying, or quantitative easing. That could then open the door to interest rate hikes, which the Fed now projects would come in 2023.\n*****\n&gt; The Federal Reserve sent ripples across financial markets after its meeting Wednesday. The dollar jumped, stocks fell and bond yields moved to imply higher short-term interest rates in the future. The Dow fell 3.5%, its worst week since October. The S&amp;P 500 was down 1.9% for the week, its worst weekly loss since February, and the Nasdaq lost just 0.3%, helped by a small weekly gain in tech.\n*****\n&gt; ‚ÄúI think the market is still digesting the Fed meeting,‚Äù said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. Stocks were trading sharply lower Friday, after weakness Wednesday and Thursday. Yields fell on longer duration bonds, like the benchmark 10-year, but rose on the shorter duration 2- and 5-year notes.\n*****\n&gt; The spreads between those shorter-duration notes and the 10- and 30-year bond yields narrowed dramatically in a so-called flattening trade. That‚Äôs common when interest rates are rising. The higher short rates reflect the expected increases in the fed funds rate, while the longer duration yields fall, because the thinking historically has been that a tightening Fed slows the economy.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also provided new economic forecasts, including a chart on interest rates that shows it expects to hike its fed funds rate twice in 2023, after its prior forecast included no increases.\n*****\n&gt; Fed speakers will get a lot of attention in the week ahead. Powell speaks Tuesday before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on the Fed‚Äôs policy response and the economy. His remarks could be a highlight of what looks to be a slow, but volatile first week of summer for markets.\n*****\n&gt; There are a number of other Fed officials speaking, including New York Fed President John Williams on Monday and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, both Tuesday. Other Fed speakers include Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.\n*****\n&gt; ‚ÄúGetting more color from others will certainly be key,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Global Advisors. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm most interested certainly in what Powell has to say. They‚Äôre all going to give us now the fine print of what was in the statement and what Powell said‚Äù at the end of the Fed‚Äôs June meeting.\n*****\n&gt; There should be a lot of interest in personal consumption expenditures data next Friday, since it includes the PCE inflation index, closely watched by the Fed. The Fed has been pressing its view that elevated inflation readings are just temporary and that they should calm down next year.\n*****\n&gt; Boockvar said the inflation data should reflect the same spike in prices that showed up in the consumer price index for May, up 5% year over year.\n*****\n&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to show some pretty robust month-over-month increases,‚Äù said Boockvar. He said inflation data will be the most important for markets.\n*****\n&gt; ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the rest of the year is all about ‚Äî inflation, inflation, inflation and how does the Federal Reserve adjust to that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn this inflation debate, it‚Äôs not just a U.S. thing, it‚Äôs a global thing.‚Äù\n*****\n&gt; While the Fed has now penciled in two interest rate hikes for 2023, the market is more skeptical about inflation. According to futures markets, investors believe there could be one or more rate hikes next year and at least four in total before the end of 2023.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed forecast 3.4% PCE inflation for this year, up a full point from its March forecast, but it still expects a tame 2.1% pace next year.\n*****\n&gt; Housing data will also be of big interest to markets, after the Fed‚Äôs tiny step forward toward tightening unleased a surge in mortgage rates.\n*****\n&gt; The rate for the 30-year fixed loan jumped to 3.25% by Thursday, the highest in months, according to Mortgage News Daily. The Fed is currently purchasing about $40 billion a month in mortgage securities, and that would slow down along with Treasury buying.\n*****\n&gt; Existing home sales are released Tuesday, and new home sales are reported Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; # Value versus growth\n&gt; Keon said the market is choppy but taking in stride the change in the Fed. He said he has overweight stocks in his portfolios. ‚ÄúWe like that position with earnings likely to grow 40% this year, rates staying pretty low. That‚Äôs a good environment for stocks,‚Äù he said.\n*****\n&gt; As the market traded lower this past week, tech and some growth names held their ground. Tech was barely positive, registering a nearly 0.1% gain for the week. The worst performing sectors were in the value space ‚Äî commodities-related or part of the reopening cyclical trade.\n*****\n&gt; Materials were down 6.3% for the week, and financials were down more than 6% as a flattening yield curve has the potential to hurt bank profits.\n*****\n&gt; ‚ÄúWe had a very good move for value stocks and for the reopening plays. They really did well for six months or so,‚Äù said Keon. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing in the market that keeps going forever. This is probably a bit of a counter rotation. Whether it‚Äôs the beginning of a major shift or a slight bounce back [for tech], is hard to say and rates are going to be a determinant.‚Äù\n*****\n&gt; Keon said if the closely watched 10-year yield goes to 2% from its current 1.5%, that would be a positive for value stocks. But if it stays anchored around 1.5%, tech could continue to do well.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year yield, which is the benchmark Treasury, fluctuated widely in the past week. After starting the week at about 1.45%, it moved higher right after the Fed meeting to as high as 1.59% but then fell back down to about 1.44% Friday afternoon.\n*****\n&gt; The 2-year note yielded 0.256% on Friday, up sharply from the prior week‚Äôs Friday close of 0.149%.\n*****\n&gt; ‚ÄúMy guess is that the thinking is that at the press conference, Powell made it pretty clear he has no intention of raising rates until 2023,‚Äù said Keon. ‚ÄúUntil you get to 2023, you‚Äôre going to get the boom we are in now, and you‚Äôre going to get pretty strong growth in 2022. By the time, you get to 2023, the economy is going to be slowing and is the Fed going to raise rates in a slowing economy? Probably not.‚Äù\n*****\n&gt; Keon said that would keep a cap on the size of the Fed rate hikes. He said there‚Äôs little chance the Fed will hike before 2023 unless there‚Äôs an upside surprise in inflation.\n*****\n&gt; ‚ÄúThe market thinks the Fed is not going to raise rates until 2023, absent an unexpected surprise to inflation, and that they‚Äôre not going to raise rates that much in 2023 because they‚Äôll be risking a recession,‚Äù he said.\n*****\n&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the Fed has now injected a new level of volatility into the markets. He expects investors will be on edge now as the Fed‚Äôs late July meeting approaches and again as the Fed heads to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in late August for its annual symposium.\n*****\n&gt; Many economists expect Jackson Hole to be the forum where the Fed releases details of the tapering program. Once the Fed announces it will cut back, it is then expected to wait a few months before slowly paring back the purchases over many months. The end of the easing program is important since it would then open the door to a potential rate hike, based on the strength of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; ‚ÄúThe narrative here is the markets are likely to continue going back and forth with regard to their view on the Fed assessment of whether transitory is correct or not,‚Äù Emanuel said. ‚ÄúTransitory‚Äù is how the Fed describes its view that the surge in inflation will be short-lived.\n*****\n&gt; In the past week, some of the inflationary pressure in the market dissipated with a major sell-off across the commodities complex. The Fed‚Äôs policy talk helped spur a surge in the dollar, which was part of the reason for the selling. But the first catalyst was a move by China to cool the hot commodities markets. Reuters reported that a Chinese government agency planned to release reserves of aluminum, copper and zinc.\n*****\n&gt; Copper was down more than 8.4% on the week, its worst week since March 2020.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/QeDvubB.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/c4mOFUy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/nfckMPA.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7H0ZZUf.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/JBlGnli.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OYV6vlW.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GCWxRIe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WstlP83.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xNqbPVY.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nyNirM8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IkwhPC6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/J7KAQ4b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/yEBCfYQ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Down Triple Witching Weeks Trigger More Weakness Week After\n\n&gt; As stocks continue to sell off on this Q2 Triple Witching Friday it is a good time to review the history and the pattern of down Triple Witching Weeks triggering more weakness the week after. This phenomenon is detailed on page 106 of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac page 2022. The updated table of the four annual DJIA TWWs is pictured here.\n\n&gt; The most important fact to note is that the week after TWW is the worst in Q2 ‚Äì down 26 of the past 30 years since 1991. Down TWWs not only trigger weakness the week after, but that trend is most pronounce in Q2 and Q3 ‚Äì the quarters within the Worst Six Months. Since 1991, of 39 down TWWs, 27 following weeks were also down. But in Q2 10 of the 12 down TWWs were followed by a down week after and it‚Äôs 11 of 12 in Q3.\n\n&gt; Proceed with caution next week. And Happy Father‚Äôs Day to all the dads!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/722621168e16fd8f0481b3814ac465a9/13339cd31fcce957-b1/s500x750/1fdc67c74f34e17bdc0587af331eda5a373860da.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Big Drops In The Percent of Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs\n\n&gt; In yesterday's Sector Snapshot, we highlighted how the internals of several sectors have weakened dramatically in recent days. One such measure in which there are drastic differences versus a couple of weeks ago is the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In the charts below, we show the changes in this reading across sectors and for the broader S&amp;P 500.\n\n&gt; As shown, the two sectors which have seen the largest share of their stocks fall below the support of their 50-DMAs are Financials and Materials. Two weeks ago, both of these sectors boasted some of the strongest readings of all sectors, but through yesterday, those readings have fallen over 60 percentage points. Meanwhile, Energy and Real Estate have seen almost all of their stocks trade above their 50-DMAs over the past two weeks without much change. While the declines were not as dramatic as Materials and Financials, Industrials and Consumer Staples have also seen a significant share of their members fall below their 50-DMAs. While most sectors have seen a decline in this reading, Tech and Health Care have been notable standouts with both sectors having more stocks above their 50-DMAs now than two weeks ago. This is indicative of the rotation that has been going on underneath the surface throughout the entire bull market that began when the S&amp;P made its 2020 low after the COVID Crash last March.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061821-50-DMA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Leading Indicators Continue to Forecast Growth\n\n&gt; As the economic focus has frantically shifted from inflation concerns to peak growth fears to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) tightening timeline in recent weeks, it can be helpful to take a step back and assess the broad economic trend with a diversified set of indicators.\n\n&gt; Through this lens, we are encouraged by the latest reading of the Leading Economic Index (LEI), which strongly suggested that economic growth would continue at a strong clip in the near-to-intermediate term.\n\n&gt; On Thursday, June 17, the Conference Board released its May 2021 report detailing the latest datapoint for the LEI, a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special attention to the LEI, as it has a forward-looking tilt to it and spans many segments of the economy. The index grew 1.3% month over month, building on the strength seen in recent months since flirting with negative territory in February.\n\n&gt; ‚ÄúThree consecutive monthly gains in excess of 1% tend to be rare, and in fact, we never experienced that coming out of the 2008 recession,‚Äù said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThat we have seen this dynamic twice now exiting the trough of the most recent recession speaks to the speed and strength of the recovery. We certainly understand near-term jitters, but we expect broader economic trends to remain positive over the intermediate term, consistent with the LEI‚Äôs message.‚Äù\n\n&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI has shown strong growth the last three months after limping through the second half of winter.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.18.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**\n\n&gt; Seven of the ten components grew in May, while two fell and one remained unchanged. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread represented the three largest contributors. Building permits and manufacturers‚Äô new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft detracted from the overall index‚Äôs performance, while average weekly manufacturing hours held steady.\n\n&gt; Strong breadth among the underlying components reinforces our view of continued economic strength. While supply chain bottlenecks and a slower-than-desired labor market recovery have acted as near term speedbumps, we expect those dynamics to largely self-correct and propel the economy further in the second half of the year. Reopening effects are snowballing, and we believe ever-increasing vaccination numbers, warmer weather, and the potential for strong employment growth later in 2021 warrant continued optimism for this economy.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Citi Surprise Indices Surging But Not Everywhere\n\n&gt; It is a boring start to the week with nothing on the docket for earnings, Fed speakers, or economic data. With regards to the latter, the slate will pick up tomorrow with several US releases including retail sales, PPI, industrial production, and more. Expectations for tomorrow's releases are a bit mixed relative to the prior readings in each indicator, but overall, recent US data has been beating expectations at a healthy rate. The charts below show the Citi Economic Surprise indices for a variety of global regions and the US. Positive readings in these indices indicate economic data is coming in above forecasts, and vice versa for negative readings. Additionally, higher positive or negative readings would mean that economic data is exceeding or coming up short of those forecasts by a wider margin.\n\n&gt; Currently, the US index is well off record levels from the past year, but it has bounced since the start of June. The index has risen 42.7 points in the ten days from the end of May to last Friday. That move stands in the top 2% of all 10-day changes since the index began in 2003. That also comes not even a full month after the index saw its first negative reading in a year. While the negative reading was far from anything extreme, the sharp rebound has been impressive, leaving the index at a historically healthy level in the 83rd percentile.\n\n&gt; The US is not alone in having seen a rebound. Although it is similarly off the peak from last summer and generally trending lower since then, the global index has consistently sat at the high end of its historical range over the past year. The current reading is still in the top 1% of all periods, and the move higher over the past ten days is again dramatic ranking in the top 5% of ten-day changes in the index's history. While the jump in the US index has likely played at least some part in this, other regions around the world are also pulling weight having seen just as, if not more, significant moves. Sticking with a look at the move over the past ten days, the gains for the indices covering APAC and Central/Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa all rank in the 98th percentile while the move in the index tracking Latin American countries ranks in the top decile. Each of these indices now sits in the top 1% or 2% of their historical ranges. One outlier region not contributing to the pickup in the global index has been Europe. While the Eurozone index is far from weak, it has not seen much of a move higher recently as other regions have.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061421-CESI-Regions.png))**\n\n&gt; Likely thanks to the weakness in Eurozone countries, a similar dichotomy can be seen comparing the indices for major developed economies (the G10 members) and emerging market countries. While the index tracking major economies has simply held up at healthy levels, the emerging markets index has leaped to new record highs, breaking well above the previous records set earlier in the pandemic. BRIC countries in particular are some to thank for that sharp move higher as the index has seen one of its largest short-term moves on record.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061421-CESI-EM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # June Quarterly Options Expiration Week and After Historically Volatile\n\n&gt; The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last eighteen years, but down five of the last six.\n\n&gt; Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 27 of the last 31 years with an average performance of ‚Äì1.14%. S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 31-year span, declining 0.79% and 0.29% respectively on average.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/141a2a5cc757b0258359ef263f470d91/40704b63ac1ec12f-d2/s500x750/ee86f4713788c515bd122988f5c985ef05532feb.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9d41367baa02618174dc7702572999ad/40704b63ac1ec12f-25/s500x750/111c5f72fa726e8c8a34ba1f7c4c85b920df1064.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f92b0fab413284d3f5b71c9e6ebffef5/40704b63ac1ec12f-6e/s500x750/d8a03a5d3da450d13a7a4d98acea5011e421aa94.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # Sentiment Shaky\n\n&gt; Although there has not been any sort of dramatic breakout to the upside as the index has fallen over the past few days, the S&amp;P 500 did manage to tag new record highs in the past week for the first time since May 10th. The record-high milestone has done little to shift sentiment though. The AAII survey of individual investor sentiment saw its reading on bullish sentiment rise 0.9 percentage points to 41.1%. While higher, that is still three points below the reading from just a couple of weeks ago.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n&gt; The biggest move was in neutral sentiment as that reading fell 6.4 percentage points to 32.7%. That is the lowest reading in over a month and marked the biggest drop in neutral sentiment since the week of April 8th. Even though that was a big drop, neutral sentiment remains slightly elevated versus the historical average (31.42%) and especially relative to what has been the norm over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Neut.png))**\n\n&gt; The past couple of weeks have seen historically muted readings on bearish sentiment. While that is still the case with this week's readings remaining at the low end of its historical range, bearish sentiment saw a big 5.5 percentage point gain rising to 26.2%. That one-week uptick in bearish sentiment was the largest since last September. It also marked the first time since the end of last month that over a quarter of respondents reported as bearish. While the move was not nearly as large, the Investors Intelligence survey echoed that increase in bearish sentiment with the bull-bear spread in that survey falling from 38.3 to 37.8 after inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment.

Am I stupid?So I took positions against SPY today (and against the DOW, A/K/A "Boomer SPY") because I noticed what I thought to be a divergence between the movement of the market and the underlying indicators.\n\nFrom April 23 to June 17th/18th we can see the following:\n\nThe price of SPY has increased slightly.\n\nThe MACD has formed two bear crosses. Importantly: the second cross is at a lower point than the first cross, and thus it diverges with the underlying direction of the stock price (which is positive).\n\nThe RSI is also at a lower point on June 17th than it was on Aril 23, despite the underlying price going up.\n\nBelow is everything I\'ve described thus far summed up in a doodle:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vabpwvs9s3671.jpg?width=1108&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bbdc21acb8bf33d5b1245b33d68e7d63cc73040\n\nGenerally, when you see the indicators moving in a bearish direction while the stock is moving in a bullish direction it can be an indication that the stock price may reverse. This is also known as a divergence.\n\nAnother bearish indicator can be when a candle closes below a moving average. Swing traders tend to look at the 9 day and 50 day moving averages for confirmation of whether to enter or exit positions. Here, we can we can see a full candle close below the 9-day MA on 6/17 and a full close below the 50-day on 6/18. I think this is pretty significant because these candle closes formed right after the lower RSI/MACD figures.\n\nFor full disclosure I have positions in SPXS (which is a 3X inverse SPY ETF) and SDOW (which is a 3X inverse DOW ETF). I think we may see a continued reversal into next week based on this information and I\'m posting this because I\'m curious if other people are taking similar positions, or at least selling positions in anticipation of a reversal?\n\nAlso this is not financial advice. Nothing on this sub is financial advice.\n\nAnd yes, I do have a beard.'), ('Guys SPY usually recovers within a month right?', 'Guys SPY usually recovers within a month right?'), ("Wallstreet Hold'em ODDS: Reverse Repo, Inflation, Interest Hikes.", "Wallstreet Hold'em ODDS: Reverse Repo, Inflation, Interest Hikes.Everyone loves money and the casino is shutting off some games.\n\n**Key words to understand:**\n\n**Inflation-** Things cost more, the purchasing power of the dollar is less. You probably already notice that  materials have cost more. Inflation as mentioned by the FEDs is temporary and here to stay, for now. Think materials like stock, people hoard, lack of supply, lumber hits $1000 per 1000 ft. The overestimated inflation is now coming back to to find a midpoint. Because inflation is here we need to take a look at the return on investments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!Inflation short term, it's already here! Commodities are dumping from being over inflated. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Interest Hike** \\- Everyone is talking about whether or not JPOW is going to raise interest rates to counter inflation. By raising rates you would make people spend less because you get more of a return from savings than spending. If people spend less, then demand goes and deflation will occur.\n\n&gt;!Interest rate hikes adjust from 2024 to 2023. More inflation?! Possibly, but the 5 year yields are going up and the 30 year yields are going down. More return on investments for 5 year vs 30 year. What does this mean?! Borrowing short term money will cost you more than borrowing long term money. The 5 year and 30 year. Growth is slowing so you get punished for not growing.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reverse Repo-** June just provided the highest reverse repo of all time. Reverse repo is the buying of securities or equities and and promising to only sell them at a higher price. Think stocks now. Where will money go if you are guaranteeing you'll only sell at a higher price.\n\n&gt;!Repos and reverse repos are short term borrowed money. With such high reverse repos, better make sure you beat that increased short term rate.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TOUR OF CASINO**\n\nYou walk into the casino, the thermostat is set at a mild temperature.

Dividends generally pay 2-4%. The issue here is that in an economic slow down, companies may see a reduced revenue and the dividend payout might not beat the interest rates. If you get 2% in a savings account, why risk the biscuit for the dividend?\n\n**Roulette** (&gt;!Defense Pharma &amp; Research Heavy Stocks!&lt;): To save money during inflation, there are generally budget cuts to stop spending. This affects the defense sector in many ways. Future grants are generally pulled and R&amp;D is usually cut.\n\n**Craps** (&gt;!ETFs, recovery, inelastic holdings!&lt;): Now sure what to hold, want to be safe, let someone else do it for you. ETFs generally hold some form of dividend stock or businesses that stay flat for stable growth. At times like this where there are still better investments on the table like hiked treasuries, foreign investments, and growth stonks.

Most people did not think too much of this as they thought he was referring to the then recent price action. However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gd2ixiclhz571.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755c06a09499b39b429a492e67190e41478d5372\n\nHe tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1. The 5 for 1 stock split was announced on 8/11.\n\n[Tesla Announces a Five-for-One Stock Split | Tesla Investor Relations](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split)\n\nSo why do I think he is hinting at another split? There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blo3ms45iz571.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dbbf2cc89dcd10a9a04460c47c221f67ab92f99\n\nBesides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.\n\nWhile this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to "Elon Musk, the 2nd" which could be referring to the second stock split.\n\nFurthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bw87j61djz571.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbd74f28b426161b14ac8854c257a12e030564f4\n\nHe could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.\n\nAssuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play. Last stock split announcement saw a 13%+ rise the day after as well as an 80%+ rise between the announcement and the actual split which was roughly two weeks later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions: TSLA 6/25 650C &amp; TSLA 7/9 800C\n\nTLDR; Elon Musk hinting at 4 for 1 stock split on 6/23.

I'm so thankful for  all of the WSB OG crew for  bringing me up a few levels. Thank you so   much.\n\nThis  is the lazy TL:DR; on  shorting the market - because WSB is about  crushing it, one way or the  other. Friday was just the beginning of a  long, arduous downturn, and  most of you will figure that out at some  point in the next few  weeks/months.\n\nOK,  long story  short, we're headed into bear territory, and you want to be  ready. If  you don't believe it, great, just wait longer.\n\nFor the rest of you, here's the lessons to be learned without doing any work.\n\n1. **$UVXY Calls.**   The VIX (volatility index) jumps the most with market downturns. It's   the fastest, easiest way to make money outside of a 0DTE SPY put. There   are two options for VIX calls that are easy for the average ape: $UVXY   and $VIXY. Both of these are VIX ETFs. Having done *too much*   research and comparing between these two, I found UVXY to be the  better  of the two. It responds to the market faster and climbs higher   faster.Buying **$UVXY** call at the **ONSET** of a bear market is the first move.\n2. **$SOXS Calls.** The next best call is for **$SOXS**. SOXS is an ETF bear on semiconductors which I've found hurts the worst at the **ONSET**    of a bear market, but stabilizes after a few weeks or months  (depending on the severity of the fall) due to semis have real assets.  There are a few more options a little further down,  but they don't  react as well to the downturn in the short term.\n3. **$SPXU Calls.**   While SOXS lasts nicely for abou the first 10-15% of a downturn (in   time) the value of the semiconductor stocks levels out due to real   assets. This means the next thing to cash in on is $**SPXU**.   $SPXU is a 3x Bear ETF on the S&amp;P500. It responds better than  $SQQQ  at the outset, so it's better to have at the front end of the  downturn.\n4. **$SQQQ Calls.**   After about a month or two, $SQQQ starts to outperform $SPXU. So if   you're playing this week-by-week, you'll want to switch up from $SPXU to   $SQQQ. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, it really  ramps  better than $SPXU. It's basically the same thing by a different  name.\n5. **$TWM Calls.**  $TWM is a Russell 2000 3x Bear ETF. Calls basically don't exist, but when the market tanks, these puppies fly.\n6. **$SPY Puts.**  The classic. Best way to make/lose money in a flash. Highly recommend  0dte puts if you're feeling it and the IV is below a ridiculous number.\n\n**Some strategy:**\n\nOK, if you're not sure what you're doing, just buy some LEAPS of **$SPXU** calls. Meaning, buy out to Jan 21 or something. If nothing happens, you lose 10-20% and you can bail...\n\nIf   you're in for this hard-core, add these tickers to your watchlist, and   buy some 06/25 $UVXY calls ASAP.For those who are risk averse: buy  about  $2 ITM calls. For those who are feeling frisky, buy about $2 OTM  calls.\n\nI have no clue how bad the market will tank, or when. No freaking clue. But it will, and it will big time.\n\n**TL:DR;**\n\nBuy $UVXY calls now, $SOXS calls now, $SPXU calls soon, $SQQQ calls later and play $SPY shorts along the way.\n\nMy  Positions:  \n06/25 $UVXY $28/$30C ($20 was on the money when I bought  it)  \n06/25 $SOXS $8C  \n06/25 $SPXU $20C  \n07/26 $UVXY $36C  \n07/26 $SPXU $2xC  \n01/22  CALLS on everything\n\nI have more positions than this, but there are to  many to list.

With a gross margin of 64.11% for this quarter, and an average quarterly gross margin of 60.96% over the past 5 years, NVDIA is primed to continue its dominance for the future. Also it is important to note that **NVDIA beats out its main competitors Intel and AMD in gross margins on average over the past 5 years and over the last quarter.**\xa0\n\n## NVDIA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 54.74% Jan 2019**\n\n**Maximum 65.06% Apr 2020**\n\n**Average 60.96%**\n\n## AMD Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 4.51% Sep 2016**\n\n**Maximum 46.07% Mar 2021**\n\n**Average 37.34%**\n\n## Intel Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 53.13% Sep 2020**\n\n**Maximum 64.50% Sep 2018**\n\n**Average 59.65%**\n\nNow onto reasons why I think NVIDIA is a strong buy.\xa0\n\n1. **Price targets**\n\nNVDIA is still undervalued with multiple price targets very much higher than the current price of what NVDIA is trading at currently along with multiple buy ratings. One example in specific, **Bank of America recently upgraded NVDIA price target to $900 from $800 and reiterated its Buy rating.** The bank said its takeaway is that "rising AI adoption, expanding use-cases across cloud, enterprise, edge, telco can help NVDA double its content and triple its data center sales over the next few years." Bank of America said it expects NVIDIA\'s data center business to grow at a 35% compounded rate to become its largest segment by year-end 2025. Other notable price targets include 854- Jefferies, 800- Robert W Baird, 800- Rosenblatt Securities.\xa0\n\n1. **Acquisition of ARM**\n\n\xa0ARM can‚Äôt stay independent for long, even the CEO thinks so. Arm CEO Simon Segars\xa0made the case that if it stays independent, Arm wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep up with the increasing demands of its customers for more complex chips that can perform a wider variety of functions. The simple solution? Getting acquired by another company. NVIDIA seems to be in the lead to acquire ARM and other rivals are terrified. They have a good reason to be, as NVDIA already a strong leader wants to spend $40 billion to acquire U.K. chip technology provider Arm Holdings. This acquisition will reshape the industry entirely. NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang said the acquisition of ARM is an opportunity to create a company that can generate even more new ideas, and bring more innovation to its customers in the form of intellectual property. A quote in specific, ‚ÄúThe benefit to the market, and to the Arm customers will be more IP, better IP, more accelerated road maps and hopefully taking Arm to the far reaches of what is becoming ‚Ä¶the diversity of computing that is literally going in every single direction,‚Äù Huang said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre covering everything from cloud, to edge, to \\[internet of things\\], to high performance computing, to microprocessors, to accelerated computing‚Äîeverything.‚Äù\n\n2. **Internet currency ( Not allowed to say actual word so replaced it with internet)**\n\nGPU‚Äôs can be used for internet currency and its mining purposes. It‚Äôs possible to blame the graphic card shortage on these miners but nonetheless, the usage of them is highly prevalent today. NVIDIA\'s releases of processors specifically used for mining poses a huge boost to its revenue and to the internet currency world. **NVIDIA booked $155 million in revenue from CMP cards in its fiscal first quarter.** While internet money is gaining traction around the world, we can expect NVIDIA to continue its dominance and reliability in mining purposes.\xa0\n\n3. **Stock split**\xa0\n\nOn May 21st, NVIDIA announced a 4-1 stock split which would take place on July 19th. So for every one share you own, you will own four instead as the stock splits its price valuation by four. On the day of the news, NVIDIA‚Äôs stock price closed at $599.67. **Since then, the price of NVIDIA‚Äôs stock has gone up around 24% to $743.75**. Not even one month has passed and the stock is up 24%! With one full month until the split **I predict NVDIA to hit $800 or/and above by the time of the official split**. Call options and shares in my opinion are the way to go for the next month as this could be a great opportunity to invest in a fast growth company.\xa0\n\n4. **Growth**\xa0\n\nNVIDIA has been a great growth tech stock to own recently with the numbers backing this statement up.\xa0\n\n**NVIDIA RETURNS**\xa0\n\nYTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)\n\n1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)\n\n6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)\n\n1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)\n\nNow for the returns on NVIDIA compared to AMD and INTEL.\xa0\n\n**NVIDIA RETURNS**\xa0\n\nYTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)\n\n1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)\n\n6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)\n\n1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)\n\n**AMD RETURNS**\n\nYTD: -7.06 (-7.70%)\n\n1 Year: +30.61 (+56.64%)\n\n6 Months: -11.27 (-11.75%)\n\n1 Month: +10.21 (+13.72%)\n\n**INTEL RETURNS**\n\nYTD: +5.85\xa0 (+11.74%)\n\n1 Year: -4.41 (-7.34%)\n\n6 Months: +8.21 (+17.30%)\xa0\n\n1 Month: +0.83 (+1.51%)\n\n**NVIDIA beats Intel and AMD in every single category growth wise showing complete dominance with its stock price.**\xa0\n\nConcluding I believe NVIDIA is a must buy presplit and the risk is minimum. The stock shows solid uptrend with extreme growth to come. NVIDIA is a strong buy in my personal opinion and an amazing company to be invested in.\xa0'), ('22k YOLO on AAPL Calls, going to the moon when their glasses come out.', '22k YOLO on AAPL Calls, going to the moon when their glasses come out.'), ('They got it wrong.

Sometimes this is their own ass, and other times it is someone else‚Äôs.  \nNot everything has to have an agenda; sometimes you just have a writing deadline.\n\n\nBottom line is that some random desk jockey writing that CLNE will be worth somewhere in the mid to high teens does not mean it will ever get there.  \nAfter all, stocks trade based on a company‚Äôs current value which means the price is not going to reach ten times what a company might be worth at the end of the century nor will a stock price stay uplifted while a company does nothing but lose money.  \nJust look at green energy-adjacent tickers like TSLA or NKLA as good examples of how stock prices tend to reflect an objective valuation of a company.\n\n\n## Partnerships\n\n\nSometimes all it takes to hype a stock is having a partnership with a bigger company announced, or even just having rumors of one coming.  \nIn CLNE‚Äôs case, the partnership is confirmed and it‚Äôs with the biggest of the big, Amazon!  \nThis is huge! Who doesn‚Äôt love Amazon?  \n\n\n‚Ä¶but that is actually a problem. Everyone loves Amazon, and Amazon knows it.  \nWhile having signed a deal with one of the biggest companies on the planet sounds great in a vacuum, talking it up is akin to bragging about getting knocked up by a celebrity while conveniently ignoring the pre-coital contract you signed that specifies that the father does not have to have anything to do with you unless the kid turns out to be somehow profitable.  \nMeanwhile, Amazon gets to run around creating more legally deniable baby mamas since, unless CLNE found some leverage to convince the retail behemoth to sign with exclusivity, it is in their best interest to plant as many seeds as they can and only execute on the deals that end up being worth the most.\n\n\nLet‚Äôs look at the CLNE/Amazon deal specifically.  Amazon gets bunch of CLNE warrants for something like $13/share with the chance to get more if they buy $500 million worth of fuel from CLNE.  \nThe common pro-CLNE read of this situation is that obviously Amazon believes that CLNE will be worth at least $13/share in the not-so-distant future, right? \n\n\nWrong.  \n\n\nThis deal gives Amazon two pretty clear escape hatches:\n\n\n- Amazon can just choose not to exercise the warrants.\n\n\n- Amazon can just not buy the fuel.\n\n\nThe entire burden is on CLNE.  \nAmazon is under no obligation to do anything. If it does, sure, there‚Äôs profit to be made, but the stock market rotates around sure things, not speculation.\n\n\n## Options Chains\n\n\nTrying to read an option chain to predict a stock‚Äôs trajectory is like trying to use tea leaves to predict your future. Any alignment is better credited to coincidence rather than fate.\n\n\nFor example, CLNE‚Äôs max pain for this month‚Äôs expiry is currently at $8.  \nThis is not a cosmic sign of the ticker‚Äôs destiny, it is simply a mathematical anomaly created by hundreds of gamblers paying for the privilege to throw a dart at a board. \n\n\nAnother fortune teller‚Äôs tool I have seen rolled out for CLNE and other stocks is looking at open interest for various call strikes and trying to envision them forming a ramp upwards. If such a ramp is found, the argument is that there is some magical price that will cause every single writer to simultaneously hedge all their calls at once, resulting in the price instantly rising to infinity.  \n\n\nProblem is, that is not how hedging works. Its not even how ramps work, frankly.  \nGamma events are rare because, like real ramps, they require momentum and fear.  \nNo one writing uncovered calls 100% OTM is rushing to buy thousands of shares just because the underlying price rose 10% in a single day two months out from expiration. They are just going to wait to see what happens which invariably will be the price resettling where it is supposed to be.\n\n\nIn the stock market, the most sure you are that an event will occur, the less likely it is to happen.\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\nI hope this whole lot of words has been helpful to at least some of you. Beyond the specifics, I would just encourage you all to see beyond what others are touting as ‚ÄúDue Diligence‚Äù and do your own due diligence in turn to arrive closer to the truth.\n\n\nMost importantly, remember this:  \nCLNE to $5 by EOM.'), ('Spy to the moon baby', 'Spy to the moon baby')], '2021-08-21': [('Buy your spy puts ladies and gentlemen, Lil Yachty is dropping an album.', 'Buy your spy puts ladies and gentlemen, Lil Yachty is dropping an album.Lil Yachty is the key to this market.

Right now, we\'re witnessing some of the worst global supply chain issues in modern times and rapidly rising inflation. One way to protect a portfolio against inflation is by buying high-quality oil assets. I have 17% exposure in my long-term dividend account consisting of Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and Valero Energy (VLO). I also own some smaller oil stocks on the side, which are **Marathon Oil (****MRO****)** and Devon Energy (DVN). This article is about Marathon Oil as the stock just made new highs with support from a ton of macro fundamentals. As I haven\'t discussed the stock since May, it\'s time to once again reflect on one of America\'s finest oil stocks. So, bear with me!\n\n# Must-Own Oil\n\nI have started a lot of oil-related articles this way, but I am a huge believer in owning high-quality oil assets. In this case, I define high-quality oil as a company with a solid footprint in the oil industry, a solid balance sheet, and the ability to pay a high dividend. After all, being long energy isn\'t always fun as everyone who held energy assets for more than a year will agree with.\n\nFor example, the Energy ETF (XLE) - which is basically 50% XOM and CVX - is still down 46% from its 2014 highs. Including dividends, the decline is -29%. The situation at Marathon is different as the stock is down 62% from its 2014 highs. This includes dividends.\n\nBefore I continue to discuss why this will continue to change (dividend growth is picking up), let\'s take a quick look at the macro environment because oil is back!\n\nFor the first time since 2018, it looks like oil will make a successful attempt at breaking above the massive resistance area close to $75.\n\nIf that happens, oil could easily continue its uptrend and **force people into inflation trades.** Using the ratio between the S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Exploration &amp; Production ETF (XOP) and the S&amp;P 500, we see that energy assets are still extremely poorly performing compared to the stock market. I don\'t disagree that the post-2014 downtrend was justified because we were in a rather deflationary environment. Now, that\'s changing and investors are seriously underweight energy.\n\nAccording to the State Street [website](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy), the S&amp;P 500 has just 2.75% energy exposure. For example, industrials are at 8% and utilities are 2.5%. Information technology exposure is 27.6%.\n\nAll of this sounds good, but we need a reason to make the case for this rotation. In May, when I wrote my most recent Marathon Oil article, I discussed an expected supply/demand imbalance.\n\n&gt;First of all, I am a big believer in a demand/supply imbalance. Unlike in the previous recovery, we are now NOT dealing with a situation where supply is outperforming demand. According to EIA data (graph below), we are about to witness an extended period with negative to flat inventory changes as demand will likely outpace supply. As EIA expectations are often very conservative, I think that this effect will be bigger than some might think. Especially once economies reopen, we will see a rapid increase in energy demand.\n\nThis supply/demand imbalance is now materializing in a huge way. And not just in oil. All over the world, we\'re seeing the need for affordable energy. Here are some examples.\n\nNewcastle Coal futures are going through the roof as China and India desperately need coal to maintain growth and because natural gas prices are exploding as well - coal is a cheap alternative.\n\nAs Reuters [writes](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-slips-opec-weighs-output-boost-tight-market-2021-10-01/), there\'s a huge need for affordable fuel, and that\'s where oil benefits from.\n\n&gt;"If OPEC+ sticks to the script and only delivers the planned 400,000 bpd increase in November, energy markets will shortly be seeing $90 oil prices," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, adding that any increase smaller than 600,000 barrels should boost prices.  \nOil is also finding support as a surge in natural gas prices globally prompts power producers to move away from gas. Generators in Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Middle East have started switching fuels.\n\nIn this case, it looks very reasonable to expect $90 oil if OPEC+ doesn\'t aggressively hike - and why would they? On a side note, we\'re talking Brent oil $90. Right now, Brent is at $79, so please do not confuse it with WTI oil, which is at $75.7. Nonetheless, $90 Brent still means incredible upside for oil companies.\n\nMoreover, U.S. crude oil stocks are hovering close to their 5-year lows. I am not making the case for lows below 400 million barrels, but I do not expect oil to make it back to the average unless new lockdown measures are implemented.\n\n# So, why Marathon?\n\n**Marathon Is The Place To Be**\n\nSo, why Marathon? First of all, Marathon has a 50% crude oil, 50% NGL/gas revenue breakdown. Most of it is located in high-margin areas as the company sold its underperforming assets in recent years.\n\n&gt;If you\'re new to Marathon Oil, you can basically think of it as a US-only oil play. The company does have some minor exposure overseas but used the past few years to sell its foreign assets to solely focus on high-margin U.S. projects. Over 90% of the company\'s Bakken and Eagle Ford operations are established in so-called high-quality areas which makes capital investments more rewarding. This is one of the reasons why the company is free cash flow breakeven (so, AFTER accounting for capital expenses) at less than $35 WTI. - *Article*\n\nThink about that for a second, Marathon Oil is breakeven at $35 WTI. This means that something truly terrible needs to happen in order for Marathon to enter a situation where it has to deal with a longer-term funding deficit. Even better, with rising oil prices, this means tons of free cash flow. On a side note, while I don\'t care for long-term capital gains in energy (I only want yield), we\'re in a truly remarkable situation as most energy companies can repair their balance sheet for the first time since 2014.\n\nFor example, Marathon oil is able to generate$8 billion in free cash flow at $60 WTI on a five-year basis. Right now, we\'re close to $80. This is based on a 40% reinvestment rate (capital expenditures). In 2021, analysts expect MRO to generate $2.0 billion in free cash flow, followed by another $2.0 billion in 2022. That\'s wild as the company did $460 million in 2018. In my prior article, expectations were below $1.4 billion. Please be aware that this is one of the reasons why oil is high in the first place. Upstream (companies who drill for oil) has found that ever-increasing production only hurts themselves. Why not focus on free cash flow generation instead? It also helps as it doesn\'t mess with OPEC members who were never happy to cut their own production to indirectly bail out their competitors in the U.S.\n\nRight now, Marathon Oil has an $11.2 billion market cap. This means that the company\'s expected free cash flow yield is 17.8%. In other words, unless the company pays a 17.8% dividend, we\'ll see both a high dividend and a massive improvement in balance sheet health.\n\nFor example, the company is expected to lower net debt from $4.7 billion at the end of 2020 to less than $1.5 billion in 2022. That would imply a less than 0.5x net leverage ratio. In such a scenario, even EBITDA comparable to the 2016 lows ($2.0 billion) would result in a net leverage ratio of less than 1.0x. If (and that\'s a big if) we were to encounter a long-term uptrend in oil, the company could easily turn net debt into net cash.\n\n**Almost needless to say, the valuation is still very attractive.**\n\nAuthor: Leo Nelisson\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Position:**\n\n* **\\*I am long on MRO in a straight share purchase** given that there will be volatility in the market over the next few months and the exact timing is difficult to predict. But if you have MRO options that you feel good about about, please share in the comments'), ('The basic investment types explained in a way a monkey could understand üêí', "The basic investment types explained in a way a monkey could understand üêí#**Introduction**\nEveryone talks about what to invest in, but they often skip a step when talking to beginners. What to invest in starts with knowing what is available. Here are the fundamental investment types I will be covering today:\n\n\n* Stocks ‚Äì fractional ownership of a company sold in the form of shares\n* Bonds ‚Äì a loan to a company or government that will pay interest in the future\n* Commodities ‚Äì a raw material or agricultural product that can be bought or sold\n* Mutual Funds and ETFs  ‚Äì containers holding many stocks, bonds, or commodities\n\n\nEach of these have their own unique set of attributes and uses. They‚Äôre differentiated based on risk, specialization, and ease of use. I might go into these details in the future, but for now I want to start at the very beginning. \n\n#**Stocks**\nLet‚Äôs say you own a business. You currently only have one location but would like to open another. You know your business is worth about $1 million dollars and that it costs $100,000 to open a new store. You decide to create 10,000 shares and attempt to sell them for $100 each. Each share represents a 0.01% ownership stake in the company. Let‚Äôs say you sell 2,000 of the shares. Now you own 8,000 shares and the person or people you sold the shares to own 2,000. This means you own 80% of the company and the others own 20%. They paid you $200,000 for those shares which you can now use to open two new stores. \n\nSo why did the people in the example buy $200,000 worth of your business‚Äôs stock? People buy stocks for two primary reasons. The first is that they expect the business to do well. A business that does well will grow and increase the value of its shares. This is called capital appreciation. If you go ahead and builds two more stores that generate the same income as the first, the value of the business will have roughly tripled. The $200,000 that was invested could now easily be worth $600,000. On the other hand, what if you tried to open two new stores and they both failed? Everyone would see that you‚Äôre bad at running this business and those shares might only be worth $100,000 now. The second reason is to collect dividend payments from the business. A dividend is when a company takes a portion of its earnings and pays them out to its shareholders. These are more common among older well established businesses that have consistent income.\n\nStocks are most commonly traded on stock exchanges. The United States is home to the two largest exchanges in the world, the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq Stock Market. To buy or sell stocks yourself on the exchanges you need to go through a brokerage. This might sound like a daunting process but can usually be set up in less than 15 minutes. Once you have an account set up and money deposited buying and selling shares is nearly instantaneous. \n\n#**Bonds**\nWhen you need to make a large purchase like a new car you don‚Äôt typically pay it all up front. You might not have enough money at the moment or want a way to spread the purchase out over time. To do this you get a loan. Let‚Äôs say you want to buy a $20,000 car. You spend $4,000 on the down payment and agree to pay the rest over the next three years. You get to take the car home today because the loan pays the dealership the remaining amount owed. In return for lending you this money the bank is going to charge interest as you pay the loan back. Let‚Äôs assume the interest rate is 3% per year. At this rate you‚Äôll end up paying the bank back about $16,751. The additional $751 is their payment for taking on the risk of loaning you that money.\n\nBonds and loans have a lot in common. They‚Äôre both used to finance expensive purchases, have interest rates, and cover a set period of time. There are some differences though. The car loan was paid off in monthly payments over the course of three years. Each monthly payment paid some of the interest as well as some of the initial $16,000 principal. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre the bank. Instead of writing a car loan you use the money to buy a bond worth $16,000 at the same 3% interest rate over the same three year period. As the holder of the bond you would be entitled to interest rate payments, twice per year, for three years. Each semiannual payment would be 1.5% of $16,000 or $240. After three years the bond would mature, you would receive your last interest payment, and you would receive your entire $16,000 back.\n\nLet‚Äôs take a look at how stocks and bonds compare. Both of them can be used to raise money, but they do so in significantly different ways. When you buy stock you are buying a fractional ownership in the business. You do not get your initial investment back unless the company pays dividends, or you sell your shares and give up ownership. Bonds can also be used to raise money, but they do not offer any ownership. When a company sells bonds it knows that it will have to pay them back in the future which can be costly. When it sells stock its current shareholders lose some of their ownership and therefore value. Let‚Äôs say there are 100 shares of company XYZ and they decided to issue 20 more. Previously every share was worth 1% of the company, now every share is only worth 0.83% of the company. This is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding what stocks and bonds are and how they compare to each other. \n\n#**Commodities**\nStocks and bonds are each considered to be an asset class. An asset class is a group of investments that have similar characteristics and have to follow the same regulations. Stock in Apple is not the exact same as stock in Visa, but they serve the same purpose, can be traded the same way, and follow the same rules. The same can be said about bonds. A bond that takes seven years to mature is not the exact same as one that takes ten years, but they are both going to be structured the same. The third asset class we will be covering are commodities.\n\nA commodity is a raw material or primary agricultural product. These products are essentially the same regardless of where they come from. Copper, gold, oil, iron, and lumber are all examples of raw material commodities. Corn, soybeans, meat, and milk are all agricultural commodities. There may be minor fluctuations in quality, but in order to be traded on exchanges they need to meet a minimum requirement. These materials form the foundation of almost everything our economy produces. \n\nUnlike with stocks or bonds, commodities are not used as a way to raise money. They‚Äôre traded as a way to protect the producer from risk. Let‚Äôs say you can grow 10,000 bushels of wheat in a good year. You would like to get at least $8 per bushel once it‚Äôs harvested. What happens if there is a perfect year for crops and everyone else has produced more than expected. This increase in supply pushes the price lower because buyers have more to choose from. The price per bushel is now only $5. In this situation you would only earn 63% as much as you were forecasting which can be hard to handle as a business. In order to protect yourself from this situation you might want to create a contract with a wheat buyer on an exchange. This contract could include you agreeing to sell your wheat for $7 per bushel at the end of the summer. This is less than the $8 you are hoping for, but it will be guaranteed. Assuming the person buying the contract was also expecting wheat to be worth $8 per bushel, they will see this as a good deal. When prices for materials are known in advance it‚Äôs easier to budget and plan which is a benefit for both parties. \n\nOdds are you aren‚Äôt looking to buy or sell massive quantities of wheat, or any other raw materials. If you‚Äôre looking at investing in commodities it‚Äôs probably going to be in oil, gold, or common metals like copper. Thankfully you don‚Äôt need to be directly trading contracts with the producers to do this. There are shares that can be bought and sold like stocks on a stock exchange. Each share represents a fixed amount of the commodity, such as an ounce of gold or a barrel of oil. The primary reason people buy commodities is to protect themselves from inflation. This works because as the price of things increase, the price of the raw materials must also increase. \n\n#**Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds**\nNow that you have an idea of what the three most popular asset classes are, let‚Äôs take a look at a couple of the tools associated with them. Mutual funds and ETFs are both collections of stocks, bonds, or commodities that can be traded. Instead of hand selecting companies, bonds, or commodities these collections allow you to purchase a fraction of many of them all at once. \n\nThe S&amp;P 500 is an index that tracks 500 of the largest companies in the United States. It‚Äôs often used as a general gauge for the US economy. If the economy is doing well and growing, this index will also be growing. Instead of having to purchase shares in all 500 businesses by hand there are numerous ETFs that will do that for you. The most popular one has a ticker name of SPY. When you buy a share of SPY, 5.9% of your money is being put in Apple stock, 2.29% is put into Facebook stock, and so on. The larger the company the larger the fraction of your money they get. This is called a market cap weighed fund. \n\nSPY is an ETF which means you can buy or sell it at any time with ease. FXAIX also covers the companies of the S&amp;P 500, but it is a mutual fund. What is the difference between the two? Well there‚Äôs not much. The most noticeable one is that mutual funds cannot be traded throughout the day. They can only be purchased at the end of the day. Although not a rule, mutual funds are much more likely to be actively managed than an ETF. Active management means there is a professional portfolio manager in charge of selecting when to buy or sell the things the mutual fund holds. ETFs are much more likely to be passively managed. This means they track a set list of stocks automatically.\n\n#**Conclusion**\nThese four categories make up a vast majority of investments. Being able to understand how each of them work is crucial in making your own investment choices. Hopefully this post was able to bring up even more questions than it answered if you're new. Now that you know what the major fundamental asset classes are you might ask yourself why you would choose one over the other. This was touched on, but I never went into detail on the risk, return, history, or combination of them. All of these ideas warrant their own posts which may come in the future.

Facebook said late Monday that ‚Äúthe root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.‚Äù The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company‚Äôs platforms currently have billions users.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism\n\n&gt; * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to ‚Äúgo back to Africa‚Äù and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz‚Äôs lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla‚Äôs mandatory arbitration agreements.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cufqIAb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wz4zrQT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8lPe5bB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/U5PgJ90.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vzQs6xT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/892SyJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xcmpnv9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KpOco76.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/JnGeOww.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3a1JSQR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lordstown Motors (RIDE)** ‚Äì The electric truck maker was downgraded to ‚Äúunderweight‚Äù from ‚Äúequal-weight‚Äù at Morgan Stanley, which notes that the recently announced sale of Lordstown‚Äôs Ohio plant to Foxconn values the plant at less than a fifth of prior estimates.

Wall Street looks higher after Monday‚Äôs tech decline\n\n&gt; * U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Tuesday as tech stocks bounced, one day after the Nasdaq sank more than 2.1%. Monday‚Äôs session was marked by rotation out of tech names as bond yields remained elevated. The S&amp;P 500 on Monday fell 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 323 points, or nearly 1%.\n&gt; * PepsiCo on Tuesday raised its full-year forecast after its quarterly earnings and revenue topped analysts‚Äô expectations. The company‚Äôs shares were up nearly 1% in the premarket.\n&gt; * Johnson &amp; Johnson said Tuesday it has submitted data to the FDA for emergency use authorization of a booster shot of its Covid vaccine for all adults. J&amp;J shares rose modestly.\n&gt; * Volatility that accompanied September‚Äôs market decline continued in October, with the first two trading days of the new month up big and then down big. The Nasdaq, as of Monday‚Äôs close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&amp;P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high. The Dow was more than 4.5% away from its Aug. 16 record close.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn‚Äôt act on debt limit , Yellen says\n\n&gt; * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. ‚ÄúI do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government‚Äôs bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government‚Äôs bills,‚Äù Yellen said on ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to ‚Äúget out of the way‚Äù on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves\n\n&gt; * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday‚Äôs vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed\n\n&gt; * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday‚Äôs hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program ‚Äú60 Minutes,‚Äù which aired Sunday night. She insisted that ‚ÄúFacebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.‚Äù Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.\n\n&gt; * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that ‚Äúthe root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.‚Äù The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company‚Äôs platforms currently have billions users.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism\n\n&gt; * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to ‚Äúgo back to Africa‚Äù and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz‚Äôs lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla‚Äôs mandatory arbitration agreements.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/cufqIAb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wz4zrQT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/8lPe5bB.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/RtabSpV.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/U5PgJ90.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aubwMW2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/vzQs6xT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/892SyJi.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/xcmpnv9.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/KpOco76.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/JnGeOww.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3a1JSQR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; **Lordstown Motors (RIDE)** ‚Äì The electric truck maker was downgraded to ‚Äúunderweight‚Äù from ‚Äúequal-weight‚Äù at Morgan Stanley, which notes that the recently announced sale of Lordstown‚Äôs Ohio plant to Foxconn values the plant at less than a fifth of prior estimates.

Paramount+ subscription is 4.99$ and 9.99$, and is now bundled with Showtime content for just $9.99 or 12.99$, which is significantly cheaper than $NFLX $8.99, $13.99 and $17.99. Paramount+ is currently available in 25 countries including Australia and New Zealand which launched in August 2021, and will be in 45 countries including Europe by beginning of 2022, so expect at least 100 million more subs subscribing by next year as soon as it becomes available. My projection being 150-180 million subs by end of 2022. Also, in July 2021, Paramount+ and Showtime combined accounted for 22% of all sign-ups in the US, while NFLX only 5%. As you can see $VIAC is the growth stock and $NFLX is the stagnating piece of crap with no growth left, and that\'s why they are moving into fucking games.\n\n[July 2021 SVOD signups in US.](https://preview.redd.it/rc7zbit9imr71.png?width=1354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d747d40ded4a9eb6dd4677266011b5f8a7c40e3)\n\n**Result:** $VIAC should trade at least with P/E multiple of 15-20 = 90-105$ per share, in comparison to $NFLX that has P/E multiple of 60, and $DIS P/E multiple of 80.\n\n**Key Financials and Subscriber Growth:**\n\n**Paramount+ added +6.5 million new sVoD subscribers (42M total)** during Q2 while Netflix reported only +1.5 millions subs globally.

Keeping everything else the same the loss turns into a profit of $440,915.40. So why would he go on CNBC and say different, because he hopes nobody will do the math on their own and trust him. This is pure manipulation or he‚Äôs gone senile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqtolml905481.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af724b9f388a8d3796b5af8264eeeba33c0156a3\n\nChanging a few lines of the income statement and keeping all else the same makes no sense as a bear case anyway, most lines in this income statement derive their value from previous entries or are items that would go up and down according to underlying factors, such as cost of revenue would increase with more revenue, expense related to admin would start to taper off over time and Etc.\n\nOnly reason this went anywhere is CNBC hyped Jim Chanos up to be an accounting expert, they even started the interview by reliving his Enron short, but in reality Jim has been losing money left and right and his firm is down a lot. This was a clear attempt by CNBC and Jim to manipulate paper hand investors to let their shares go for little to nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqwir0ca05481.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830d764ff43e4cd132fcf9f20cd6591004db9d0a\n\n**Reason #2 ‚Äì upcoming catalyst to reverse bad quarter**\n\nShorts are going to want to get out of DKNG around this time, with the combination of NBA, NFL and NHL, the next earnings should be a blowout, plus will have the inclusion of new states that just legalized. Our hope is we send them off with a loss rather than a gain.\n\nDuring the last earnings, it was revealed that the lower revenue than expected was caused by favorites winning in NFL games during the weeks that were included in that earnings reports. This is an outlier event that can happen to gambling stocks and as we know just like options trading, you win some you lose some. But based on this information we can project with the recent upsets, the next quarter should actually have a significant increase in revenue. Basically people like to string favorites together in parlays for a better payout, if those hit , the house loses, if there are a healthy amount of upsets, the house makes money, if there are a lot of upsets, the house makes even more money. Look at some of the wins and losses these past few weeks and you will see plenty of upsets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aggvdt0b05481.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52cb732be4cb67a29a75d887e1d6be5d2f378f36\n\nUpsets outweighing favorites for the majority of the NFL season\n\n**Huge growth**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htn337ob05481.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffd62dd3655b0d43111b156c10b08a706f57f4a0\n\nGrowth comes at a cost and we can see by the income statement, DKNG spent a lot to grow the company, but with that they got market leadership, brand recognition, acquired a quality operator in Golden Nugget Casinos, and overall increased shareholder value.\n\nphysical casino‚Äôs are falling behind the online providers, but competition remains fierce and requires spending to open new markets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqv1ghjc05481.png?width=838&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a79b8d9dcaf5a038b12d140a84f60d4ffc0a1c0f\n\n**Inside buying ‚Äì always a good sign**\n\nWe have seen a combination of the founders and exec team buying shares in the open market or exercising and holding options of DKNG. This is a positive sign as this time of the year we would see more selling. Also we notice a lot of selling by the big execs in anticipation of new tax laws next year, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and even Microsoft‚Äôs CEO had sold significant amounts of shares. So seeing the execs at DKNG buy at this low price shows confidence in the company‚Äôs future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oeix73bd05481.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fdc10c5ed14dd0051b765ac2f5a78a983c03422\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bn79515e05481.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84ba0e0047d9dc4e8bcc5f1698124d7d3cb6eb5d\n\n**Cash Burn and overspending concerns are overblown**\n\nWe get the same argument from short sellers about this stock as we do for all growth stocks. They burn cash and that‚Äôs a signal to investors that the stock in not well capitalized and will need to raise funds either through debt or equity issuance, which is dilutive to shareholders.\n\nBut as we can see from the below figures from the cash flow statement, the cash burn is small relative to the actual cash balance. The net change could also be seen below along with the growth in revenue, the ROI on this is clear, the more they spend to open new markets the higher growth is but when these markets start to mature, like New Jersey, they can become profitable within 2-3 years.\n\nSo, the cash burn on DKNG differs from other growth stocks because they are not trying to invent a new product, spending millions on R&amp;D and only to half the product flop, they are gaining market shares in states that are newly legalized for gambling and converting existing daily fantasy clients to sports betting clients. Low risk spending in my opinion because they have done this successfully in other states and continue to execute on the marketing campaigns, they spend on by obtaining the #1 position in the states they are in, over time. If the state is not worth spending on, too small or not enough potential users, they will just spend less, it‚Äôs not out of control by any means, and well within the cash balance they have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m336726f05481.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db5fe731d8dd9510c83bac21be45a8f85568ff30\n\nThe below tweet from the CEO should boost confidence in the stock for long term holders, to be well capitalized is a bold statement for growth stocks but not for DKNG. They have a large cash balance, little to no change in cash over quarters and have already stated an equity offering would only come after the stock passes $125.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tpuklcuf05481.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b749e54f4a573ebee9a0e1408c1126548f0922c5\n\nDKNG can be the next Amazon or TSLA, in this case the physical casinos are physical retail and legacy auto. The growth story is the same, operate at a loss, continue to growth, kill the competition, and disrupt the market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35lempmg05481.png?width=982&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d147503372e12da13b1a29bf7324b2c0b4223ded\n\n**Trend change - Not just a Covid Play**\n\nMore and more people are betting online, and this is disruptive to physical casinos. Even with the emergence of physical casinos into the online space like BetMGM and Penn with barstool, the motivation to pursue this area is not strong with physical casinos, due to cannibalizing themselves.\n\nWe see in this article [https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/\\_/id/32753855/first-1-billion-month-nevada-sportsbooks](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/32753855/first-1-billion-month-nevada-sportsbooks) , a huge trend change, over 64% of bets came from online, and this is in Nevada, a destination for physical casinos, imagine the rest of the country. And this came in a month were casinos were open and travel was not restricted in Vegas.\n\n**Espn deal + twitter**\n\nESPN already has a relationship with DKNG from an earlier investment and a partnership would be worth billions. Same with twitter as the access to users opens opportunities to market and convert new users.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1j7h0ih05481.png?width=817&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a53a0b498fa076914056c2eed672bdf3c36014c\n\n[**https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2021/08/27/espn-reportedly-in-talks-with-caesars-entertainment-and-draftkings-for-licensing-deal-worth-billions/?sh=373a985190ec**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2021/08/27/espn-reportedly-in-talks-with-caesars-entertainment-and-draftkings-for-licensing-deal-worth-billions/?sh=373a985190ec)\n\n[**https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/**](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/)\n\n[**https://www.legalsportsreport.com/32634/disney-owns-piece-of-draftkings-after-fox-deal/**](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/32634/disney-owns-piece-of-draftkings-after-fox-deal/)\n\n**Differentiation from current gambling stocks**\n\nDraftKing‚Äôs has a strong focus on innovation as you can see by their patent filings, they focus on customer retention, which is a huge competitive advantage in this space, when customers can be swayed from one app to another with free promos.

Zillow, Pelaton, TeleDoc, Zoom have no real relation to DKNG other than being in the ARKK ETF. This has been addressed by Cathie herself and we even see new ETFs popping up to inverse her fund. Wall Street is shorting a basket of stock related to ARKK and DKNG is being dragged down with them. DKNG differs from these particular stocks because they didn‚Äôt have a huge scandal like Zillow, or do an offering like Pelaton, or are considered a work from home stock like ZOOM but the price trend continue to match this basket of growth stocks. This is manipulation but once there is a breakout on DKNG the algos will have to cover and de-basket DKNG from this group similar to when TSLA broke out after their last earnings, which was also a Cathie wood stock.\n\n**Gamma Squeeze Potential**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qc2rmlqt05481.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eac416148759bc6fe638e5680a02acbc3ce9fff9\n\nDKNG is a favorite of options market makers, with all the options outstanding, any breakout will send the stock flying in either direct, with enough buying pressure we squeeze up call options chain.\n\nOption chain skews towards calls for the next few weeks\n\n**Quote from intelligent investor which relates to the current state of growth stocks**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpz583eu05481.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56cfe454d8cc93c52d963411195a548ab9f5754c\n\n**Positions ‚Äì 300 Shares**\n\n**15 ‚Äì Jan 2023 100C options**"), ("Well boys it's been a pleasure yolo'ing with you", "Well boys it's been a pleasure yolo'ing with youI was up (first one is always free) then I was down.

If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and the credit rating agencies would react with downgrades.

The Nasdaq 100 index increased by 3%, an etf that tracks newly public companies increased by 5%, and small caps increased by 2%. The S&amp;P 500 recovered all of the losses suffered following Jerome Powell's hawkish stance a week ago, and was only 0.3% lower than its previous close before the Omicron variant shook markets.\n* The CBOE volatility index fell five points to 22. In New York, the dollar fell and crude oil rose above $71 per barrel.\n* Risk assets are recovering this week after preliminary data showed that the surge in omicron cases has not overwhelmed hospitals and China moved to expand economic support. A Goldman Sachs group basket of non-profitable technology firms rose nearly 6% on Tuesday, recouping nearly half of last week's losses.\n* In terms of data, the US trade deficit shrank, while third-quarter productivity fell. Private consumption was the most important driver of the eurozone's most recent economic expansion.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6gyislen18481.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f203b1d23bebe7d516591df4e861eac43fc7df56\n\n[üïµÔ∏è\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è I SPY TA -

The Nasdaq 100 index increased by 3%, an etf that tracks newly public companies increased by 5%, and small caps increased by 2%. The S&amp;P 500 recovered all of the losses suffered following Jerome Powell's hawkish stance a week ago, and was only 0.3% lower than its previous close before the Omicron variant shook markets.\n* The CBOE volatility index fell five points to 22. In New York, the dollar fell and crude oil rose above $71 per barrel.\n* Risk assets are recovering this week after preliminary data showed that the surge in omicron cases has not overwhelmed hospitals and China moved to expand economic support. A Goldman Sachs group basket of non-profitable technology firms rose nearly 6% on Tuesday, recouping nearly half of last week's losses.\n* In terms of data, the US trade deficit shrank, while third-quarter productivity fell. Private consumption was the most important driver of the eurozone's most recent economic expansion.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6gyislen18481.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f203b1d23bebe7d516591df4e861eac43fc7df56\n\n[üïµÔ∏è\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è I SPY TA -
