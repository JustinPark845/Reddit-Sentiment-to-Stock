# If this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.

"11-25-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Weekly Market Recap and AnalysisTough week really a tough two weeks of trading since CPI that we have had. Tight ranges, quite a bit of volatility which is surprising for a VIX at near 20. But overall I feel despite finishing with my first red week since September 12th that I ended on a positive note. I felt a little off earlier in the week and struggled but today I ended on a good note. I had one swing play that closed red today (IV crush was wild today) but other then that I had 3 scalps for 100% win rate and had 4 level to levels for a 100% win rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x681soymt52a1.png?width=234&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbb14c63470eb2077f5fc14aac206e6a2e2fea74

Spy had the tightest range day I have ever seen it had not even breaking a full $2 move and we also saw IV in the teens and even hit single digits EOD. The IV right now is at the lowest I have seen it in months. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r41olggnt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6085723bda3f607ccdf450b28f445574aa548787

This is the best chart I could find (for free) to show historical trends… but as of today the IV RANK (blue line) is at the lowest level it has been at since April 4th (4 days after the March/ April peak) and IV percentile (green line) is the lowest it has been since November 21st 2021 (which is when spy was hitting 472.4 resistance and closing in on its ATH. While the actual IV % hasn’t really been too helpful trend wise we are seeing though that when the IV rank hits these levels is when we have typically seen the peak put in. this also is correlating well with us closing in on that 2022 bear market resistance line which on the weekly time frame has us right around 410 for next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r7s2dwxnt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e618ec5bdc747a7776531bce5288bed48b9824

When we look at the daily chart here we can see we have put in some pretty stout resistance right there at 402.4 with two candle bodies rejecting it and the November 15th wick hitting that level too. 

This is our key level until we close over this level I am going to start looking for a retrace. There is a pretty good chance come Monday that we see that blue rising wedge support broken. We need to see SPY open over 402.4 and hold it all day otherwise that rising wedge is broken and I will expect a retrace. However, if we can hold that support then I don’t see a reason why we don’t touch that 405.2 channel resistance. 

The daily candle while small is technically a gravestone doji with a double top, however, due to the short day today and the overall low IV I wanted to wait till Monday to act on this. I don’t trust this shorten day to make a full play on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/auuiangot52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e21b119ee6783f38450e01968746795d27831c9

Pretty similar picture here on the weekly. Unless we open over 403.3 and hold that support all week we break the weekly support and will see a sell off back to the 390 to 398 range. 

If the weekly can find support and a green open I will look for 408.9 channel resistance and then the bear market resistance line is that 410 as I mentioned earlier. 

Interestingly enough this is actually the first back to back green months that SPY has put in all year and the first back to back green months since July/ August 2021. 

I am going to watch this weekly rising wedge closely and watch that 410 bear resistance closely. I did decide to sit cash all weekend so that I could see what Monday brought and while I note IV is the lowest it has been in months I wasn’t quite willing to take a risk on a play over the weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/22aim3yot52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=053a2d2d1e7fe783e2db3ea1bb477dfe451631a1

Much of the same here on Futures as we did back test and hold that daily 20ema finishing with a doji here. However, on Futures you can see that it actually turned 4033 previous resistance into support with 4050 being the next resistance. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pxppuaept52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9091c7f73793367946c6a6a6549a3b2082f5443d

It is a little hard to tell but on the Futures weekly this week DID fail to make a new high. Last week touched 4050.75 and this week saw a high of 4049.25. With the weekly 50ema clearly being resistance this is going to be our key level to watch next week of 4050. However, we have found really nice support on the weekly 20ema down near 3925. 

That blue rising wedge support line sits at 4050 and unless we open and hold that then we should expect a retrace next week. 

Bear market resistance for futures weekly sits at 4120 for next week with key level resistance at 4085.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5ne3c8zpt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee284393c0f81ac4f792f0dea2d56eba4c7b69e

So looking ahead to next week… we got some gnarly data coming out AND we got JPOW speaking at 130pm Wednesday where he WILL be answering questions. Honestly with this economic data lineup I would not be surprised to see a choppy Monday/ Tuesday (maybe slightly green) and see a pretty large sell off the rest of the week. 

Looking at tesla it was once again the victim. Having yet again another large pre market that by open was miniscule and led to a red day. This may be the third or 4th time in the last two weeks I have seen this happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/98ttt3lqt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8baa5ded2708a51d68c34a5d8e1d785f38c89af

I posted this analysis of Tesla and its history of drops followed by pops since September. Well we are at day 3 of the pop and we are looking at about a 11.7% move from that bottom to current HOD. That’s pretty damn close to the average 4.2 day pop of 11.81%. 

I actually was pretty tempted to play puts on Tesla due to this trend but I did want to wait out Monday. I am seeing a nice double top right at 185.2 resistance. However, with Tesla holding the daily 8ema and still holding that green support line I was more nervous to jump into puts. There is a chance this pop could last another day or two and we could see a test of the daily 20ema near 192.5 Monday or of the red falling wedge resistance at 190.1 Monday. However, unless Tesla opens green and holds 185.2 Monday then we should break support line and I will be looking at the next leg down. 

Historically speaking… we should look for about a 7day drop of 17.8%... so assuming that today was the top that means by December 6th we should look for a drop to about 152.2. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2r2rn16rt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39f978f535ead6ae4cb9800b78ae1d3e72dc5361

Looking at Tesla falling wedge and the support line of that for December 6th that would give us a support bounce of about 150.6, however, if you look at this previous drop we did not touch the support line completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wmbbqjmrt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4fbb644d301cbccbb44076501172bc8a532d386

Tesla weekly did break through the red bear channel resistance. This is the resistance if we use support from the October 3rd and 10th weekly candles and project it to the peak of the October 31st candle. However, there is also a blue bear channel using the peak of September 19th and October 31st candles. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h7nkv04st52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d18513a39dc8d9ff04be246612f0d1f6ed732b9

It would then make our weekly chart look like this. I personally put far more weight into the blue bear channel than I do the red bear channel. That would mean we actually did not break through resistance and have resistance pegged at that magical 185.3 level next week. If Tesla holds under that level all week then that is a rejection of the bear channel and should bring more down side. I am seeing a bullish reversal dragonfly doji candle formed here, however, we DID fail to close back over the daily 200ema. This daily 200ema next week could act as resistance and form a double top which would lead to further downside. 

Key support- 166.4 -&gt; 154.2

Key resistance- 192.9 -&gt; 207.2

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bo36u9ptt52a1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef8ba1b78bc7c3e30c79e1926b9e943141d926dd

The VIX is finally nearing that danger zone. That lower red highlighted channel of 19.7 to 16.5. Every time a “peak” on SPY has been put in the VIX has broken under 19.7 or touched it first. 

I am really eyeing a case of VIX touching 19.7 or below Monday or Tuesday this week with SPY rejecting 405-410 area and then come Wednesday through Friday we see a pretty large drop due to JPOW and the economic data coming out.

Another week of green here on the Challenge closing out with a net profit of $980 this week and total profits over the two weeks ive been running this challenge of $1740. 

**Daily log-**

Unfortunately I struggled this week quite a bit. However, my biggest losses came from once again holding too long. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cfisi5tut52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20de760d00def936f1d3ec68e15ae7538cc88422

Looking at my weekly analysis here I actually impressively hit 100% win rate on all my SPY scalps this week. Had a pretty mild profit between the normal scalps/ $5k scalps of $1980 this week. I only scalped a total of 7 times this week with 3 of those coming from today. I just didn’t see a lot of good setups this week for scalps and struggled finding a good read on the technical earlier in the week. 

Looking at my level to level plays this is actually the first week I believe in about 7 weeks of playing level to level/ swings that I have close out my week red for strictly the level to level plays. The biggest mistake this week was my stop losses on those. I started the week off with a pretty large -50% loss on Tesla. It had popped from about -40% to -25% and then immediately to -50% before I could really do much on a massive drop. I also took a put on FOMC minute day to -78% that had I mitigated my loss properly at -20% or the -5% right before minutes I would have actually ended my week green. I as I had said was FAR too bearish for FOMC minutes (which I think come Wednesday when JPOW speaks im going to find out I was right but market didn’t react that way) and burnt myself. 

I also took a pretty large loss on a SPX call overnight last night. I have not seen the IV crush the way it did on SPX/ SPY overnight. I know we had the holiday and everything but for SPY opening barely down 0.1% I believe it was and for my strike being the first strike OTM I was extremely shocked to see my position open -65%. I was able to get out around -60% but that one hurt a lot. I don’t think anyone who played anything (unless they sold options) won with a swing today. 

Morale of the story is I let my losers run more than I let me winners run. This week I failed to properly mitigate my losses and that was a big mistake and one I will continue to learn from next week. 

Overall closing out the week at a total -$594 which is not bad in all reality but it is still my first red week since the week of September 12th. Looking to get back on a good track Monday and get back on that green gain train. 

I hope everyone has a great weekend!

"11-21-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisThat was probably one of the worst days to trade that I have seen in months. The volatility and unpredictability of trading today was unmatched. I had extreme flash backs to June and July where SPY was so irrational it was untradeable. The pretty extreme low volume (we are 4 mil currently at this moment below the lowest volume day of the year) made for even harder trading today. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/86i6z821pd1a1.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc2b46bdf3129750ec66e8cd897cd477320f497a

This is where things continue to perplex me and I continue to struggle with what the fed is trying to do or say. Look at this years CPI YoY forecasts and actual readings. Since July 13th we have not had a single increase in CPI YoY. We have also not had a single CPI YoY forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting. Now we look at CORE CPI YoY and from August until October core was rising, however, last reading core decreased again. 

So we have the fed and mind you they’ve been saying “inflation is not under control” since at least July maybe August. But we are seeing inflation slowing… not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal… but with CPI YoY decreasing and CORE ranging from 5.9 to 6.6% with most of it being 5.9 to 6.3% I feel like there I just something the fed isn’t telling us. Or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound? I mean think about JPOW last FOMC what did he tell us? We was VERY clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature. Which means that almost all the fed members and even JPOW himself knows inflation isn’t under control. 

This next CPI and FOMC meeting will be very interesting to say the least. The case for a huge CPI miss is growing by the minute for me. However, we don’t have any consensus yet (investing.com says forecast but that really the consensus…. There is a TEforecast out but I find that inaccurate). There is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until CPI and FOMC. Which then perhaps CPI misses and FOMC remains bearish and we see this drop hard. 

Wednesday is FOMC minute day and we should get some more information from JPOW and what the fed members are thinking there. (I will release the FOMC minute trade play to the pre-market section tonight). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s5xi71r1pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdd25445934bf30c154e82ccfc8a3e4748237ae2

Last week I brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in. However, we are still showing bullish enough moves here. To not short this. 

The bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today (that was interesting) we are still holding that daily 8ema. That support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 394.7 to 398.5. Now mind you I really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 398.5 and actually touch that resistance… but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range. 

We closed yet again another doji on spy too. I am eyeing a possible carrot top (blue lines) formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema. While we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it. 

The issue we have here is this… buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25% of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls. While we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before CPI/ FOMC I feel like no one wants to go long here on calls. However, sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early. 

Bears aren’t ready to hard sell and bulls don’t want to keep buying. So we are left with this terrible chop. 

Key support- 394.7 -&gt; 390.1

Key resistance-398.5 -&gt; 401.3 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cd36vx92pd1a1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=396f25d3cd980dd3b7e8bd4dc9e4a0b67726cee2

Futures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart. Futures continues to hold 3960 support and remains under 4000 resistance. Looking at futures I actually see a clearer trend than I do on SPY. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ldx9cvo2pd1a1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=873731cea7a0a60e46380165c67173b12953c78f

I removed some of my trend lines here to make this look more clear. There is a nice diamond pattern forming here on Futures. This pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down. This pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/80xggb73pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64896086e827bf648afbf44f81a6aa1f7095f107

Out of curiosity I went back to SPY and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one. Support at 394 and resistance at 397.8 for tomorrow. 

Back to futures now.   
 key support- 3960 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3910  
 key resistance- 4000 -&gt; 4028

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6sf6qwq3pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5b39094fc909d3cd38857b8dc2c5d2f995d8d8e

Zooming out here first to show you the Tesla Daily and show you what lines goes where before we zoom in and chat about them. Focus on the bold dark green line here. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/04c1k964pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=764039f2470e44c4c265fe2272fe92ba88439d55

Now looking at the zoomed in daily you can see that Tesla actually did break through the daily support line for the green bear channel. This green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel. We are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in December. 

Interestingly enough about Tesla here is we have a red falling wedge, a red/ black falling wedge and a blue/ red falling wedge. Now People have been calling for a bounce since 204.8 and since the 234 rejection back on November 1st. 

This is where I struggle as it just seems Tesla cant quite catch a break. Had a bad news day on Friday and then again today (recalls I guess). The question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go? Or is this the easiest short of 2022? 

I want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… 

Sept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   
 Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  
 Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  
 Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  
 Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   
 Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  
 

Average # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  
 Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  
 Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  
 Average % for the pop= 11.81%  
 

so what does this tell us? 

Well being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. 

This also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. 

Looking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t9xsyts4pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eff94f8f4eac7e7a71196af9a9f8b3401b61ff1a

There was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… 

Lets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. 

That means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. 

To be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks.

Really tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. 

From there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. 

A red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. 

HOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… 

Anyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. 

People really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. 

Long story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them…. Do not be greedy!

"AMD AnalysisAMD; Should we see a break out of this downtrend soon?  


We have been stuck in a consistent down trend on AMD for about 3 months.

**On Feb. 25th, Biden Seeks $37B In Congressional Funding To Counter Chip Crisis.** This news may help us bounce back up to the resistance on the downtrend, and hopefully break it.

&amp;#x200B;

**For now, setting a target at the 89.00 range**; If we are green tomorrow, 1/2 size position would be acceptable.

We must break the short term resistance of this uptrend @ 87.00; only then will I feel confident to buy other 1/2.

&amp;#x200B;

**Seeing some small put options flow on this ticker, so be cautious and be aware of your own risk management.**

"9-14-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market AnalysisI said two things yesterday in my server and in my TA post/ video… 1. If you have profits at the end of a day… especially after some sort of wild 5th worst day for stocks in history type of day… you better secure profits. If you like the play still you can secure profits and open a new position size with profits. 2. I said that the #1 thing that makes people burn their rules and burn their accounts is when an outlier day (such as a straight trend day) happens and they expect that outlier to be the norm. It was not unexpected at all to see a consolidation and choppy day today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall the biggest fight today took place at 392 with the majority of big support bounces coming there and not a single 15min candle closing below it. However, we did retest 391 daily level support and failed to break through it. The one thing that is for sure is that 390-392 is one big wall that markets are not quite ready to see fail yet. 

Key support tomorrow will remain at 393 -&gt; 391 -&gt; 390.4 -&gt; 388.6 -&gt; 386.4. 

Key resistance tomorrow will remain at 395.4 -&gt; 397.8 -&gt; 400.5 à 401.9.

With this consolidation day not much has changed daily and weekly level wise. We still hold key support at 390 for the weekly and key resistance at 412.

Often times I look to ES futures for any hints of what might be to come on SPY, however, the charts are fairly mirror images with no new data to trade off of.

Key support- 3956 -&gt; 3930 -&gt; 3910 -&gt; 3868

Key resistance- 3980 -&gt; 4005 -&gt; 4030

Key weekly resistance remains at 4160 and key support at 3900.

Apple yet again today spent time trading under and over its daily 200ema now closing its 2nd day in a row below the daily 200ema. This is the first time there has been back to back candles closed below the daily 200ema since May. 

Major support is being established at this 153.8 to 154.5 level and major resistance is starting to form at 157.4. Today I did play a few plays based off the bounces here on support and resistance. Apple actually was a much better trade most of the day then SPY was. I was tempted to dabble in some tesla plays today too but withheld the temptation.

&amp;#x200B;

The VIX did a whole lot of nothing today seeing a mild decline and closing back below that key 26.9 level. The VIX is not going to work its way back down to test 25.5.. a break and closure below 25.5 would signal a potential bottom. 

For me while the VIX really has been disconnected from reality… I would not be positioning myself too long or too aggressively short until the VIX breaks and closes of 28. I also struggle going long on calls while VIX is over 25.5. 

&amp;#x200B;

So something to keep in mind that is happening this Friday is that it is Quad witching day. Ironically the last quad witching day on June 17th was the bottom and the low of the year so far. While the day itself was uneventful and pretty much just chopped all day and ranged it did put in a bottom and cause one heck of an impressive rally. 

If we look at March 18th quad witching day that also happens to coincide with a pretty impressive rally. Is it possible that Friday will be the “bottom” and we see a rally develop? 

If we think about it while the markets yesterday realized how screwed we are long term the fact that we did not dump today says a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qrkpf5d4lwn91.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e61ace70c012ad712b4f863131ee8e2574d11a8

Interestingly enough last night and at open today there was a 30-33% chance of a 100bps hike at the meeting on Sept 21st. However, you can see that the % chance has already declined to 25%. 

There is potential markets hella over-reacted thinking we get a 100bps hike, we consolidate in this 390-405 range until FOMC and when we do get the 75bps hike markets see a bit of a relief rally. There is no FOMC until November so there would be no more fear in the markets and the fear of a 100bps at next meeting wouldn’t really be a factor until next months CPI. 

Remember it is 100x harder for markets to sell off like yesterday and 100x more natural for market to trend up then down. Markets NEED a reason to sell… the question now is what is the reason… And what is that potential next catalyst you may ask? 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently there is a railroad strike that tomorrow would be the last day to “settle” it before Fridays cooling off strike period ends and we may see a world of hurt start. 

I feel like a lot of people fail to realize just how much cargo and liquids are transported by rail still in our country. This strike could potentially cause inflation and supply chain issues to get even worse than they already are. The markets very much so could negatively react to this. There were some sell offs today on news but so far the algos haven’t hooked up on much yet. 

10% challenge-

I had a really great day trading. I actually did the first 4 trades within the first hour of the markets opening which is not common for me. But lately the first hour has been really nice movements and technical and then the rest of the day much like today was just choppy trash not worth trading. 

I also played a few Apple options todays too. Apple as I mentioned above actually has been looking much smoother and better to trade then SPY has lately. I will look to continue to capitalize on Apple. 

Good day for me today hope you guys had a good day too.

"What’s Bad for AMZN is good for WISHYesterday, Lina Khan, a vocal critic of Amazon, was sworn in to lead the FTC at age 32. 

Khan played a crucial role as legal counsel for the House antitrust subcommittee’s 16-month investigation into the Big Tech giants, and in producing the 400-page House Democrat report that alleged that all of the tech giants engage in anti-competitive practices and need to be reined in.

Khan burst onto the scene in antitrust circles in 2017 when she penned a legal paper dubbed “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” which spread widely among proponents and critics alike.

The Federal Trade Commission also continues to probe various Amazon business practices to determine if Jeff Bezos’s corporation is violating antitrust laws.

"My thoughts on AMDThroughout the past year, I have been researching computer parts to build my own PC, and I’d say around just half a year ago, PC building subreddits and people in general recommended both AMD and INTC cpus for building a PC. Each had their pros and cons. However since the release of the new line of AMD CPUs, Id say for 95% or more of PC builds, people are recommending AMD cpus. In addition, they are gaining traction in the medium/high end gpu market. Before the release of their Ryzen 5700 gpu line, their medium/high end gpus were kind of a joke and people stuck with Nvidia. Now, AMDs top gpu (5700 XT) is a competitor with the 2070 super card and AMD in the CPU AND GPU market offers same or better performance compared to Intel and Nvidia at a MUCH better price. Especially seen in the CPU market.",1

"Will AMD hold $100? My analysisAMD is at a really interesting spot, especially when you look at its [price history](https://imgur.com/a/14exHYw) all the way back to $10 and below. 

As you can see, we got several clean bounces off of $10, $25, $50, $75 and perhaps now $100. These even steps dominate the weekly chart, looks extremely orderly to me compared to most stocks I've looked at. Right now it's balanced above the [downtrend that started at ATH](https://imgur.com/a/1UGyUPo), so a decision will be made very soon if it's gonna lose $100 or hold it and go higher. My theory is that the semiconductors were murdered a tad too much this week, and big money will take a second look at it over the weekend and scoop it. Especially since AMD is back down to this year's lows, and has already bounced cleanly off $100 on 1/28, 3/8 and 3/15. 

Not saying for sure it'll bounce, but it would be breaking it's trend of clean bounces going back 6+ years. Only exception was the 2020 crash at $50 which it clearly wanted to snap back from asap. Other than that it's only lost one of its key levels by no more than 3.1%. So this is an easy dip buy for me with a really good risk/reward ratio. Stop loss just below $96.9, so call it $96.5. Reward could be very good for a long-term hold or bounce to its 200sma around $118. What are your thoughts?",0

"SPY 2/7 The chop festWell this will probably be a shorter post because honestly not a whole lot happened today.... 

Today was the definition of flat/ sideways... my guess is the markets are not quite sure how to price in CPI data which drops thursday the 10th. POWELL said inflation is worse than we thought, however, CNBC was saying itll be 5% instead of 7%. Truly no one knows. However we did finish red and we do have a few things to continue to watch through the week. 

We are currently trading a symmetrical triangle (white solid lines) within a symmetrical triangle (red and blue dotted). 
https://i.imgur.com/BlZU8X9.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/sstIqGF.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/JHDhmnf.jpeg


As you can see we bounced between the white solid lined all day. And potentially we could see the same thing tomorrow 

Supports to watch- 446 (support of white triangle) --&gt; 443.5 (fridays low) --&gt; 439 (100 ema) --&gt; 436 (red dotted support line).

Resistance to watch- 448 (daily 5 ema) --&gt; 450 (resistance of white triangle) --&gt; 453.5 (daily 100 ema) --&gt; 455 (blue dotted resistance line/ daily 50 ema)

Overall like i said today was super flat and really unexciting. We dont really have any big catalysts to propel us upwards or send us spiraling downward until thursday when CPI drops in the morning (pretty sure its 8am).

I have moved my funds over to TOS but unfortunately to start trading options cash only they need the bank transfer to fully settle first. So i hope to be back trading thursday at the latest. 
- quite a few of you reached out today and shared their 5-10% wins for the day! Congrats guys on the first day of small gains beating yolo gains. 
- a couple reminders here... 
1. There may be days like today where there isnt a clear direction or a clear run that SPY is going on. If its flat and you dont think confidently you can make a 10% options trade. Sit the day out.
2. Some have mentioned they made 2 or 3 10% trades back to back today. Thats fine and nothing wrong with that. But dont get greedy by over trading. You can force a trade when you dont need to and be just as greedy as if you had just held the first
3. This challenge isnt for everyone and clearly some people dont understand what its all about. Everyone has a different risk tolerance. And everyone needs to do whats right for them and their families. Some may only be able to do 5% some 10% some 20%. 
4. I made it clear we never let the trade go red. But let me clarify that as there is some confusion. When you first enter you may initially be red momentarily. Its only to be down 5-10% for a few minutes. We may not always as much as we want to catch straight green. But what i meant by this is we never let a trade thats up 10, 20 or 30% finish red because we got so greedy and it turned fast on us. It happens unfortunately that we are right and made a great trade but there is an unexpected reversal. Have a stop loss. 
5. I mentioned a break even stop loss is better than red. Some didnt understand that. Yes being up 10% you probably should take profits and walk away. But if you really think its gonna go your way and really think its going to run. Set a breakeven stop loss and let it go. Of course if you were right and you get 15-20% up move that stop loss to 10%. This eliminates red days. 
6. This is a completely different approach than most people take which is why its getting so much flak. Most people who do options are 100% gambling. They see SPY had a red day and say yes man 10% OTM calls for tomorrow 0 dte for sure. Thats gambling not investing. We dont yolo. We make an informed and calculated move.

"Recap and the Game plan for the next 3 days. 8/19/22 Premarket outlook and Technical Analysis for day trading the SPY. 

Goodmorning traders, Lets recap the highlights from the premarket videos this week. Thursday; I said F\*\*K it, skew you and told you how skew was telling you to get ready for at least a 5 to 10% pullback and that we have pretty much done nothing all week and that Friday Move would be massive. Wednesday, I said' “I am starting to come around to the thought once this happens, we can start to see a near term top or the beginning of a pullback that will take 3 days to completely get started. Wednesday will be the reversal start into Thursday and Friday will be another steam roller bull rally, with a huge gap down on Monday.” Tuesday; I talked about how to avoid getting chopped up by the algo trading programs. So now if you were falling me, you were short coming into today. I am expecting close to a 3 deviation move today or spilling over into Monday.  I Expect internals to open pretty low, I won’t know exactly where until we open but I expect to roll some profits out by rolling out and down in some of my positions pretty early only to reposition myself back in hopefully above 426-426 depending on how market strength looks. I have shorts on in Apple, the QQQ and the Spy. I plan on rolling a portion of all of them so I can take some profit and keep some skin in the game. 

Key levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)425-426, (queen)427-428 and (king)429-435 area. Support (jack)423-422(queen)421-420 and (King)419-414. The main thesis is Bullish bias closing above 427.89 projected target/high of between 427-433. Alt thesis is Bearish bias closing below 427.89 projected target/low of between 424-418. The current major channel we are in is 425-453. When we open, the channel we will be in will be 425- 416. Early this week I talked about a splash back down into the previous channel... Splash.   Scenarios for the day: 

1) Trend day down we open gap down and start with a rally back toward the previous close. We find resistance on or before the previous close then begin the downtrend for the morning. We find midday chop around either possible queen or king support. It could feel like a trend day up with how big the gap is but until we get a reasonable close above the previous close. **40% probability** 

2) Rounded reversal day type structure. We could get a continued push lower toward jack or queen Support area and find midday chop around either queen or king support before spending the same energy we used going down to come back up the second half of the day or vice versa.  **31% probability** 

3)    Expanded Range Day structure We could look to set a decision area/ low boundary around the jack or queen resistance area before chopping back and forth then pushing the low boundary again. Then give us a big rally up to close the day.   Or vice versa **38% probability**",0

"Interactive Brokers just increased margin requirements for holding $TSLALooks like a lot of you dummies got margin called. Full letter below:

————————————————————————

Margin Increase - Tesla Inc.
 
 
Dear Client,

In light of the current trading environment, IBKR will be increasing the margin requirement for all Tesla Inc. (TSLA) products (Stock, Equity Options, Futures and CFDs).  The first in a series of margin increasing steps is scheduled for May 29, 2019.   

Trading accounts holding Stocks, Equity Options, Futures and CFDs should expect the margin requirement to increase to a minimum of 40%, up from its current level of 30%. Please note that in risk-based accounts other house margin charges may increase the margin requirement above the 10% indication. The increases will be implemented in a series of gradual steps over a 10-day period in order to allow traders to adjust their portfolios and/or capital positions accordingly.  As such, traders should plan on the minimum margin to increase 1% every day, starting after the US close on Wednesday, May 29, 2019, and concluding after the US close on Friday, June 7, 2019. 

As the effect of this change is portfolio-dependent, we strongly recommend that you review the impact of this change before its full implementation on Friday June 7, 2019, and arrange to have sufficient excess financial capacity to absorb the expected margin increases and take action, if necessary, to ensure margin compliance throughout the implementation period in order to avoid liquidations  

To evaluate the impact of this change on your portfolio, please utilize IBKR's Risk NavigatorSM to understand how margin will change based upon the current holdings in your portfolio, as well as to determine the margin requirement for any portfolio that you may elect to construct/test. To evaluate the impact of this proposed change on your margin requirements, please see KB2957 and, from the margin mode setting, select ""TSLA Margin 20190607"".

Consistent with our stated policy, an account that is unable to carry the positions under these new margin requirements will be subject to liquidation in order to bring the account into margin compliance.",0

"10-17-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisAfter a much needed vacation im back in the saddle and hit the ground absolutely running today! Great day in the server despite this wonky day. Looking at last weeks price action I would not have suspected SPY to open 2% green today an hold green all day long. However, CNBC is once again despite the terrible CPI CORE readings and CPI in general that the fed will pause/ pivot in December… Seems like they are doing everything they can to push this market into another July type rally.

We also just EOD had another phantom range hit the books. I have never ever seen this many phantom ranges hit the books like this before. I really don’t know how to take these. At first it was a guaranteed hit but now we are seeing that not really the case. We still have the untouched/ fill phantom print from October 7th at 373.29. Now we currently have todays phantom bottom at 357.28. Its odd to say the least. 

&amp;#x200B;

Spy currently is trading within that grey sideways channel which is 356.5 to 378.2 with the main price action happening between 356.5 and 368.7. I believe which ever one of these breaks first will be the way we push. Todays price action actually looked extremely similar to October 3rd and 4th. 

What we saw today was VOLD green pretty much 98% of the day (a handful of red candles) and in extreme bull momentum all day but SPY didn’t push up with it. Spy held the same about $2 range from 1145am till EOD.

We have two different downward channels a red one and a black one. We also are forming a falling wedge with the red bear channel support and black bear channel resistance. 

Overall im bearish under 368.6 with VIX over 31. If those conditions change tomorrow I may start looking for some upside. We are hitting earnings right now with a few decent names this week but most next week. That will be interesting to see how those play out in the market. 

Key support- 364 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.4

Key resistance- 368.6 -&gt; 370.8 -&gt; 373.2 -&gt; 378.4

Futes is in an overall downward channel that’s black and blue. Currently that black and blue channels also form a falling wedge which we are holding beneath and it also lines up with the key daily 20ema resistance line. 

The biggest bullish thing for today depending on where futes close is that they are holding over and will close over 3680 resistance. Key resistance is that black resistance at 3695 for tomorrow.

Apple has a nice blue falling wedge forming and actually is holding its sideways channel of 138 to 142.4. I will be looking at the falling wedge and key levels of that channel before I decide which way markets going to go. For a lot of today it seemed like once again Apple looked weak while the general markets were propping everything up. 

Looking at the last 3 days of price action on Apple it actually does appear to be forming a daily bear flag. 

Key support- 138 -&gt; 134.9

Key resistance- 142.5 (blue falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 144.3 -&gt; 146 (black bear channel)

Tesla is one that I struggle with. So looking at its chart Friday we had a massive full on bearishly engulfing candle. That SHOULD have led to further downside on Tesla today. However, it put in a pretty massive green inside day. The thoughts would be this was a relief bounce that did reject the daily 8ema and still is holding under black bear channel resistance. With earnings this week we could see Tesla move outside of the technical. 

Key support- 215 -&gt; 205 -&gt; 196.1

Key resistance- 220 (black bear channel resistance) -&gt; 224.4 -&gt; 233.7

Despite all these media narrative or fed pausing and bullish rally to SPX 4000… until the VIX breaks through this bull channel its in which is bounced off support of today I will not be playing calls. Will be watching the VIX closely this week for a break down in order to flip long. 

Key level tomorrow is 31.1. we are still trading in the orange 28.4 to 33 channel which also is a bigger indication of where we could be headed next. 

10% challenge-

Overall after a great week last week and with a small 3 day vaca away form markets I was happy to jump back into the markets with a great day today.

"Time to Buy a Real Stock : AMD (Kill The Shorts Part 2)I know we’ve had our fun with GME and I’m sure it still has a shot to go up. However, let me re-introduce you to a real stock: **AMD**. 🚀🚀

At $88 a share, we’re looking at massive upside. And instead of buying GME at $83, why not buy something that actually has some long term value? Oh and did I mention it’s one of the most shorted stocks this month? [https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks)

**That’s $6.7 billion in short interest.** That’s larger than the actual current market cap of GME. Let’s actually make a dent here. These fuckers **added 17% more shorted shares** in the last month. You're gonna tell me their diamond hands are better than OUR DIAMOND HANDS 💎💎💎?

As our savior Elon Tweeted today : “I am become meme, destroyer of shorts.”

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993)

Let’s make him proud.

Ok, now for some DD so you guys know I’m not talking out of my ass.

# Fundamentals:

Their latest ER:

**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**

**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**

Server revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible because that means they are actually going toe to toe with the big boys like IBM.

Massive increase in guidance. They’re **expecting 37% growth** this year.

So why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let’s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.

Obviously, we’d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you’re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, “hey we have too many orders and we can’t keep up sorry, we’ll get it to you ASAP”

Imagine thinking this company isn’t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.

Our queen, Lisa Su, said “there will be added capacity” in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they’ll be good to go. I wouldn’t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.

**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**

Intel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!

**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.

**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.

# Technicals:

For those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.

We really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we’re basically there right now.

In addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47

For more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.

# Conclusion/TLDR:

My point is that more than half of you fuckers run AMD in your machine anyway and the other half is waiting for their stimulus check to buy the new Ryzen series. The new investors here are all sad from GME, but now it’s time to put your big boy pants on and get into something that has some real value behind it. You got questions? Leave em in the comments and I’ll answer.

"$SPY - Predictions for the week of 4/11Last week I said that SPY was going to slope down with nothing crazy, that happened except my 5 day forecast got inversed.  The days that I thought would be bearish were actually bullish.  

I was thinking about this, and noticed how there is hundreds of ways the week could play out - that would result in SPY going down.  

I am still going to continue the 5 Day Outlook because it is something funny to do, just take it with a grain of salt because it is seriously impossible to predict every single day before the futures market even opens... I write these Saturday morning.

The main levels have been the same for about a month now

Support \~432

Resistance \~452

The RSI is showing the %K approaching an oversold reading, there will at least be a short term relief in the selling pressure overall

I would classify the bollinger band with as a somewhat mean reverting indicator to get a sense of the overall volatility.  Since the bollinger bands have a relative wide span we can assume that we will likely be entering a phase of lower volatility.

Everyone is going to be watching the CPI data when it is released on Tuesday.  Remember that Ukraine was invaded February 24th so all of the effects on the global markets were felt last month in March.  

All retail investors will be watching, and all of Wall Street will be watching.  This is not going to be pretty...

I saw this chart floating around that shows a historical trend line of the major economic recessions in the United States and how they correlate to to the 10Y yield.

I was looking around and can conclude that the 30 Year bond Yields have more variation but are a better indicator for timing the end of an economic cycle.  There is nothing to be done now, I am just waiting.  I still have a lot of positions open, when this crash starts I will start to liquidate everything... believe me it will be very noticeable when it starts.

Bullard is concerned for the economy and wants at least a 50 to 75bp rate hike.  I actually found this kind of interesting because he is one of the least corrupt people in office.  He has a net worth around 5 million which is surprisingly low for having inside information.  He also has never worked with big banks, and he also assumed office at the top of the 2008 financial bubble when everyone else was leaving their positions.  He definitely knows what is going on and what needs to be done to save the economy.  The federal reserve will eventually have to become more aggressive in rate hikes.

**Predictions**

Tuesday is going to be an extremely important day.  I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10%.  Oil rose 35% in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5% which is going to shock the markets.  

Another factor, is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession, but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.  

The amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day, even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.

I hate to be that person, but, over the last year with unemployment decreasing, spending increasing, and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80% without interfering.  At most there will be a 50% bear market similar to 2008.

The stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell, then it should recover in the following days.

 \* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more

"Ascending Triangle on Spy | My Trade Plan For Spy Tomorrow 8/19/22&amp;#x200B;

[Spy](https://preview.redd.it/dbz3eyvnrki91.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5976ffcfc0fa72cc57413669faa37a886758c0a)

What a beautiful trend line we have on spy these past two days, creating a nice ascending triangle that looks prime for a move regardless of the direction because of how coiled we have been the past two days. My plan will consist of two trade ideas, depending on which direction is broken first and retested, I will be buying calls (if the break is to the upside) and puts if to the downside.

The Long 

\- We break and retest 428.30, (prior top of today), my target area will be 429.50, I plan to keep on a runner incase we break the high of this week.

The Short

\- We break the ascending triangle and trap all the people trading off the trend line, this level for me will be 427.40, a retest of the area once broken and I will be in puts, my cover area will be 425 (the low area of this consolidation)",0

"713 Free Shares of SPY from E*TRADEE\*TRADE accidently sent me 713 additional shares of SPY roughly a month after an account transfer to a CHASE investing account. What should my course of action be here? they've sent a message about a reclaim request from E\*TRADE but need my approval to initiate it.

My E\*TRADE account is now showing a short position of 713\~ shares of SPY from the shares sent to my CHASE account. However, this account has never had margin enabled, nor have I ever had that much in SPY within that account. With that, I would assume this position was a manual input upon the realization of the error on their side.

So, with hard work and researching online, I came up with this formation. The female reproductive system. As we all know, women bleed out of their vagina during their periods and the color of blood is red. The current market currently looks like the female reproductive system so in conclusion, I think it will bleed the same since it look alike.

"PREDICTION: AAPL will acquire INTC’s modem division/IPThis is 75% me hoping I still have a job, but hear me out:

Apple’s known to be [opening a new office in San Diego](https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/apple-to-add-more-jobs-at-new-san-diego-tech-hub) to work on modems. While most news outlets have been reporting this is in Qualcomm’s backyard, it’s also in Intel’s backyard - Intel’s modem division (iCDG) is based out of SD.

Now that [Intel is exiting the 5G smartphone business](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-modem-statement/), this allows Apple to swoop in and acquire the entire group, fast-tracking Apple’s modem development. This deal with Qualcomm has bought Apple a six-year lifeline to develop their own modems, but six years may not be enough.

I’m sure you’re thinking “six years is plenty of time to make their own!” but modem development is not as simple as it sounds. Not only will Apple need to develop their own LTE/5G/NR modem, they will still need to support legacy RATs like 2G/3G/CDMA - not a trivial task. Why pour billions into R&amp;D to develop legacy tech, when they can just acquire? Intel’s key customer has been Apple anyway, so both groups are familiar with working together and each other’s methodology.

With Apple partnering with Qualcomm for the near future, but also trying to build their own modem, there‘s a risk for cross-contamination and more lawsuits, so acquiring Intel’s modem division and operating them as their own unit would also alleviate these fears.

The only hiccup is Intel has specified they are only giving up *smartphone* 5G development. Would they be willing to give up their 5G IP even though they’re still probably planning on putting 5G into laptops? Or will they come out and admit they’re giving up on 5G modems all-together?

&gt; As a result, Stein adjusted his price targets for several key semiconductor stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices (ticker: AMD ), Intel ( INTC ), and Nvidia ( NVDA ). His new price target for AMD is $111, down from $144, while Intel’s target was cut to $49 from $53. He retained a Hold rating on both the stocks.

Thiel has been with Facebook nearly from the beginning and has been credited with a lot of their strategic succes.

How will Meta do without their lead strategist who is now linked to Trump.

"6-21-22 SPY Daily TaWelcome to another 4 day week! Today we saw a big gap up followed by a morning breakout and then the usual sideways chop the rest of the day. 

https://preview.redd.it/u2mo8neya1791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26ed77db6033ad65c93f35dc63c5819ac80afe63

The 15min does have a nice little bull channel forming that I will be surprised if we maintain due to how tight it is. 

https://preview.redd.it/1eyob11za1791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5382fdea1a8193536cef257ed1b2cfaa3aab2999

The daily is actually quite interesting as you can see we actually now gapped up on the daily leaving a gap from 369.38 to 371.81. Its not much but its there and we closed the lower gap from 370.94 to 372.12 from June 15th open. 

The biggest takeaway for me from todays close is that we saw the June 13th support of 375 actually act as resistance today with closing. It looks like TV adjusted close to 375.07 but before it was 374.95. Overall to me with the VIX back over 30 and SPY back to 375 this was a fairly bearish close. I think this was a low volume breakout attempt at barely 75mil and that we will see red the rest of the week. 

https://preview.redd.it/cwgtvumza1791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e57526ea336f3f1a735365618cb1c2b4a253b97

The VIX attempted to break down today but stayed locked around that 29.8 to 30 level almost all day long. The main reason I am not sold on the bear market rally continuing is that the fear in the market did not unwind enough… had we been able to get VIX closer to 28 or below it I would be sold but right now we are stuck near 30. I don’t really think we see upside tomorrow. 

https://preview.redd.it/dbsl95i0b1791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=862999a483f7869c8e9aea4a9561011dbff23d8e

EOD we also broke through the June 16th and June 17th resistance line so there is a case to be made we see much more upside on the VIX. 

https://preview.redd.it/wlf5xg21b1791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4eea96b67954bb4d8a3f2120844402a9fac3eaef

Tomorrow morning we also get JPOW himself testifying on monetary policy. This should be VERY interesting to not only listen to but see what the markets react with. The best part is it starts at 930am at market open. These hearings usually last almost all day too. 

With PMI Thursday and UMICH sentiment on Friday I have a really hard time believing in a rally this week. At best I would think we see a 365-375 consolidation. 

10% challenge-

I had a great day today day trading, probably one of my best “Mondays” in a while. But obvious its Tuesday. I unfortunately had something come up with the family and had to disappear for most of the afternoon but I was still able to get some good trade in this morning and one UVXY trade EOD.

https://preview.redd.it/7mnw0sj1b1791.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c852c67629ff805f40c9f99a8a51366f67bc60f7

Overall today was a great start to the week. 

I am holding onto my 3dte 362P still. I considered averaging down today before market close but decided to enter a UVXY call instead. I have better faith in a VIX spike tomorrow with the testimonies than I do SPY actually dumping. 

Current breakeven is near 362 tomorrow for this put which is about -3.6% tomorrow. Of course with a big enough IV pump from the VIX and what not we may see that be close to 363-364. I felt it was worth holding these puts till Friday which come Friday my breakeven is near 358 (-4.7% total from todays close). 

I decide to play some UVXY calls overnight for the testimony and expectation the VIX will head back near 32 tomorrow.

"Getting Technical: SPY DD(10/2/19)Drill Spy the Buy Puts Guy here with some technical analysis on $SPY in preparation for Wedneaday, October 2nd. 

*Safety glasses on*
.
On October 1st, $SPY(-1.19%) saw it's biggest one day drop in over a month off of weak manufacturing news.  President Tariff Man's outlook on trade talks has changed to a much more negative tone the past few tweets, and it seems the impeachmeant news has him thrown off his stonks game. 

    If he can regain his focus and use his tweets to pump efficiently, we may see SPY rebound by the EOW, but as of now, he seems more focused on attempted pumps on auto stocks nobody gives a fuck about. Unless Trump regains his true bull self, expect SPY to continue it's downtrend for the week considering there has been literally zero positive political or economic news this week. In other words, the stock market is ON FUCKING FIRE. 

As for October 2nd, look for $SPY  to rally at open. If it breaks 294.25 early, expect a flat-to-mildly green day, before a big drop the rest of the week. On the opposite side, if we break through 293.00 on the downside, expect all hell to break loose and $SPY to close around 290. 

In conclusion, barring Tariff man going full Bull Gang, expect another red day tomorrow because there is absolutely no fucking reason for a green day at all. Buy puts motherfuckers cause SPY is gonna DRILL! DRILL! DRILL!

*Safety Glasses off*

TLDR: $SPY is gonna DRILL! DRILL! DRILL! tomorrow. Buy puts it is free fucking money.",1

"Long $AMD, Massive Intel In-Hardware Security Bug Found (Hotfix Requires -30% Perf Penalty)You faggots doubted SuBae, but her journey to the moon is undaunted by your cum-guzzling ways. 

Confirmed homosexual firm, $INTC, will be announcing [a massive in-hardware security bug in its modern processors that will require a **-30% performance penalty** to hotfix it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/intel_bug_incoming/). This will notably affect large datacenter customers such as $GOOG and $AMZN (short them for maximum tendies). 

* As an in-hardware bug, this is not easy to fix and will require a brutal hotfix as a temporary measure. A less destructive fix will not be available until the hardware is replaced with updated models in the coming years (as if customers would choose to buy more $INTC products after this!). 

* The bug is currently under embargo much like $INTC is still officially in the closet. In the coming days, $INTC will publicly acknowledge its sexual orientation and the existence of this bug. 

* [$INTC's CEO sold off $11M of $INTC stock less than two weeks ago](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/19/intels-ceo-just-sold-a-lot-of-stock.aspx) and now holds the bare minimum number of shares required by the CEO according to $INTC by-laws. Looks like he's getting his yacht while he still can! 

* Competing processors made by SuBae are confirmed to not be affected by this vulnerability as their architecture is much girthier. 

This leaves **SuBae poised to fuck the competition up the ass** on large datacenter contracts. 

* $AMD has recently [ramped up production on their 32-core ""EPYC"" CPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12032/amd-announces-wider-epyc-availability-and-rocm-17-with-tensorflow-support) that competes in the datacenter market. 

* Not only does the 32C EPYC have more cores than $INTC's flaccid 28C CPU, but [EPYC costs half as much](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11544/intel-skylake-ep-vs-amd-epyc-7000-cpu-battle-of-the-decade/10). 

* SuBae is rumored to release an [EPYC 2.0 with an even more turgid 64-core CPU as early as 2019](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-2-64-cores-128-threads-and-256mb-l3-cache). 

 * Impotent traitor, [Raja Kodorki, is confirmed to not be involved with Epyc in any way](http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-boss-raja-koduri-joins-intel-to-work-on-integrated-and-discrete-graphics/) and will only be adding performance issues to $INTC products going forward. 

* SuBae won't rest until EPYC is packed deep into datacenters everywhere, leaving $INTC frustrated and on the streets to beg for tendies. 

I see **$AMD trading at $15 by weeks end**. It's yacht time, faggots. ",1

I’ve been trading for years and have also stuck to longer timeframes trades , generally on the daily or weekly

We have reached a point of a perfect short on SPY known as divergence

Where we have a confirmed 3rd touch on trend and a divergence on the stochastic letting us know that we are too “overbought” to keep it simple

The same thing happened back in Jan for our first major drop of $470 to $420

Then again on March where we went from $460 to $385

And now again at $430 where target would be between the range of $324-$365

Real target would actually be $325 looking at market structure and comparing the recent drops from high trend touches

I’m out of all positions on my account and have switch to MARA and SPY Puts

So amazon got a ton of cash from raising their prime subscriptions and getting paid up-front for them, but this doesn't get recorded as revenue for Q2.  Could this be a major factor in beating EPS but missing revenue?

"My thoughts on AMDThroughout the past year, I have been researching computer parts to build my own PC, and I’d say around just half a year ago, PC building subreddits and people in general recommended both AMD and INTC cpus for building a PC. Each had their pros and cons. However since the release of the new line of AMD CPUs, Id say for 95% or more of PC builds, people are recommending AMD cpus. In addition, they are gaining traction in the medium/high end gpu market. Before the release of their Ryzen 5700 gpu line, their medium/high end gpus were kind of a joke and people stuck with Nvidia. Now, AMDs top gpu (5700 XT) is a competitor with the 2070 super card and AMD in the CPU AND GPU market offers same or better performance compared to Intel and Nvidia at a MUCH better price. Especially seen in the CPU market.",1

"9-13-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market AnalysisWell lets go ahead and get this out of the way… yes I bought calls over night and yes I was hella wrong. Inflation had peaked per CPI as I expected coming in a 8.3% vs. 8.5% previous, however, market honed in on year over year and month over month core. Year over year core had not gone up since April this year. I took a calculated risk with the information I had and honestly with what I knew then I woulda made the same play. Win some you lose some… this is why plays like that should be small in size. 

The worst part is prior to the bullish pop last week in the market I was bearish going into the CPI meeting and was expecting a dump. Got shaken out and bull trapped with the lower then expected consensus and forecast… the psyops continue. 

Anyways moving on! Today was the worst day in the markets since the June 2020 the Covid crash.

Today was the 5th largest daily point loss in the whole history of the S&amp;p500. 

So lets take a second and lets think about WHY we sold off so aggressively. 

Going into today markets knew (it was bout a 91% chance) that we would get a 75bps hike and they THOUGHT that inflation would peak. This morning markets realized inflation did not peak (per core), the 75bps rate hike might not be enough to fight inflation so a 100bps hike could be needed, and they are also accepting more and more that a soft landing is not going to happen. 

Markets are not in a rock and a hard place. They were previously rallying on news that few were going to pivot (July to august run) and then Jackson hole slapped markets to reality that was not going to happen. However, markets were feeling pretty bullish going into this CPI. Now that markets realize there is nothing to be bullish about this is where things get interesting. 

Is this the start of a capitulation like sell off we saw in June around that CPI (remember it dropped 10.3% in 3 days) or was this a massive market over-reaction to a potential 100bps rate hike that was not even mentioned to begin with?

Today we broke down and opened below the 405.2 daily resistance level and didn’t quite make it to that 390 level. We have not broken back below the red dotted support line using the June low and sept 6th low for support. 

We are looking at a potential blue bear channel which gives EOW support near 380 (-3.4%) or the black bear channel which gives a deeper sell off of 362 (-8%). 

The one thing that is for sure is that we broke through the v shaped recovery support and the next major support test comes at 390.5. This is where I suspect if the bulls are going to put up a fight that it happens. However, if we are to close a candle in the 380s tomorrow or later this week then it would appear we could be in a bigger sell off until FOMC. 

Key supports tomorrow- 391.1 -&gt; 390.5 -&gt; 388.5 -&gt; 386.8 -&gt; 382 -&gt; 368.3

Key resistance tomorrow- 395.3 -&gt; 400.4 -&gt; 402

SPY weekly is starting to show more and more of this current black weekly downward channel. Key support comes at 390.4 and 380. With key resistance at 412.

Looking at the futures daily ES candle this is a 3 day long bearish engulfing candle. Pretty impressive regardless of what side you ended up on today. 

Black bear channel gives EOW support at 3620 while blue bear support comes in more mildly at 3825.

Key supports tomorrow- 3908 -&gt; 3867 -&gt; 3840 -&gt; 3830

Futures weekly in a nice downward channel but same thing its not breached its weekly support recovery line yet.

Apple with a pretty incredible breakdown today hitting -6% briefly at points. The biggest take away on Apple is that it did break through its red dotted support line from the June recovery. In addition it closed back below the daily 200ema and closed lower then any of the candles last week during the sell off. 

Black bear support line comes in at 139 and blue bear support comes in at 148 for the EOW potential targets. 

Key supports tomorrow- 151.5 -&gt; 148.7 -&gt; 149.4 -&gt; 147

Key resistance tomorrow- 157.4 -&gt; 159.9

Unlike SPY (thanks to apples huge 4% day yesterday) there is no gap left on the daily chart.

In terms of bearish and clean looking charts this apple weakly chart does look extremely clear in what trend we are clearly in with a break in the weekly support line. 

Key support- 150.2 -&gt; 148.8

Key resistance- 157.5 -&gt; 161

The VIX is where things are going to get a little interesting. You can see how many times we have found ourselves over this 26.9 level but unable to push any higher. There is an obvious reason to suspect we are still in a bullish channel up on the VIX, however, previous to today that channel was breaking down and we were trending clearly back under 25.5. 

While a 14.33% green move on the VIX is big when we look at other VIX days from this year we have plenty of 20%+ moves on the VIX. There was even part of the day today where the vix showed weakness and had even broke back below 25.5 before the EOD push up on the VIX and down on SPY.

Key level to watch tomorrow for the VIX is 28.3 and 26.8. I am wondering with how disconnect the VIX has been from reality and the markets since really the June lows if we could see a major sell off on the markets without getting the vix back to 35-40.

Yes my call was worthless… yes it sucked. Yes it woulda been 1.6k turned into 36k+ had it bought puts… it is what it is… youll drive yourself mad in this market going what if this and what if that. 

I made some pretty good progress intraday today recovering those losses tho. 

My biggest lesson once again after going long on puts last week only to get shaken out at a -70% loss (yes those would be up 10.9% EOD today had I held…) and being bullish prior to today (thankfully didn’t act on any plays besides those swing calls)… day trading for me is 100000X more effective then swing trading has ever been for me.

"An ETF idea similar to SPY and QQQI was curious if such an ETF exists where exposure is inversely proportional to the market cap of a company chosen from top 100 companies, instead of direct proportionality like in SPY and QQQ.

The  idea is based on the premise that the companies with highest market cap have lesser growth potential than small/mid cap companies. But companies with small/mid cap have higher risk.  An intermediate idea would be to take top N (say 100) companies to reduce risk and then try to maximize gains assuming lowest cap from these N will grow more than largest cap.

So, if we take the set of top 100 companies in NASDAQ and form an ETF with inverse proportionality to market cap, how does it perform over years?

Let

M1 :  Market cap of largest company

M2 :  Market cap of second largest company 

.

.

.

so on

Let M = Sum  (1/M1 + 1/M2+ ...)

Let us call the ETF as ETF-X.

Percentage of M1 in ETF-X  = (1/M1)/ M

Percentage of M2 in ETF-X = (1/M2)/M

... 

Instead of usual for QQQ as M1/(M1+M2+...)

"Elon Musk's Twitter Acquisition is a Head Fake to Sell $10 Billion of His $TSLA Stock on RetailCould it be that Elon Musk never intended to buy Twitter and instead, used the proposed acquisition as a narrative to dump $10 Billion in Stocks on retail? 

Elon Musk predicted a recession 6 months ago on Twitter. Elon Musk is cash poor. At that very moment, he may have concieved an evil genius plan to fake a purchase of Twitter to create a liquidity exit narrative for $8 Billion in $TSLA and $2 Billion in SpaceX equity to prevent crashing the price of his companies. 

He knew from day 1 about the Twitter Bot situation and called Twitter out on their bluff knowing that a large % of their user base are bots. From day 1, Elon Musk had a perfect exit plan in place to bail on the deal with 0 repercussions and walk away with $10 Billion in cash and look like Hero.

"Walking Away [USD] [AAPL]There’s as much political capital to use the *R* word as there is for austerity. None. Not from the party in power, not from the media that supports them, not from the institutions that need liquidity, or from central banks. Make no mistake, the previous president was a nightmare as well, and beyond symbolism, and symbolic legislation, did absolutely nothing but add to the national debt. That debt stands at $30T. That’s why the US government, the USD, and Federal Reserve are trapped in a corner with no way out. This is the Doom Vortex of the *Triffin Dilemma*, and more or less the end of the USD. If you raise rates say 1%, the interest on that is $300B annually. But inflation is set to break 10% (CPI). The below chart is a parabola. This is the absolute last thing you'd want to be doing in a high inflation environment with commodities surging and the demand for USD dwindling.

I wrote about the *Doom Vortex* and the dangers of sanctions which are symbolic, and about the coming shortages, immigration crisis, and exploitation by China as a non-sanctioned nation here.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tv7ym1/doom\_vortex/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tv7ym1/doom_vortex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

A bear market is defined as any decline of 20% or more in the general market. We’ve had 9 such declines since 1950. After a 20% decline (which we have not had yet), the average bear market lasts 289 days.

Ultimately it will be taxes that have to be raised. Remember you’re the ones that pay taxes, not corporations or billionaires who can lever debt. Corporations made up 7% of federal tax receipts last year. That means corporate taxes are ripe to get hiked along with digital asset taxes, capital gains taxes, etcetera. That’s likely where the GOP makes huge inroads with voters going into our elections this fall. Speaking of politics, anybody see France’s far-right candidate *Marine Le Pen’s* sudden surge in the polls against Macron? An insane upset in that election would send absolute shockwaves through the EU that you cannot imagine. If that happened only a month into the Ukraine War when the biggest fallout from it (shortages, immigration surge, inflation) has not been fully absorbed, it’s difficult to imagine an EU that would survive intact because I watched the last time immigration in an economy of plenty brought Brexit and a new political class to Europe. Imagine immigration 5x as bad in an economy of shortages, and rolling blackouts.

This is natural gas futures. This isn't going to last long before things stop wobbling and start breaking:

So what does this mean for markets? It means a wipe-out. It means the type of capitulation that proffers generational buying opportunities. I see it as more than this, in fact; I see it as a redistribution of wealth, blood on the streets style. My nephew who uses FBA to sell products on Amazon with margins of about $1, has already had to raise the product price 20% to make the same amount of money but his sales volume has plummeted. If he continued selling at the previous price, he'd be losing money with each item. That's an anecdotal and seemingly irrelevant example, but my point is that the weakest will get squeezed first and our economy IS NOT designed for oil over $95. The entire thing has adapted around certain energy input costs like our evolutionary biology has oxygen.

Look at the trucker tender reject index above... This is up exponentially from last year. This reading is actually worse than every recession on record.

This all sets the stage for the coming food crisis late summer into fall which I talked about in the Doom Vortex post. It'll destabilize the Middle East, and send a deadly wave of immigration into Turkey and Western Europe. Fertilizer price index:

We'll look back and see that the bear market started in in November 2021, and was confirmed in April (or May) of 2022 with the 20% down breach. Then we'll look back and see the recession started early in 2022.

My prediction is that the Turkish Lira continues its hyper-inflationary moves, and goes bust in the next 12 months. That's dangerous because of the inbound immigration issues nobody is seeing play out. They'll be left with the choices of either moving closer towards China (an emerging debtor nation who can proffer money and commodities), or to sacrifice their children at the IMF altar, hoping its SDR (special drawing rights) has enough inputs to float them past outrageous fortune. Either way, they'll be giving away huge concessions. Or they can choose the digital gold pathway, which will cause all types of trouble early, and then later because digital gold over a long enough time period completely demonetizes the political class; but it makes sovereign citizens and the scarcity in the money leads to an abundance of everything else, meaning it would be great for the people at large. Turkey is a strategically located country in geographical terms, and has an enormous manufacturing base. The former is why it's so valuable to China, so EU would be willing to overspend to keep them in the fold, putting evermore pressure on the Euro. Money machine go *brrrrr*.

Lastly here's a thought experiment with an anecdotal example:

Assume that Starbucks made an NFT large latté. This NFT latté was exchangeable for a real latté at any Starbucks location. That latté is $5. But now assume that this NFT latté could be held on any non-custodial wallet in the world, which you could spend it from, and Apple integrated spending of such tokenized securities from ApplePay. Ok, but now assume there are DeFi marketplaces for these, meaning I can swap that latte for a Big Mac, some doughnuts, or sell it for digital gold, HODL it, or gift it, take a loan on it, etcetera. Assume any trade of such tokenized securities cost less than a penny, settled instantly, and moved at the speed of light. Why would anybody hold USD (and thusly stablecoins) when they could hold these globally? Why not hold the NFTs instead ? Because they'll keep pace with inflation. Assume the network these all travel on can eliminate the 4% charged by Amex, Visa etcetera. That chargebacks dropped 50%. Refunds were instant. Settlement was instant. Global restrictions were gone. Liquidity could be acquired instantly, and it offered a revolutionary way to advertise like Facebook did a decade ago. That's the Lightning Network's future, and it's not good for banks, remittance, card processors, stablecoins, or paper money.

Judgement:

* Exit this market tomorrow. If you don't own digital gold, then get off zero. HODL until you see generational buying opportunities in stocks (indices at least 30% down).
* If you're a newb who taught himself to trade during the lockdowns, fancy yourself a Gordon Gekko with his Robinhood app, and have never blown up an account yet, at least have the sense to sell calls on your positions to limit the damage.
* If you're a bear, you'll be fine, just don't go more than 1.5x leverage. Volatility will smack you around but you'll always get closer to the capitulating bees' honey.
* If you're a meme bro, then you're a gambling junkie masquerading as an investor and will go broke over time regardless of what you do. Just have fun doing it.

Lastly:

If a credit market develops around digital gold because it surprises everybody and becomes less volatile than most fiat (already is more stable than Turkish Lira), and it has low rates for borrowers, this can be a straw that breaks the camels back.

"Spy to $325 in 60 Dayshttps://youtu.be/WeeNpwQ713I

I’ve been trading for years and have also stuck to longer timeframes trades , generally on the daily or weekly

We have reached a point of a perfect short on SPY known as divergence

Where we have a confirmed 3rd touch on trend and a divergence on the stochastic letting us know that we are too “overbought” to keep it simple

The same thing happened back in Jan for our first major drop of $470 to $420

Then again on March where we went from $460 to $385

And now again at $430 where target would be between the range of $324-$365

Real target would actually be $325 looking at market structure and comparing the recent drops from high trend touches

I’m out of all positions on my account and have switch to MARA and SPY Puts

MARA $15 Puts for October
SPY $420 Oct Puts and $430 Nov Puts

Will be buying more Puts on SPY for late October Sometime this upcoming week

"CPI day is here and here’s how I think it should play out. 8/10/22 Premarket outlook and Technical Analysis for day trading the SPY. 

&amp;#x200B;

Goodmorning traders, CPI Day is here and here is how I think it should play out. First thing to notice is that we started with an expected move of +/-8.825 for the week, two days have passed and today’s expected move is still over half the weekly’s expected move. This is saying we are going to have a heck of a range today (big move alert). Second, we had a gap down on internals from yesterday that we did not cover so there is still some upside risk coming into today. Technically, the weekly timeframe is the chart in control and based on that chart there appears to still be room to go up. Even though I see room to go up on the weekly it's not much which means the Room to go up could be filled by going sideways being that we are in consolidation mode or rest area for the weekly time frame. I am still not letting go of 418-421 level just yet. The Cpi Could be the boost or last gas effort to get up there. The daily chart is overbought but isn’t quite ready to fall out of bed just yet. Although it is headed down out of overbought territory it has a rest area or consolidation zone to go thru first and with the MACD still on the positive momentum and trend side it's likely we have a last-ditch effort waiting to go back to the upside before a complete breakdown. The 4-hour chart is next up in the rotation and is at the lower part of its range ready to cycle back up and retest the top of the most recent range. Now for CPI numbers, I said earlier this week it would be hard for me to imagine CPI having good news or good numbers. However, for the market to be good it need only be less than the 9.1 reading from the last CPI. Nobody ever seems to take into consideration the governments cheating by always moving the goal post. We will get a CPI number but it's not the real number because they are overlooking and taking certain things out of the latest calculations of CPI, go back and look at revisions and you will see how they keep raising numbers to be in line with Fed speak. Earlier this week I pointed out that momentum to the upside was fleeting. So, imagine a water hose spewing water and when you cut the water off it doesn't immediately stop spewing water it slows down. If you have the water hose pointed up it slows down and if you move the hose a bit it could still give you that last couple of good sprays before retreating back in the hose. This is where we are on the weekly and daily chart, down to the last one or two good sprays. 

Key levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)412-413, (queen)414-415 and (king)416-420 area. Support (jack)411-410(queen)409-408 and (King)407-403. The main thesis is Bearish bias closing below 411.35 projected target/low of between 411-406. Alt thesis is Bullish bias closing above 411.35 projected target/high 414-420. The numbers were showing bearish thesis however whenever more traders are on one side and we get the opposite reaction that opposite reaction will be super explosive, and that is the set up for today. The current major channel we are in 397-416 and the next major channel up is from 416-425.  Scenarios for the day: 

1) Trend day up we open gap up and start with a fade back toward the previous close. We find support on or before the previous close then begin the uptrend for the morning. We find midday chop around either possible queen or king resistance.  (Also notice that the gap is large enough to make it feel like a down trend has started but until we cross the previous close this is still an uptrend day type) or vice versa. **37% probability** 

2) Rounded reversal day type structure. We could get a continued push higher toward jack or queen resistance area and find midday chop around either queen or king resistance before spending the same energy we used going up to come back down the second half of the day or vice versa.  **33% probability** 

3)   Expanded Range Day structure We could look to set a decision area/ low boundary around the jack or queen support area before reversing back up.   Or vice versa **30% probability**",0

GPUs aren't the main story with AMD, CPUs are

the most successful semiconductor company over the last decade AMD reveals Zen 4. Zen is the codename for a family of computer processor microarchitectures from AMD, first launched in 2017 with the 1st gen of its Ryzen CPUs. It is used in Ryzen (desktop &amp; mobile), Ryzen Threadripper (workstation/high end desktop), &amp; Epyc (server)

RYZEN, a combination of 'horizon' &amp; their codename 'zen' &amp; EPYC, connoting a 'new epoch' or 'era' in server computing, &amp; change of 'epic' scale

AMD Ryzen microchips are used in Tesla cars replacing the Intel Atom chips

Tesla started installing an upgraded accelerated processing unit (APU) in the newly-built Tesla Model 3 &amp; Model Y cars — the AMD RDNA 2-based Ryzen APU. Before this upgrade, the Tesla Model 3 &amp; Model Y had the basic low-level Intel Atom graphics processing unit (GPU)

Tesla has shown that it is aware of the importance of computing power inside its vehicles going forward, &amp; much like the rest of the personal computing industry, it’s going to regularly update its computers with more performance. that’s both for driver-assist/self-driving systems &amp; for the media center &amp; that is a scientific fact

AMD is designed into data centers by some of the world’s largest hyperscalers. Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Tencent Cloud

MS analyst reinstated AMD overweight $103 price target, I think $180 is to be fair ... I see a more attractive valuation following the recent pullback in AMD which can rise 120%.

For those not in the know, the Ryzen (formerly Atom) is responsible for handling infotainment duties on Tesla EVs. It’s directly responsible for the screen's responsiveness when activating menus, playing games, loading apps like YouTube or Netflix, &amp; swiping around the navigational map &amp; the new AMD Ryzen chip absolutely smokes the old Intel Atom chip

Tesla originally used Nvidia SoC's in its older vehicles, but switched 3 years ago to Intel' Atom CPUs for the infotainment centers in Model 3 &amp; newer versions of the Model X &amp; Model S. Tesla now switched the Model S &amp; X to AMD chips, &amp; completing the transition with the Model Y. Tesla's new AMD graphics chipset has PS5 Performance

Tesla has shown that it is aware of the importance of computing power inside its vehicles going forward, and much like the rest of the personal computing industry, it’s going to regularly update its computers with more performance, that’s both for driver-assist/self-driving systems and for the media center

I am citing strength in AMD's partnership with Tesla &amp; its server business warrants a higher multiple due to a wide moat &amp; growth trajectory, the valuation is really compelling. NVDA has been the winner up to this point, now it's AMD's time to shine, as it's notably cheaper than NVDA based on multiple valuation metrics

# If this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.

Don’t get me wrong Zuckerberg is running that company in the ground with Meta. However, eventually he’s going to take such a big financial hit he’s open to dropping Meta. “But he’s already lost hundreds of billions” you are probably saying. Here’s the thing though, he still has FUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKKK YOOOOOOUUUUUU MONEY. That’s put your dick on the table, and stare everyone straight in the eyes while you do it money. The money he’s left with at this point is still so high it’s imaginary. The one way that number becomes real is if keeps on with Meta. I don’t know at what point in Zuck’s psychology he cracks, but he will eventually when the money he has left becomes “real”. At that point he’ll drop META and get back to Facebook. As beaten up as this stock is, and even with the overall market down this much, FB would be up insane percentages in a quarter or two following this news. Do I think we have more push to the downside before we get there? Yes, of course but ultimately if I’m right in my thinking, that could be the drop that makes Zuckerberg pivot his stance, even if he still believes in Meta the reality of the economy and situation would force his hand. However, at some point after the big dump off we’re headed for, META is probably a good play in a 1-3 year span. If it goes on longer than that you risk no one caring about FB by that point and have moved on to another platform.",0

Important Zones to Watch

\~432 resistance

\~409 support

\~383 support 

%K crossing %D on stochastics this is an indicator of a new bearish trend

&amp;#x200B;

[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/dap7xdv0sym81.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29b5558d1d4a1f8a13e97ce9856e550618b8f500)

When a trend this obvious forms every algorithm will start to pick up.  Remember about 70% of the trades are done by algorithms; they move the markets.  I do not think a downtrend this strong will continue forever but in the short term... this is now a strong indicator.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Graphing Calculator](https://preview.redd.it/zbek7vc6sym81.png?width=1703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9d262038a846f2b2a31c9a32c5bc66acb6d2995)

This week I just changed the formulas so they automatically calculate the least squares line of regression and plot the offsetted lines from standard deviations.  There is lots of room to move downward on Monday opening since Friday closed at roughly the mean.

&amp;#x200B;

[Normal Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/yrify1vpsym81.png?width=1849&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bee35df9529badbad716c2b7e2e8b9bb078a3a5)

These formulas will calculate and shade a normal distribution curve for the statistically predicted price of SPY from the days past December 31st.  Normal distribution really does occur everywhere.  On the left side d = 73 which is the day of 3/14.  This is the statistically predicted price for SPY for Monday market close.

&amp;#x200B;

[Calculation for area of an inequality under normal distribution curve](https://preview.redd.it/w6qprtj7tym81.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=465f38af3fd8c4400990b9feb5fac64a2eb71e5e)

From this model there is a 79.7% that SPY will close below 428 on Monday; good news to put holders and volatility ETF holders!

&amp;#x200B;

[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/empxx8bnuym81.png?width=1497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4edfae8679fab8b18cbe045b8ca17564dca41c3)

This is an extremely important indicator.  When the 50 day moving average crosses the 200 day moving average this is known as a death cross.  While the death cross is not 100% accurate it has predicted the worst bear markets: 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008.  There are funds that will not buy any stocks that have the 50 day moving average below the 200 day moving average because they will statistically underperform the overall market.  This is definitely something to pay attention to, it will be a major event signaling a bear market. 

&amp;#x200B;

[US Bonds Friday Close](https://preview.redd.it/0xjlc4txvym81.png?width=319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1bee5ab9a72f41582685d8650e1e12f8e2e5049)

Not much to say about bonds, short terms are soaring and long terms are flat.  The yield curve is flattening... yes it is happening.  An inverted yield curve has predicted EVERY recession.  This is as close to a perfect indicator that you can get.  If this happens, the week the yield curve inverts will be insane, every fund will be panic selling.  Keep a close eye on bonds in the upcoming weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

[Federal Reserve Calendar](https://preview.redd.it/dgqqyx5jtym81.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9edb3ee2f4ccf88242a4868801f0d35591798167)

Lots of investors will be watching when the Fed has a meeting Tuesday and Wednesday followed by an announcement.  The big question is: 25bp or 50bp rate hike?

[Purchasing Power](https://preview.redd.it/nvrrlt18bzm81.png?width=1048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=769c20c0dc442617b9717fc3e09e25788af1c345)

The purchasing power of the dollar is now worse than the peak of the financial crisis in 2008.  This shows how much of a hole the Fed has dug us into with all of this quantitative easing.

&amp;#x200B;

[Inflation Metrics](https://preview.redd.it/3yyaec81ezm81.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75734f7972d13188b2a854db72301b9f3c4ccb57)

It is honestly crazy how the federal reserve can report that CPI is only 7.9%, if it was calculated the same way it was in the 80s then it would be reported as 16% now.  Many people are being misled by the federal reserve's reports.

https://preview.redd.it/dj3ldtjsozm81.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caf6be31bcab815af153808737b8342894ed3890

**Predictions**

We are in for another rough week in the markets.  Even though there was 4 red days last week in the markets, nothing will be getting better.  The demand for commodities is increasing and the supply is only decreasing: last week Russia officially banned the export of wheat.  Although there was a correction there is is still an overall uptrend in most commodities.  

The stochastics are currently about 30 on SPY, not completely in the oversold range so there can still be strong selling pressure.  I think the support zone at 409 will be easily broken and then some buyers will start to step back in.

Two more major indicators are the death cross and yield curve.  When the death cross happens I am sure investors will panic but remember it is not a 100% guaranteed indicator.  The yield curve is a 100% indicator though.  3 year versus 10 year is flat.  If the 3 month yield exceeds the 10 year yield then that is almost a 100% indicator that there will be a recession in the next one to two years.

The important event happening this week is the FOMC meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.  There will be an announcement at 2pm EST Wednesday make sure to watch for this.  As seen in the chart above 97% of investors are confident there will be a 25bp rate hike.  A couple of weeks ago I was confident the Fed would mention a 50bp hike in their testimony in front of Congress, it was mentioned but not talked about as much as I thought.  While many people think they need to do a 50bp rate hike they only think the Fed will do a 25bp rate hike since anything major could cause the markets to crash.  I want there to be a 50bp rate hike but the chance of this actually happening is minimal.  A 25bp rate hike is almost guaranteed here so no crazy volatility unless they decide to do a 50bp rate hike... If they do a 50bp rate hike then yeah: everything will crash.

Many investors will watch bad news and do more in depth research so I am expecting Monday to be bearish, I bought UVXY Thursday and Friday and am holding over the weekend.  Tuesday the selling pressure will settle and buyers will probably take control.  Wednesday though, the rate hike decision will be watched very closely, I am not expecting the market to be green if they announce a 25bp hike.  There is really nothing bullish about that, the short term economy is just being propped up at the expense of the long term economy, more people are starting to realize that now.  Thursday and Friday the selling pressure will continue unless some peace treaty is made by Russia, this is unlikely though, Putin does not want to give up.  This Friday is the third Friday of the month and it will be a \*quad witching event\* basically lots of futures and options contracts expire and the market will pullback in anticipation for this; it will be a very volatile day.  

 \* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more

"If you had a bad week take my debit spread on aapl your guaranteed to profitOkay so I'm not sure how your week went guy but here is a really safe play both the prices strike prices are itm underneath support 

So the play it's a weekly personally I don't really like playing these but this one is looking very promising I used the bid and ask price for both of these so you should get instantly filled probably can squeeze out a little more profit if your willing to wait to get filled.

So the play

Buy a aapl 9/21 call strike price is 215$ you should be expecting to pay around 9.35$ to get instantly filled 

Sell a aapl 9/21 call strike price is 217.50 ( support is 218$) to instantly sell it'll have to be at 7.00

Now you maximum net debit of 235$ this is the most you can lose 

If aapl is above 217.51 you'll make a whole 15$ 
If aapl is below 217.50 youll lose all your debit 235$ 

Now here is the beautiful part is aapl is above 220.50$ you make your maximum return of 265$ 

Because your 215$ will be worth 5.50$ at 200.50 
And the one you sold short (217.50)  will be a -50$ to you 550-50= 500 now take that 500$ and take away your debit of $235 and your return is 265 enjoy :)

"I watched NFLX with The Ghost of Charles Ponzi and he showed me my yachtAn associate of mine recently returned from a weekend camping trip to West Virginia, I do not consider anyone that goes to West Virginia a friend because I can't trust them. Anyone that goes to West Virginia is not up to any good and I don't want to be involved.

Anyway he came back and brought with him mushrooms he picked from a cattle ranch. I'm quite fond of such delicacies so I indulged myself. I was home alone for a about an hour when everything got a bit strange. By the time I realized there was something odd about those mushrooms, The Ghost of Charles Ponzi appeared. 

He sat down on my couch and quickly said ""I have something to show you, sit down"".

I sit down, he tells Google to turn on the TV. He had to use the remote to turn on Netflix because Netflix doesn't communicate well with others. 

He turns on a show and it's me on a small yacht reading a book on the deck.

He then handed me a paper and disappeared.

"4-6-22 SPY/ Apple Daily TAThe coveted FOMC minutes release finally happened. What did we learn? Well not a whole lot new honestly. All we have learned is that clearly JPOW are hawkish and ready to do another 0.5bps hike in May at the next meeting. We also learned that the previously doveish members are now even hawkish. 

SPY had a massive gap down at open today from 451 close all the way to 447.3 at open, which of course left a big gap on the daily chart. We know how SPY does not like to leave gaps too… 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fpfvqc4k10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83bc89d145cfecdce94507165673aece3ae9233c

Intraday despite the massively red pre-market and first big red candle SPY traded within a pretty tight range hovering around 445.5 from 945am to 130pm. We saw some green start to take off right before the minutes dropped. They got a lot of people with the fake out (me included) with running it all the way to 448.5 before they dropped it like its hot to 444.2 immediately after. From there I saw some of the craziest intraday swings in such a short period of time that I have ever seen. 

Spy dropped from 448.5 to a low of 443.47 (-1.1%, $5) rose to a high of 448.93 (+1.23%, $5.5) and then dipped to 445.32 (-0.8%, $3.5) and rose to 448 (+0.6%, $2.7) all within two hours of trading. That kind of volatility has not been seen in quite a long time. And being end of the day those who were brave enough to play 0dte made some incredible gains. I was able to recoup my losses plus 2x daily profit on one 0dte put on the initial -1.1% drop along with a few call plays to hit 6x daily profit in one day. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/20qyh0vk10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c09e88166331fcec08f5b2056873f3ebf36339c

It is not surprising that we traded so close to 445.5 all day as that level is a key support of the Daily 20ema. It looked like when the minutes released we may see an aggressively red day and close below those key supports near the 440 level, however, 445 proved to be too strong to break through today. We also found out that 448 to 449 was major resistance too, as anytime we touched it end of day we immediately rejected down.

With a clear MACD sell and RSI trending downward now, favor to bears short term.

On the daily chart you can see we technically still have about an 89 cent gap from 448.93 to 449.82. Some could argue a gap this small is not important and will not be filled yet. One also may argue since its to the upside the push to close it now is not there as much as a gap below would be. Todays close and post market still have some bearish flavor to it. However, being able to close about the EMAs is fairly bullish. 

Intraday tomorrow and overnight we need to see if 1. The gap will be filled up to 449.82 and 2. If the daily 20ema (447.05), daily 100ema (446.7) and daily 50ema (445.2) is going to hold as support intraday tomorrow with the daily 50ema being the key support. If we were to get a bullish push tomorrow the daily 8ema at 451.37 will now come in to play as possible resistance. Failure for bulls to break and close above that again would be bearish. 

If the bears were to get another true bear day I would suspect they will try to close near the 200ema at 439.82. That being the final support bulls have to hold before we would see 410-420 again. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l3h71cpl10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c48bf03234f779648e9cdd5b12a2b0a89ce94e9b

The weekly candle is now coming in fairly bearish after a doji last week would hint to me that we very well could see some red next week also. Key support for bulls to hold would be the weekly 8ema at 444.88 and the weekly 20ema at 446.43. A close back below those would all be confirm a dip next week back near the weekly 50ema of 435.07. 

&amp;#x200B;

The VIX had yet another massive day today from its low of 21.24 to its highest point of 24.78 ranging 16.6% of movement. This is three massive movement days for VIX in a row, yet we have not really seen a massive 2%+/- day for SPY yet. I believe tomorrow or Friday it is coming. 

https://preview.redd.it/859rj1dm10s81.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e1e339da7ce05cd1b42af887d81a063f4c23fa

The VIX key level to watch is 24.5 for the bears and 22 for the bulls. Now that the VIX is back ABOVE the average of 16.5 to 21.5 the bulls are in favor here as its is usually easier for VIX to unwind down with no new news than to go up. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fs87cr4n10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f73551d16c61e551142a0c8accadd5bff0a408b

Apple is looking similar to SPY on the daily chart with a clear MACD sell, and rsi at 53 trending down. Apple also has a pretty significant gap from 174.42 to 173.63 (0.45%, 0.79) on the daily chart. 

Apple found support today at its daily 20ema which has not ben touched in over two weeks. 

Apple bulls need a green day tomorrow to fill the gap up to a 174.42, however, they will need to break now resistance at the daily 8ema. 

Apple bears will look for a close below the daily 20ema at 170.96. Bears will not need a very red day to accomplish this and their ultimate goal will be to get Apple below the daily 50ema at 168.44(only -2% from todays close) by end of the week. If bears can accomplish this 157 to 165 will be back in play. A close below the daily 100ema of 165.31 (-3.8% from close) while a very tough chore to accomplish in two days, it is not out of possibility for Apple depending how markets react. 

The questions going into tomorrow is now that the markets have the full minutes from FOMC and nothing news wise until April 12th with the next CPI data…. Which I fully expect to be awful and another emergency/ surprise rate hike. With the markets now seeing the true hawkish fed and the new info about the balance sheets/ QT and rate hikes is the markets going to go back into full panic mode like January? Or will the markets too quickly price this in and return to full rally mode? 

I will be looking at tomorrows close and more importantly Fridays close for that clue. We have key supports and resistance that will give us a clue going into next week. 

I will be back on the sever all day tomorrow after taking the morning off for personal errands and I will also have a proper pre market post up around 9am tomorrow on the server for everyone. 

10% challenge-

Today was a pretty good day for me.

As I said I was gone all morning and ended up not trading till about 1230. I entered some Apple and Spy puts around that time that I held till the first big green candle at 2pm and sold both for -50%. I then was able to grab a nice 80% 0dte play on the way down to recoup those loses + x2 my daily gains goalI had another 2dte -20% put that I played on the first recovery bounce when it faked us out red before ripping green (which is when I entered calls). I then played two different 2dte calls one for 40% and one for 30%. Overall being able to hit 6x my daily profit goal is incredible. I look to go into Thursday and Friday with low risk and being very conservative as I do not want to risk losing all these gains on silly plays. Friday if I have a good day tomorrow will look for a slightly higher risk on than usual though.",0

"$SPY dd part 3: staying long through next week**SUMMARY OF RECENT PAST DD**

* SPY DD Part 1. Five days ago I posted [my first part on long SPX](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/urj7jh/spy_5_reasons_why_i_am_going_long_short_term_trade/), 
* SPY DD Part 2. Two days ago I added a [complement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usyczy/us_citi_economic_surprises_turns_negative_macro/) on Citi Economic Surprises

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY DD PART 3. THREE ADDITIONAL PIECES OF EVIDENCE**

**First**. the spread between the [50 and 200 day moving averages](https://toggle.ai/chart/spx/spx.price_mavg_spread(horiz=50d,horiz2=200d)) is reaching ""value"" levels, if one can talk about value in pure price terms (i.e. without reference to a value anchor like earnings)

[Spread between 50D and 200D moving average for SPX](https://preview.redd.it/8s35yls092191.png?width=1502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a9d99b8c2d8e06d67e912931d84e2a8a9d06ae1)

**Second**. One [bottom-up leading indicators](https://toggle.ai/my-toggle) I follow is now screaming into long territory

[This is a bottom up leading indicator based on fundamentals of US companies](https://preview.redd.it/xh9pndcc92191.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10f7622d2364b3d449c2613d9f5122cb37f0800b)

**Third**. [VIX](https://toggle.ai/chart/vix/vix.price.ds) is not going up. So either SPY has to rally or VIX needs to rise

&amp;#x200B;

[VIX can't seem to breach 35](https://preview.redd.it/cgzvroc3a2191.png?width=1494&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d75590a991e6ccb7b6e6bb2d32518d69d6f4367)

&amp;#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

I think VIX is telling the truth, the market is consolidating and finding a bottom for the next week or so.",1

1. Broker?

- Tastyworks. Free permissions to do naked options as long as you have initial margin requirements.

2. Margin requirements to sell naked options?

- I think it depends on broker, underlying stock, strike, date, IV, and other stuff. July 19 $195/275 short strangle for $10.53 credit is showing $2.2k buying power reduction for me. Meanwhile a short straddle at $230 for $36.38 credit is showing $4.6k BPR. 

3. Your current/next moves?

- Currently selling some uncovered AMZN options. https://i.imgur.com/PztIVlz.png. Not the best margin reduction to profit ratio, but it's a fun play. Will start selling TSLA in the future when next earnings comes up. For the time being, I consider selling puts under $220 as ""safe"" and calls over $255 as ""safe."" Anything can change.

"One day till CPI. Get ready. 8/9/22 Premarket outlook and Technical Analysis for day trading the SPY. 

Goodmorning traders, one day until CPI. Let’s examine what has happen technically coming into CPI. The First thing that I see is that the daily chart’s MACD has flatten out. One of my rules for swing trades is never short on a vertical MACD. Now that it has leveled out now, we may be able to start hunting for shorts. The weekly chart is still the chart in control and it is in its water break or rest area but it still seems to have a little more sideways action baked into it. Remember, when a chart hits its rest area like a runner in a marathon there is a tendency to run in place (consolidate)while it builds energy to go thru the next level or range. This Consolidation on the weekly chart could be a very large range (possible 421 down to 405). The weekly chart also feels like it is at or nearing the top of its current range. With this down move starting to play out before CPI, remember the market is a pricing model that likes to price in event ahead of time. So, we could be setting up for a sell the rumor and buy the fact which goes along with the bizarro world effect we have been in because I can’t imagine CPI being good news. Now if the weekly is the chart in control remember waiting on the turn in the weekly is like waiting on a tanker ship to make a U-turn. Knowing this we have to watch the daily and 4-hour for early signs and entries. This is all setting up for a very nice pop back up during or after the CPI report where we can start looking for swing short.

Key levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)413-414, (queen)415-416and (king)417-420 area. Support (jack)411-410(queen)409-408 and (King)407-403. The main thesis is Bearish bias closing below 412.99 projected target/low of between 411-406. Alt thesis is Bullish bias closing above 412.99 projected target/high 413-419.The current major channel we are in 397-416 and the next major channel up is from 416-425.  Scenarios for the day:

1)  Expanded Range Day structure We could look to set a decision area/ high boundary around the jack or queen resistance area then chopping back down.   Or vice versa **34% probability**

2) Trend day down we open gap down and start with a pop back toward the previous close. We find resistance on or before the previous close then begin the downtrend for the morning. We find midday chop around either possible queen or king support. or vice versa. **33% probability**

3) Rounded reversal day type structure. We could get a continued push lower toward jack or queen support area and find midday chop around either queen or king support before spending the same energy we used going down to come back up the second half of the day or vice versa.  **33% probability**",1

Oil just spiked, we are at a double top in the market, economic data has been better lately (less need for a cut), equity inflows are up, and Trump tweeted that he made a mistake picking jpow 💥 for Fed chair a few days ago, leading me to believe he was alerted early on a cut wasn’t coming. Plus, everyone on WSB is posting that a giant dip is coming because a cut will either not arrive, or will be perceived as “not enough”...

"Preface: Amazon recently had a 20:1 stock split this past Friday (taking affect on Monday). Google has its upcoming 20:1 split slated for mid-July.&amp;#x200B;

Do you see any potential in the recent Amazon split and upcoming Google 20:1? Are these Blue Chips, stocks that our dads wished they invested in before the price was to high for the average investor, going to be more attractive now that they are ""affordable"". I know that splits are have no intrinsic value, it doesn't mean that they are actually ""cheaper"" but it does have a phycological affect on average traders who don't have millions to invest. I'm more inclined to purchase Amazon and Google at $100+ and own ""more"" whole shares, than spend limited capital on a few or have fractional share (I'm with TD, so I don't have the ability to purchase fractional shares yet.)

&amp;#x200B;

Right now my strategy was to purchase Amazon option calls before the split, that expire next Friday (Jun 10), with expectations that the price will go up next week. I also purchased Google calls well in advance anticipating the price will go up in the weeks prior to the split. These calls expire the day of the split and some in August.  What are some of you all doing, if anything?

The ideal next week:
- Google fucks up on earnings
- Google tanks the entire market
- Use my profits from shorting google to reinvest in cheap Facebook/Amazon
- Facebook/Amazon/Twitter hit it out of the park and I am mega rich

The most probable outcome:

- Google does well in earnings
- My puts go to zero, but the entire market is lifted.
- I have so much more in calls than puts that I end up the day positive
- Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter report good earnings and I still end up rich at end of week

The also likely scenario:

- Google does well in earnings
- My puts go to zero, but the entire market is lifted.
- I have so much more in calls than puts that I end up the day positive
- Facebook and Amazon report great earnings, but Twitter fucks up because of the bot thing
- End up in the green because FB/AMZN calls outweigh twitter and google fuckups

"NVDA GPU prices are skyrocketing ...TLDR: NVDA will likely beat the low-ball $5.9B and raise guidance for next quarter easily... 

4090 GPUs are selling in hot demand after absolutely shattering the gaming records set by the 3090 last year at the same price point. The selling prices right now are &gt;$2200, above the $1600 MSRP and are currently unavailable for purchase anywhere for less than $2200. Furthermore from source [1], the 4090 was retailing at around $2000 US in the Asian markets but since launch, the price has started to hike up and currently sits at around $3000 US. At the same time, the demand for NVIDIA's H100 GPUs has shot up due to the upcoming China ban. The H100 PCIe accelerator which was available for $11,000 US is now selling for over $33,000$. The SXM version of the same GPU sells for even more but is much harder to come by. 

Although NVIDIA has suspended sales of their high-end AI GPUs in China, they have up till September 2023 to fulfill all current orders. Nvidia says that they are applying for export licenses for non-military use in China. The NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs can also be supplied through Hong Kong before 1st September 2023 so it looks like there's at least 1 year of time given to customers to finalize their orders with NVIDIA. Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales (~10% of total datacenter sales from China) of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It said it plans to apply for exemptions to the rule.

&gt;If GPU prices go up however, this potential lost booking might not be as bad as people think. It could actually prove to be a tailwind.

&gt;People also don't realize that the 4090 absolutely destroys AI workloads (just not to the same scale as H100 due to the lack of NVlink) from [3]. I suspect a chunk of AI chip demand will come from mid-scale enterprise (not hyperscalers) scooping up 4090s going forward after the Sept 2023 ban. 

NVIDIA Clean Sweeps MLPerf AI Benchmarks With Hopper H100 GPU, Up To 4.5x Performance Uplift Over Ampere A100. Biren [2] chips were a strong competitor of Ampere but now they are banned from using any advanced node unless they get export licenses. Where will China get their AI chips after Sept 2023? This will make GPU prices incredibly elevated for at least the next year. 

There are geopolitical risks but these risks are in some ways good for Nvidia in the long term. The upcoming recession is causing trouble for AI chip companies as this industry is very winner-takes-all (ask AMD). The china ban got rid of Nvidia's main competition from Biren and Huawei. I was bearish on Nvidia short term due to China, but after the recent hot 4090 and H100 demand and the 4090 benchmarks, I am bullish on NVDA.

"11-21-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisThat was probably one of the worst days to trade that I have seen in months. The volatility and unpredictability of trading today was unmatched. I had extreme flash backs to June and July where SPY was so irrational it was untradeable. The pretty extreme low volume (we are 4 mil currently at this moment below the lowest volume day of the year) made for even harder trading today. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/im8lk7kgpd1a1.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27eb2cdf258092943a5701d05f273649aec1cdf1

This is where things continue to perplex me and I continue to struggle with what the fed is trying to do or say. Look at this years CPI YoY forecasts and actual readings. Since July 13th we have not had a single increase in CPI YoY. We have also not had a single CPI YoY forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting. Now we look at CORE CPI YoY and from August until October core was rising, however, last reading core decreased again. 

So we have the fed and mind you they’ve been saying “inflation is not under control” since at least July maybe August. But we are seeing inflation slowing… not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal… but with CPI YoY decreasing and CORE ranging from 5.9 to 6.6% with most of it being 5.9 to 6.3% I feel like there I just something the fed isn’t telling us. Or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound? I mean think about JPOW last FOMC what did he tell us? We was VERY clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature. Which means that almost all the fed members and even JPOW himself knows inflation isn’t under control. 

This next CPI and FOMC meeting will be very interesting to say the least. The case for a huge CPI miss is growing by the minute for me. However, we don’t have any consensus yet (investing.com says forecast but that really the consensus…. There is a TEforecast out but I find that inaccurate). There is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until CPI and FOMC. Which then perhaps CPI misses and FOMC remains bearish and we see this drop hard. 

Wednesday is FOMC minute day and we should get some more information from JPOW and what the fed members are thinking there. (I will release the FOMC minute trade play to the pre-market section tonight). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lfrxzj5hpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=191381b89207ff63d8075f2910dae56ddf47af39

Last week I brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in. However, we are still showing bullish enough moves here. To not short this. 

The bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today (that was interesting) we are still holding that daily 8ema. That support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 394.7 to 398.5. Now mind you I really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 398.5 and actually touch that resistance… but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range. 

We closed yet again another doji on spy too. I am eyeing a possible carrot top (blue lines) formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema. While we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it. 

The issue we have here is this… buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25% of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls. While we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before CPI/ FOMC I feel like no one wants to go long here on calls. However, sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early. 

Bears aren’t ready to hard sell and bulls don’t want to keep buying. So we are left with this terrible chop. 

Key support- 394.7 -&gt; 390.1

Futures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart. Futures continues to hold 3960 support and remains under 4000 resistance. Looking at futures I actually see a clearer trend than I do on SPY. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b4woaa4ipd1a1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56818a1864ada48fd356d989717ecd5cbe37bdb6

I removed some of my trend lines here to make this look more clear. There is a nice diamond pattern forming here on Futures. This pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down. This pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005. 

&amp;#x200B;

Out of curiosity I went back to SPY and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one. Support at 394 and resistance at 397.8 for tomorrow. 

Back to futures now.

Zooming out here first to show you the Tesla Daily and show you what lines goes where before we zoom in and chat about them. Focus on the bold dark green line here. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy86mnojpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5225f763631b55f413c3dd6bc3e2cb95122ac2fe

Now looking at the zoomed in daily you can see that Tesla actually did break through the daily support line for the green bear channel. This green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel. We are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in December. 

Interestingly enough about Tesla here is we have a red falling wedge, a red/ black falling wedge and a blue/ red falling wedge. Now People have been calling for a bounce since 204.8 and since the 234 rejection back on November 1st. 

This is where I struggle as it just seems Tesla cant quite catch a break. Had a bad news day on Friday and then again today (recalls I guess). The question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go? Or is this the easiest short of 2022? 

I want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… 

Sept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   
 Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  
 Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  
 Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  
 Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   
 Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  
 

Average # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  
 Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  
 Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  
 Average % for the pop= 11.81%  
 

so what does this tell us? 

Well being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. 

This also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. 

Looking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… 

Lets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. 

That means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. 

To be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks.

Really tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. 

From there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. 

A red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. 

HOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… 

Anyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. 

People really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. 

Long story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them…. Do not be greedy!

$SPY Rising Wedge About to Breakdown,1
"i SPY more dipwhere are we and where are we going?

yesterday we finished the day with a green doji candle. we could have went either way really today. historically speaking a doji after a dip usually resulted in a big green day. that absolutely didnt happen today. today we traded between the 20 day EMA and 50 EMA. Early morning we saw the test and rejection of the 20 ema. we shortly after saw the test and rejection of breaking the 50 ema which left us in limbo. 
we tried during power hour to gain any momentum to run up and was not able to get any green momentum. we found ourselves selling off heavily right at the end there dropping as low as 466 before we closed. We also have a confirmed daily and weekly sell on the MACD along with a bearish engulfing weekly candle. 

next week i expect a similar fate for us. i expect us to retest the support at the 50 ema which i suspect we will break easily at 464.5. from there we should continue this stair step down towards the final goal/ support at the 100 ema near 455. i suspect it to be closer to 456-457 by time we get there. i do find it rather healthy the way this sell off is happening. instead of wild -2%+ days we are slowly stair stepping down. i like it. 

one thing im watching here is that in general gaps are filled. however if this stair stepping is continued the gap will be below both the 100 ema and the support line. we could see a fast wic down to fill it and a hard bounce. but if that red dotted support line thats over 1.5 years old is broken. we very well could see an even more significant 10%+ from ATH dip. im not convinced thats the market sentiment though yet and will evaluate once there. 

im playing my puts till we break below 460 then i will be looking to sell them and find some longer dated calls. i of course still play the intraday options but for my long term thats my play. 

of course added a picture of my positons to show im not full of it.

Oil just spiked, we are at a double top in the market, economic data has been better lately (less need for a cut), equity inflows are up, and Trump tweeted that he made a mistake picking jpow 💥 for Fed chair a few days ago, leading me to believe he was alerted early on a cut wasn’t coming. Plus, everyone on WSB is posting that a giant dip is coming because a cut will either not arrive, or will be perceived as “not enough”...

"Long $AMD, Massive Intel In-Hardware Security Bug Found (Hotfix Requires -30% Perf Penalty)You faggots doubted SuBae, but her journey to the moon is undaunted by your cum-guzzling ways. 

Confirmed homosexual firm, $INTC, will be announcing [a massive in-hardware security bug in its modern processors that will require a **-30% performance penalty** to hotfix it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/intel_bug_incoming/). This will notably affect large datacenter customers such as $GOOG and $AMZN (short them for maximum tendies). 

* As an in-hardware bug, this is not easy to fix and will require a brutal hotfix as a temporary measure. A less destructive fix will not be available until the hardware is replaced with updated models in the coming years (as if customers would choose to buy more $INTC products after this!). 

* The bug is currently under embargo much like $INTC is still officially in the closet. In the coming days, $INTC will publicly acknowledge its sexual orientation and the existence of this bug. 

* [$INTC's CEO sold off $11M of $INTC stock less than two weeks ago](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/19/intels-ceo-just-sold-a-lot-of-stock.aspx) and now holds the bare minimum number of shares required by the CEO according to $INTC by-laws. Looks like he's getting his yacht while he still can! 

* Competing processors made by SuBae are confirmed to not be affected by this vulnerability as their architecture is much girthier. 

This leaves **SuBae poised to fuck the competition up the ass** on large datacenter contracts. 

* $AMD has recently [ramped up production on their 32-core ""EPYC"" CPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12032/amd-announces-wider-epyc-availability-and-rocm-17-with-tensorflow-support) that competes in the datacenter market. 

* Not only does the 32C EPYC have more cores than $INTC's flaccid 28C CPU, but [EPYC costs half as much](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11544/intel-skylake-ep-vs-amd-epyc-7000-cpu-battle-of-the-decade/10). 

* SuBae is rumored to release an [EPYC 2.0 with an even more turgid 64-core CPU as early as 2019](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-2-64-cores-128-threads-and-256mb-l3-cache). 

 * Impotent traitor, [Raja Kodorki, is confirmed to not be involved with Epyc in any way](http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-boss-raja-koduri-joins-intel-to-work-on-integrated-and-discrete-graphics/) and will only be adding performance issues to $INTC products going forward. 

* SuBae won't rest until EPYC is packed deep into datacenters everywhere, leaving $INTC frustrated and on the streets to beg for tendies. 

I see **$AMD trading at $15 by weeks end**. It's yacht time, faggots. ",1

"I just bet against SPY and the DOW based on some DD. Am I stupid?So I took positions against SPY today (and against the DOW, A/K/A ""Boomer SPY"") because I noticed what I thought to be a divergence between the movement of the market and the underlying indicators.

From April 23 to June 17th/18th we can see the following:

The price of SPY has increased slightly.

The MACD has formed two bear crosses. Importantly: the second cross is at a lower point than the first cross, and thus it diverges with the underlying direction of the stock price (which is positive).

The RSI is also at a lower point on June 17th than it was on Aril 23, despite the underlying price going up.

Below is everything I've described thus far summed up in a doodle:

https://preview.redd.it/vabpwvs9s3671.jpg?width=1108&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bbdc21acb8bf33d5b1245b33d68e7d63cc73040

Generally, when you see the indicators moving in a bearish direction while the stock is moving in a bullish direction it can be an indication that the stock price may reverse. This is also known as a divergence.

Another bearish indicator can be when a candle closes below a moving average. Swing traders tend to look at the 9 day and 50 day moving averages for confirmation of whether to enter or exit positions. Here, we can we can see a full candle close below the 9-day MA on 6/17 and a full close below the 50-day on 6/18. I think this is pretty significant because these candle closes formed right after the lower RSI/MACD figures.

For full disclosure I have positions in SPXS (which is a 3X inverse SPY ETF) and SDOW (which is a 3X inverse DOW ETF). I think we may see a continued reversal into next week based on this information and I'm posting this because I'm curious if other people are taking similar positions, or at least selling positions in anticipation of a reversal?

Also this is not financial advice. Nothing on this sub is financial advice.

"6-30-22 SPY Daily TaLet me tell you a story about a stock market that’s having the worst first half of a year since 1962… The headline should read “the most manipulated market ever.”

https://preview.redd.it/lkoxqqvvvt891.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7baf4054e7290a326ce1c5e79c514d8c450f4af

This morning around I believe it was 11am I was looking at my charts and noticed while we sat near 374 and had only seen a HOD of 377 that the daily range was already saying we had touched 380.53. I thought that was odd. I checked the daily candle and sure enough… it looked like we touched 380.53. I thought well that’s odd so I checked TOS and webull and they said the same thing! We had only see $4.44 of movement but they were telling us we had seen nearly $8 of movement… And my initial thoughts were a glitch or I miss a 1minute candle blip. Nope all clean and PM never even broke 380. 

So of course I first thoughts are we are going to see then run it to 380.53 range before they dump it… and what did they do? They ran it to 380.66 and IMMEDIATELY reversed it. I don’t know what kind of market fuckery that is right there but I have NEVER EVER seen anything like that before. 

https://preview.redd.it/m3b8zyfxvt891.png?width=289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f0130b45f3d56dca49c56e953be9d2436a6c869

https://preview.redd.it/tg8da76yvt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1674ee23e2705241cd17dd27d401fd1bc45e416

Are we having fun yet? Are we enjoying 2022 day/ swing trading? 

The coolest thing about today was watching JPM close out near $1.3 billion in profit on their collar today and open their near September collar. 

https://preview.redd.it/1gv0b6qyvt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63056f7395bad69eeb6a7655bd4dcd076c3d81b4

JPM is saying we wont break about 400 SPY (doubtful we fill the gap now at 410.5) and we should see about a 5% drop to 360 SPY and we are positioned for about 300 SPY worst case scenario. 

So with this information lets take a look at the daily and clean it up a little. 

https://preview.redd.it/x3xec2hzvt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e63aae5f959c1c0b7da3f12c48a2735b1b934c

We are holding the black channel support so far. I suspect us to break through that black dotted support line of 373 tomorrow. 

We now have a red dotted bear channel forming.

https://preview.redd.it/lpy24o30wt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c3dbc549c97d2344064c4c9740351b28d4f0e84

If you note on the daily using the black solid line and the red dotted support line we are actually seeing a huge falling wedge which means we just might see that 300 price target by end of July if things don’t improve. But we are on a clear path to 358 SPY right now. 

https://preview.redd.it/cf4p55r0wt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5453ff594b8e0b9e6163ded15551a6ee3f7c416

The weekly chart is what interests me the most… we are actually seeing a huge falling wedge forming there with the floor near that 350-358 price range for next week. I have a feeling now that we 1. Rejected breaking through weekly 8ema and 2. Broke down out of blue bull channel we are going to start our next sell off. 

We have been seeing for about the last 6 months now that the last week or first week of a month we get a change of trend… we are now due for a sell off. 

As much as I would love to say this is the time to go long 60-90dte puts I just don’t think it is…

What I think we are going to see is that SPY is going to trade between 360-380 until end of July. End of July bring a shit storm of things for us. 

We have Junes FOMC minutes releasing July 6th,  CPI on July 13th, FOMC on July 27th, GDP on July 29th (which most likely will be negative and confirm a recession), and then we also start earnings around the 2nd to 3rd week of July. 

I have a feeling earnings are gonna be dog water and with this last two weeks of July shit storm brewing we MIGHT have one more bull week or at least sideways week left in us before we finally see capitulation and get the next move down with a  price target of 300 SPY by September. 

10% challenge-

After having a killer week in theory that I turned into a shit week by failing to take profits all week out of pure greed I refused to do that today. Had a great day for sure. 

https://preview.redd.it/3v8at4f2wt891.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b3b215780207a2910d530a4714c18fc354fc8a0

My ONLY saltiness about today is I KNEW we were going to sell off EOD when we kept rejecting off of 380 but I was too scared to enter after yesterdays fuckery. I finally entered and had a position up about 40%... I decided to lock in a 25% stop limit sell order on the 0dte JUST IN CASE she turned against me. But I had VERY VERY strong intuition she was gonna see 100%+ profits… Well she triggered at 32% as you can see above in my log. I then only had $26 in BP left so I bought a 0dte 373 to let ride and of course as you can see within 4 minutes it was up well over 100%... It hit 150% at its peak. Had I just held on and believed I would have had 100%+ profits. 

But that’s how this market goes. The days we don’t secure profits like I did today or at least protect us from the downside is the days we get absolutely rocked like I did yesterday. And the days we do take profits are the days it perfectly hits our PT. The 11.4% and 10.7% I played earlier were the same thing a 10% stop limit just in case that triggered and both those went to see 100-200% gains also. This market is such a mind fuck on being able to trust the chart and indicators but also protecting yourself from tom-foolery.

"Google is running a scam. Their GOOG stock is a Pyramid scheme.GOOG is a C class stock without voting rights and it doesn’t pay dividends, and they said that they will not pay them in the future. The company explicitly said in its 2017 annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that ""we intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future."" Google states the ""par value” (the amount Google owes you for the stock) of each GOOG stock is 0.001$ US Dollars. Yet each stock is sold at 1700$ in the stock market.

Why does one buy a GOOG stock? To make money. But since GOOG doesn’t pay dividends, the only way to make money is by selling it to other investor at a higher price. But that investor is buying that stock from the first to also make money, by selling it to others at a higher price. And if everyone is buying GOOG stock to sell it to someone else at a higher price, then what real value GOOG stocks have?

If you come to Alphabet Inc, and show them your 1700$ stock and told them to repay it, they will pay you 0.001$ US Dollars.

So the only way you can make money, is by taking money generated by new investors.

Definition of a Ponzi Scheme: “A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. Ponzi schemes eventually bottom out when the flood of new investors dries up and there isn't enough money to go around. At that point, the schemes unravel.” So if GOOG is a ponzi scheme, when do investors dry up and the scheme is unraveled like other Ponzi schemes? The unraveling gets hidden, because It is masked as a bubble burst.

When the new investors stop buying stocks, last investors holding that stock cannot sell them at a higher price and the price of the stock crushes, we call it a bubble burst.

If GOOG doesn’t give any money to its investors, and only source of money for investors are new investors, than it’s a zero sum game. Like a gambling game with other people, but with fees attached to be able to play at a casino, in this case Google.

But it isn’t advertised as a gambling, GOOG is advertised as an investment by Alphabet, making clueless investors buy GOOG stocks, not knowing that its just a zero sum gambling. This is at the edge of criminality. I don’t even know how is it legal.

The simple truth is, GOOG is a Ponzi scheme, being advertised as an investment, when in reality it’s a zero-sum gambling game where the winners are those who sell them first before others, and if everyone knew that it was a zero sum gambling, GOOG stock price would crush right now and no one would want to buy it anymore. This is outrageous.

"3-21-22 SPY Daily TAI think we have all come to agree that JPOW at this point just really needs to STFU. But here we are yet again another day and some fuckery afoot. Its getting a little exhausting at this point. But what we saw today was essentially JPOW reiterate that he is very hawkish (the exact same stand point he had at the testimony 2 or 3 weeks ago and pretty much the same stand point last Wednesday) but for some reason today the markets decided it was time to panic. We saw about a dip from 444.56 all the way down to 440.68 before we finally saw a recovery end of day back up to 444.39 to close. SPY closed at -0.03% which technically makes it a red day but overall really didn’t feel very red. 

The morning movement of SPY was very up and down also with some very unexpected trend reversals.  

https://preview.redd.it/z4l0dtvjqto81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f46c74acd81e23e897fd4c03d60b53a57d56f21

Going into tomorrow it will be Important to keey an eye on the intraday high around 446 and the lows near 441. Those should be key support and resistance to watch as the day essentially while bearish ended in a sideways manner. 

What truly is impressive is that the VIX opened at 25.14 and closed at 23.54, dropping a full $2 without SPY moving upward and still finishing green. The VIX compared to SPY very much so under-reacted to the JPOW news today. 

To be honest I actually don’t care if SPY goes all the way back to 480 or if it goes to 400. What I really just want is for SPY to go back to its normal trends where you can actually play it how it looks and not get burnt by a big green dildo candle or a big fat red fuck you candle without any warning. The overall movement does not matter but when the intraday movement is nothing but fuckery it is quite annoying. Volume wise we once again failed to meet the average turning in only 88.3 million for yet again another extremely low volume day. This is the lowest volume day since February 16th. The first sub 90mil day in over a month. 

https://preview.redd.it/tv8nxtilqto81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500bb803be1eba98e0190710628684d58c6229a7

Now the daily does tell a bit of a deeper story…. 

It’s a little hard to tell in this pic because of the post market blue dotted line but the daily finished in a DOJI which COULD signal a reversal. Which after 4 massive red days would make sense… I mentioned Friday and this morning that today and tomorrow were going to be very telling of where this is going over the next few weeks. Unfortunately we didn’t get much direction. But the fact that JPOW once again told the market hey you idiots shits really bad and we really shouldn’t be bull running and these are the reasons why and the market said oh shit you are right for like an hour then said nah fuck that we actually are good to go for the bullrun says a lot… IF what JPOW said today isn’t going to tank the market then honestly I don’t really know what is going to stop it from going back to 460 outside of maybe a surprised rate hike or the next inflation number being 5x worse or something crazy. This market just doesn’t wanna be held down anymore. 

Today though we did close BELOW the 100 EMA at 445.08 (but broke it at one point in the morning). We also found support at the 50 EMA at 440.58 when we had the massive sell off. The fact that this didn’t break through the 50 EMA is quite bull telling if you ask me. But tomorrows finish will be telling. Looking at this chart currently IF we break through the 100 EMA over night at all or tomorrow intraday I would not be surprised to see this push towards 458 to retest the double top from February by the end of the week. IF we can break through 458 there really is nothing stopping this from 470 or 480 within the next few weeks. It wouldn’t shock me one bit to see with the VIX continuing to fall and this continuing to run this break through 458 in the next few days and inevitably retouch 470s by April.

The only thing I forsee to bring this down is either the US stepping into the physical war itself in Russia, Russia attacking the US, or MAYBE once the next CPI data drops and the next FOMC happens and we hit a recession officially. But  honestly we may be so recovered by then that we just have a minor dip back down 460 from 470 or 480 and return to the top after its priced in. 

Overall I would NOT encourage ANYONE to bet against the market right now. My tone may change tomorrow if by some miracle bears can get this to gap down and close BELOW the daily 200 ema at 438.18 and the daily 50 ema at 440.58. Until then im riding the 8ema wave bull train to the top. 

As JPOW once said “Fuck your Puts.”

"$TSLA to $400 DD inside“Oh, hello”, Elon Musk says, putting a coaster under his mug of dry Cheerios and placing it on the table. “I didn't see you there.”

He looks you directly in the eye. “But you've seen me everywhere, haven't you?” A film projects behind him. Images of rockets exploding, one 65 million dollar failure after another.

“I staked my career on colonizing mars. But now my shame will no longer define my legacy. This is the day a Muskrat will rise from the ashes, adorned in its Tesla flightsuit, and ascend to immortality.”

The film changes. Images of people, their eyes wide with fear or caution, like they've never seen a camera before.

“Uncontacted indigenous people.” He pours milk into his Cheerios. “The last human beings on Earth who've never had contact with the civilized world.” He’s still pouring the milk. “But what good are people who don't purchase goods and perpetuate the menstruation-like cycle of innovation?” The milk is overflowing from the mug, leaking off the table and into his lap. The heat radiating from his boardshorts evaporates the fluid into steam on contact.

“So I asked myself, what would our heavenly father do?” He removes his shirt to reveal an elaborate crucifixion tattoo across his veiny, throbbing pectorals, his sandy brown chest hair growing around it in patches. His left nipple replaces the head of Longinus, his right the head of Mary Magdalene.

“And do you know what he told me?” He grabs you by the hand. “Do you know the universal secret?” He briefly fondles your breasts, but you push him away, flirtatiously mouthing no, no, no. You know you want him. But you don't remember how you got here. You don't remember your name. You remember nothing but Elon.

The film changes. Images of an enormous armored vessel. Militaristic on the outside, the interior exudes elegance; full bar, kitchen, gaming tables, and a huge, impenetrable observation window.

“Our Father, through his only-begotten son, came before me in a dream. The Almighty and the Christ sat side-by-side in the holiest of holies, the inner sanctum, not of heaven, but of meaning itself. And behold, I saw the Mammon. Truly I say to you, the three were not in bitter dispute, but united together, each an introgial piece of the Holy Trinity, the base-most expression of God.”

“And what did God say to you, big boy?” You say, playing footsie with his milk-soaked black business socks.

“Ignorant harlot!” He screams, throwing the mug of Cheerios and milk in your face. “Do you desire my milk so badly, you can not discern for yourself God’s message from this vision?” You shake your head no, ashamed you've displeased your master.

He rubs your head, massaging the milk on his hands deep into your scalp. “Child, do you wish to possess this esoteric knowledge?”

“Yes, Papi Musk”, you say. Your conscious mind awakens as you realize you have no control of your actions, words, or emotions. “Your lessons begin now”, he says, loosening the drawstring on his shorts.

You pull his shorts off and see a large pink udder with four teets stuffed into his Teen Titans Go! boxer-briefs. You lovingly guide a teet through the folds. It's already dripping with pre-milk. “Suck it”, he says, grabbing your hair and pulling you closer. You obey your master and begin suckling. His warm milk squirts down your throat.

“Everybody has a place in the system”, he says. “as ordained by God’s laws of nature. Even when they seem lost and useless, He appoints a prophet to help them—to do His will.” His milk is getting warmer and more viscous.

“Truly I say to you, that prophet will channel the Mammon, and through him all people will find their purpose.” His piping hot milk globs down your throat and scalds your esophagus, but you can't let go of the teet.

“The Tesla Amphibious Observation Vessel. Now the world’s leaders and innovators have a window into the lives of primitive man, commodifying their existence and finally giving them purpose.”

The film changes. Images of the vessel in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit—crushing cars, busses, and people while Elon, Jeff Bezos, Charles Koch, Oprah Winfrey, and Kanye West peer out the observation window.

“Everyone has a place in the system” he says.

Every single piece of data you can find on the topic makes it very clear we are running toward the edge of a cliff. IMO the only way through the inevitable supply crisis is some sort of gas stimulus, at the moment the average American consumes 500 gallons of gas a year and [average price has gone up from 3.27](https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/gas-costs-hundreds-more-for-average-american/) to [4.27](https://gasprices.aaa.com/) in 6 months. Average salary is 50k, so that is 1% of people's money, at some point people will start demanding wages to go up which is going to make wage/price spiral worse

And I mean we're already seeing [different forms of gas stimulus](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/us/gas-tax-cuts.html), and remember this is an election year so [why not make it rain](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/04/29/2022-gas-stimulus-checks/9585306002/?gnt-cfr=1)

"Don't forget: AMZN is doing a historic 20-for-1 stock soonAs the title says, AMZN is gonna do a historic 20-for-1 split and its finally coming. I want to be part of history. I think this is bullish despite the mess the market is currently in. A bear market rally is over due as well. This could align the stars to make AMZN a good swing trade until after the split.

So when is it exactly?

https://investorplace.com/2022/03/when-is-the-amazon-stock-split-date-what-will-happen-to-amzn-stock/

&gt; The first will be May 27, 2022, which will serve as the record date. That means if you want to participate in the stock split, you must own AMZN stock by May 27. Individual accounts will start to update to reflect the stock split by June 3, 2022. Finally, AMZN will start trading on what is called a split-adjusted basis by June 6, 2022. That is when investors will start to notice the lower share price.

I'm pretty sure there's gonna be plenty of confusion about the record date and the ""must own"" phrasing of the above text, but this date doesn't really matter since its just for accounting purposes and the right to the new shares just transfers if you sell/buy after record date:

&gt; Record date: This is an important date when it comes to accounting, but it isn't terribly important for investors to know. The record date is when existing shareholders need to own the stock in order to be eligible to receive new shares created by a stock split. However, if you buy or sell shares between the record date and the effective date, the right to the new shares transfers. 

So, the effective date is the important date though:

&gt;Effective date: The date when the new shares show up in investors' brokerage accounts and the shares trade on a split-adjusted basis.

You can just google ""AMZN split effective date"" and it should show June 6 as well. So next week is the last week AMZN trades above 2000 and then it will trade at 1/20 the price and everyone is made whole by having 20x the amount of shares.

What about options?

The OCC will also automatically adjust the strike prices and for each option you hold you get 20x options of the new strike price on the effective date.

That means if you are getting calls divide them by 20 to see if you're getting a nice round number. A 2200 call would be 20x 110 calls on June 6. A 2105 call would get you weird 105.25 call options that might have liquidity problems later.",1

* What I’ll be watching on Friday:
   * Like to see support establish at 450.66 (if we get there).
   * Like to see if buyers come in at 447.67 (if we get there).
   * Be cautious with calls with divergences on RSI, MACD, and algos.
   * 1-Day Netflow gives me pause with calls. I’m anticipating some downside tomorrow. We shall see.
   * Refer to the *2 -Day Uptrend to Rectangle* pattern below and play levels!
      * Key for bulls to hold rectangle support tomorrow (444.83)(if we get there). Lose 4444 and 440 could come quick.
* We closed above the 21 EMA (15 min) and the 200 EMA (15 min.)
   * 21 EMA currently sits at 448.8
   * 200 EMA currently sits at 446.27
* Daily RSI - bullish. 65 min RSI - bullish - near overbought. 15 min. RSI - bullish near overbought.
* Bearish diversion on the 15 min. for what it’s worth.
* Algo Flow - 1 Day - Diversion at 447 - possible downside target. Something to keep an eye on.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks in the United States rallied the most in nine months, with major averages rising at least 2% on hopes that the omicron variant will not derail global growth.
* Treasuries fell, causing two-year yields to reach their highest level since March 2020.
* The rebound was led by technology stocks, which led the decline last week. The Nasdaq 100 index increased by 3%, an etf that tracks newly public companies increased by 5%, and small caps increased by 2%. The S&amp;P 500 recovered all of the losses suffered following Jerome Powell's hawkish stance a week ago, and was only 0.3% lower than its previous close before the Omicron variant shook markets.
* The CBOE volatility index fell five points to 22. In New York, the dollar fell and crude oil rose above $71 per barrel.
* Risk assets are recovering this week after preliminary data showed that the surge in omicron cases has not overwhelmed hospitals and China moved to expand economic support. A Goldman Sachs group basket of non-profitable technology firms rose nearly 6% on Tuesday, recouping nearly half of last week's losses.
* In terms of data, the US trade deficit shrank, while third-quarter productivity fell. Private consumption was the most important driver of the eurozone's most recent economic expansion.

#### Commentary:

* Nice run today from the Bulls.
* I still maintain that we will see a Christmas rally if Bulls hold 462.
* Depending on futures 469.71 - 468.69 may act as support or resistance (pointed out on gap analysis chart)
* Best case for Bulls tomorrow is they establish and hold support at 469.71 - 468.69 for more upside.
* Base case for Bears is they fill all of the gap (463.68 - 460.59 - 459.15) tomorrow as quickly as possible.
* **Expecting a dip tomorrow - look for gap fill to hold for downside risk**

## Gap Analysis - 65 min

"Expect AMD to continue to gain datacenter market share.Analysts expect AMD to eat in to Intel’s market share with its planned launch next year of chips with a tiny 7 nanometers between transistors.

Intel chips have 14 nanometers between transistors, indicating potentially slower speed. There is some dispute about the measurements, with analysts saying Intel’s numbers are better than headline figures convey, but AMD appears to have secured a lead for 2019.

Moreover, Intel will not launch its own 10-nanometer chips in PCs until late 2019, with server chips coming in 2020.


Now in regards to data centers, we see a 9.4% growth rate per annum. 


Now you have to take into account two things every tech virgin knows intel shit the bed with the i9. Every gamurrr knows it’s all about the ryzen. Those nerds are the guys who make the calls on what chip they’re going to use at the company’s new data center.

Already we’re seeivg intel losing chunks of market share, primarily due to straight up replacement because of the security issues.

"BB/AMZN Speculation Part 3: Drones confirmedIn case you missed it, here are [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhooz1/bbamzn_speculation_blackberry_ivy_for_the/) and [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li6gf1/bbamzn_speculation_part_2_forget_cars_its_was_all/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) of my speculation that Amazon's partnership with BB extends well beyond simply developing IVY to sell to automakers. I believe they are working together on Amazon's long overdue Prime Air fleet which will give BB access to autonomous flight data from hundreds of thousands of drones. This will put them years ahead of any evtol manufacturer or rtos developer and secure a monopoly in endpoint management for virtually anything on the IOT and is capable of moving vertically.

Today, BlackBerry was featured at Morgan Stanley Technology's media conference. Charles Eagan (BB's Chief Tech Officer) answered a bunch of questions about security, IVY, QNX, end-point management etc. [Link to Webcast](https://morganstanley.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1430549&amp;tp_key=381e2505f3). (Drones mentioned at 18 minutes)

When asked about drones, Charles said: ""we are not allowed to talk about which vendors are using which tech,"" and ""there is a number of active drone engagement that are happening""

This practically confirms my theory that 1) IVY is being developed for not just ground based vehicles but flying ones as well and 2) they are working on it with some degree of secrecy.

Amazon's drone fleet running on IVY will a great catalyst for BB share price... and that announcement can come at anytime. There is also some speculation going on about potential acquisition of BB, which isn't that far-fetched considering how John Chen joined Sybase in 1998, reinvented the company, and sold it to SAP a decade later.

"The bull market ends this year, thanks to Trump. He might escalate the current trade war, start a real war in North Korea to distract the country from the results of the Mueller investigation, and send SPY puts and the VIX to the moon. [Serious post]This past week has been interesting in the markets. Today and yesterday especially. 

We have a president who is not afraid to set the world on fire, so to speak. He has no qualms about destroying the current world order (which has been so good to commerce and the stock market so far). 

Trump's first year was marked by restraint, thanks to his advisers. A tax bill was drawn up and passed, and no one went to war. However, as he has gotten more comfortable with the authority vested to him as President, it appears that Trump's darker instincts have taken hold. And as we all know, one of Trump's most consistent views is his disdain for international trade and desire for autarky. 

We got a trade war this week. I do not believe that Trump will let down or is actually bluffing. Even if the Chinese offer to negotiate, I doubt Trump actually wants to negotiate. He believes that tariffs will force America to make its own stuff again. That is the true aim of this trade war, it's to dissuade firms from importing from abroad and make their own stuff, and employ American workers in the process, to bring about America's former manufacturing prowess. 

It is a fundamental ideological view he has held for more than 30 years. We need to sell more to other nations, and attain a high degree of self-sufficiency. That is how countries ""win"" at trade. 

Trade wars are devastating. I believe that Trump will escalate the matter further. He does not believe in negotiating, only brow-beating. May 1st is an important date to watch, as it's the date that the exemptions to steel tariffs ends for certain countries like Canada, Mexico, the EU, South Korea, et al. 

The result of a trade war is increased inflation, as consumers pay more to get their stuff. Increased inflation will pressure the Fed to raise rates more quickly than anticipated, and with that goes economic growth and the bull market. Banks are especially under pressure. While increased rates help net interest revenue, if fewer people are borrowing as a result, why would it even matter?

The second threat to the bull market is political instability from the 2018 mid-terms and the Mueller investigation. Trump feels threatened by these two things. If Democrats take back the House, they can start restraining him a little. Mueller could release a report that puts Trump in a poor light and perhaps recommend him for impeachment. Trump is an authoritarian, and does not believe in accountability from other government institutions. What might he do to draw attention away from these things? He could start a war. 

With hawks like Pompeo and Bolton on board, I believe that Trump will launch some sort of first strike on North Korea to distract everyone from the results of Mueller's investigation and undercut Congressional authority in the name of ""national security"". 

The results of a Second Korean War? Supply chains to Asia will be disrupted, an important trading partner will have its economy flushed down the toilet, and increased government spending to fund such a war will stretch the United States' financial resources to the limit. 

Look at the charts from yesterday and today. Massive downward selling pressure on high volume towards the end of the day. BTFD is seemingly gone. The market is nervous about the possible things President Trump could do and is re-pricing assets accordingly. 

Conservatively, there's not much one can do. If you are long call options, it's time to GTFO. If you are long stock, and have a time horizon of more than 10 years, it's fine to continue holding (but it will bleed in the meantime). 

If you are 100% cash, I recommend that you stuff 75% of it into a savings account. Use the other 25% to sell long-dated OTM bear call spreads, purchases of long-dated index puts, or long-dated VIX calls. Perhaps even gold mining stocks if you like gold, since it's always a safe haven. 

Tread carefully.

"5-24-22 SPY Daily Ta (FOMC minutes prediction)Another day of SIKE, can we agree to nickname SPY SIKEY instead? It think it fits the narrative much better currently… 

&amp;#x200B;

One would assume that opening down nearly 1% would all but guaranteed some sort of massive bear trend right? Well you would be wrong to assume anything in this market. For about the last month or so it really seems like we get about 1 good day a week that has a nice beautiful solid trend that we can follow and the rest are full of these 6-8 reversals and massive wicks and pumps/ dumps and fakeouts. Which makes it nearly impossible to trust those other strong trend days. 

Until the last hour of the day the range was 388 to 393 which is a range we have seen many times before. However bulls were able to break her out above that EOD but failed to close over the key 395 resistance for the next channel. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another user in my server posted a tweet that had this symmetrical breakout triangle right here. Overall this uses the peak of May 17th and May 23rd for resistance and support from May 20th and today. I can see the pattern however what I see more clearly and more important is the blue dotted resistance line for this 15min bear channel. This channel as you see below goes all the way back to beginning of April. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/68fkreyfki191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5921e6cee3a64e44f45787cf8e9199eb4a7bedaf

397-398 will be key resistance level to watch pre market tomorrow and at open tomorrow. If we break above that and hold above that level especially if we see a big move like 400 on the 15 min this MIGHT be the bulls attempt at a bear market rally.

I left my blue arrows up which show the channel resistance touches. Overall we have not had an official touch since May 4th (FOMC day).

On the VIX to go along with the 28 to 34.8 channel I mentioned last night we are coming to a decision point. We have been making higher lows since April 21st and making lower highs since May 2nd. We are going to see a massive SPIKE in the vix or a massive DUMP in the vix potentially as early as tomorrow. 

Bull case- On arguably an easy lob to bears they failed to maximize losses today. The ViX only momentarily broke 31 before closing basically exactly where it opened. Despite the lower volume today bulls were able to but a 180 reversal on SPY today and prevent it from seeing 385 support again. Looking at May 19th there is a 387 double bottom in play. With FOMC minutes tomorrow if there are no surprises the markets could use this as a rallying point as there is not much new news for the next two weeks till we have CPI June 10th and FOMC June 15th. If bulls can get momentum this is there best shot at a 2 week rally. 393 has been a key support range for SPY and being able to close above that today should allow for a pop to the next resistance at 398 tomorrow. Todays daily candle finished in a dragonfly doji. Most of the time this is a reversal candle and could signal upside the next day. 

Bear case- despite opening down 1% after the first hour it appears that SPY essentially realized there was an over reaction to all the earnings news. The VIX is still hanging out at its lower level near 29 which gives it a higher upside potential tomorrow especially if it holds that support line its been using to make higher lows. The daily dragonfly doji candle can be signaled as a revesal candle IF its at the bottom of a down trend. So think 3 red days in a row with the last being a dragonfly doji (look at May 2nd and really even May 12th for examples) but when the dragonfly doji is after a run up it could signal a loss of momentum and could cause a reversal back down. We closed the daily candle fully under the 8ema today of 396.03 and with the red bear channels resistance at 398 tomorrow (the same one as the 15minute) if we see a hard rejection there tomorrow morning at open we might get further downside throughout the day. The best bear case however would be a morning dump to test 387 if not lower closer to say 385 before we see a massive recovery EOD (probably due to fomc minutes) that results in a huge hanging man candle like we have seen 3 other times now ( April 21, May 4th and May 17th). Yesterdays and Fridays price action failed to break through the 398 resistance level and its pretty arguable that we can expect that resistance to hold strong. 

I posted it last night but the last two FOMC minutes have seen a morning dump followed by rally. 

February 16th pre market had a massive gap up to 447.75 before falling all the way to 443.93 at open (-0.8%). From open SPY dropped from its high of 444.81 to a low of 441.94 at 1230 (-0.7%). However it held a range of 442.7 to 443.7 from pretty much 945 am to 2pm when FOMC minutes dropped. Once minutes dropped SPY went from a low of 442.02 to a high of 448.06 EOD (+1.3%). IT should be noted that spy closed at 446.61 on the 16th and dropped all the way to 437.11 the next day for a drop of (2.2%) the following day… Interestingly enough the VIX dropped all the way to 24 on the 16th only to end up back near 28 the following day before market closed…

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nmzkm3iki191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ab2ebb1df42f83bc2793def608189ad4d8fcaf

April 6th FOMC minutes is much different though. Pre market saw a high of 451.27 at open before it immediately sold off until 8am hitting a low of 446.51 (-1.1%), however the 8am candle saw a huge spike to 451.11 (1.1%) before it then held the 446.51 range till open. At open spy dropped from a high of 447.59 to a low of 444.5 at 1215am (-0.7%). SPY held range most of the day and then saw a pop to opening price before FOMC minutes at 2pm. Now this one saw a MUCH different reaction and arguably this is the reaction we have gotten recently for fed stuff. Which is a spike up, a massive drop, then a massive recovery EOD. SPY shot up to 448.53 then immediately dropped to 443.47 by 230 (-1.1%) then rocketed to 448.93 (+1.2%) right before power hour before it dropped back to 445.32 (-0.8%) and recovered to close at 446.57 after another spike near 448. Interestingly enough the next day also saw a fairly large drop intraday from close of 446.57 to lows of 443.53 (-1.1%) before a MASSIVE v shaped recovery to 450.69 EOD (+1.6% from the V bottom). 

&amp;#x200B;

Both days saw a -0.8 to -1.1% open and both days then saw a -0.7% drop at open before holding range most of the day.  Unlike the last few FOMC and CPI which have been fairly predictable to be honest I feel like FOMC minutes are not nearly as easy to track. It seems fairy safe to expect a drop in pre market (though we see that spy is now up +0.42% AH) and then expect a 0.7% drop pretty much immediately at open which then leads to a range bound day all day till 2pm. 

This could look like a -1% open= 389.95 at open followed by a 0.7% drop 387.22 range holding until we see FOMC minutes. This is quite interesting to me because we saw intraday today that 387 was such a strong support and we very well MAY retest that in the morning it appears. While this is 100% speculation I will be curious to see how this all plays out in the AM

10% challenge-

Overall it was one of those days that started out GREAT and would have ended great if I stopped trading at 10am… we had some odd massive spikes in volume today and one of my puts got burnt really bad in the AM and then when it appeared we were dropping below 388.2 support I entered another put that too would get burnt. Overall one of those days where the reversal is hard to believe and doesn’t really match the technical. The strength of the sell pressure this morning should not have allowed what we saw today. Nonetheless we live to trade another day. It was another one of those days that had we just taken profits at 5-8% profits all day we woulda been making bank.

Unfortunately ended up marrying some puts over night… hoping my prediction is correct and we see a drop near 385 to 387 to be able to exit at less of a loss tomorrow. Despite AH being green I think there is some fear in FOMC minutes after what happened at the WSJ interview. However, I have fully accepted the fate of these puts. I had an opportunity to exit them on that fake out 245pm sell off and failed to do so. That sell off was very convincing and in a normal market we should have continued back to the LOD not made a new HOD during power hour. That is one of the reasons I do wonder if the bulls are going to be back in control for a while here.

3. Advisory vote to approve executive compensation - AGAINST. Will obviously pass but I will vote against as compensation is ridiculous. Working for Apple is a privilege and if you’re not willing to work for it there for base pay instead of full comp package, then maybe you shouldn’t work there in the first place.

5. A shareholder proposal entitled “Reincorporate with Deeper Purpose” - AGAINST. Smells like California bullshit that will cripple Apple’s ability to move fast. 

6. A shareholder proposal entitled “Transparency Reports” - FOR. We need to know what Apple is up to China . This will hurt the company financially but is the right thing to do from a human rights point of view.

7. A shareholder proposal entitled “Report on Forced Labor” - FOR. It is against everything Apple stands to benefitting from inhumane labor conditions. Would you want your own children to work for an Apple supplier? Probably not. Then you should for this.

8. A shareholder proposal entitled “Pay Equity” - AGAINST. Apple already knows how to pay people who are crucial to the operation. That’s what pay should based on.

"3/7/22 SPY Pre-market3/7/22 Pre Market SPY

If this isn’t just the classic SPY I don’t know what is. How many times have we seen futures either open with a massive gap down or be extremely red only for it to be 100% recovered and flat by open? Time and Time again this happens…. So how do we play today if this is the classic SPY movement? Well lets get into it.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6gk8b9elzyl81.png?width=1502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ee9f7c05b680d0e3270793690f511e7a5081fab

 As you can see futures bottomed out near 4239 and has recovered as of about 15 minutes ago to completely fill its gap near 4315. That’s quite the impressive range for Futures and is something I myself will watch today for some guidance of our range… 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eksjcxymzyl81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99e5de1dd80f31a5d6ab707450dd200f0811b543

Take a look at this SPY 1 hour chart what do you see? I see two major channels that we have formed one downward and one upward. The downward channels upper resistance currently sits near 440 and the lower support sits near 395. 

https://preview.redd.it/01hwd96pzyl81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a1bcdc1c094bed7de9390caeb9b0465fd06e590

Okay now lets zoom it and see where we are at within this channel…

Pre-market put us opening out of the upward channel that you can see on the 1 hour… but some of you will say but its pre market it doesn’t matter! But doesn’t it? Doesn’t all movement matter when SPY and /ES are connected? If your answer is anything but yes you are doing your investments a disservice. We have to watch everything and factor it in. So this upward channel is broken which tells me we are going to start pushing towards that lower limit of the support line near sub-400 next. 

Here what I will be watching today. We did see a massive recovery but does that mean its time to buy calls? No. Okay… well we had a massive gap fill its absolutely time to buy puts right? No…. We wont know the game plan till this opens. My bias would lean towards retesting those Futures lows near 424 but we wont know where we are going until 930 when this opens and starts moving. 

&amp;#x200B;

Key levels to watch-

Support- 429.8  428.5  427.8 (Fridays intraday low)  427.1 (the low from March 1st)  425.2  424.2 (pre market low  423.5 (pre-market 8am wic low)  421.4 ( the low from Feb 23 and the mid point of the grey channel) 

\-0.5%= 430

\-1%= 427.8

\-1.5%= 425.7

\-2%= 423.5

Resistance- 431.2 (currently pre market resistance high)  431.9  432.6  433.3 (Fridays intraday high)  434.2 (8 EMA daily)  435.2  436.4  437.4 (resistance line from the high of feb 10th and Mar 3rd)   439.2 (200 ema daily)   439.7   445 (upper resistance of the channel)

0.5%= 434.3 

1= 436.5

1.5%= 438.7

2%= 440.8 

&amp;#x200B;

10% challenge-

Remember as we go live today… the goal is to make ONE good trade the nets us at least 10%. We do not need make 10 trades a day to get our 10% that is over trading. We need to just be smart about how we invest. We have to wait for our trend. We have to wait for our perfect entry. We do not force trades. If we are patient our trade will come.

"AMD News is priced in...I literally know nothing about AMD and am pretty tech illiterate so take my advice with a grain of salt. I’m seeing two camps around AMD: those who know technology who think AMD is going to be super hot and give intel a run for their money and those who think it’s “pRiCeD iN” already.

This reminds me a lot of Dominos Pizza to be honest... Back at the tail end of the financial crisis, some friends of mine saw that Dominos (DPZ) had finally come to their senses and changed how they did business- they turned their production process and recipes on their head in order to actually make a product that people wanted to buy and weren’t just “satisfied that they bought a cheaper alternative to better pizza”. Except for the pizza part, does this Sound familiar? 

So anyway, DPZ had gone from $4 to $11 as they went from near bankrupt to actually competitive with a good product. We bought in at about $11 once the product was getting good feedback. We SOLD it at $13-14 after scalping a 20% gain. We figured the good news and the improved product was pRiCeD iN already, we had made our money, and the stock had essentially tripled in a year. 

Whoa were we wrong. Every time the stock doubled or tripled we said it was priced in already and there was no point in buying it back because the trend was likely over soon because pizza is competitive and there is no moat and well funded competitions...

Anyway- this situation just reminded me of what I’m seeing arguing about AMD. If they really are making a better product than the competition (I’m too stupid to understand if that’s true or not), ride the freaking wave.",0

"4-11-22 SPY (AMD, QQQ, F, Apple, VIX) Daily TA  

The day before CPI… the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my -2% red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20, 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days. 

The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesn’t have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema (above for bearish and below for bullish).

We actually established yet another downward channel today that I don’t suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse.

We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse. 

But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I don’t really forsee (unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10% that we do it) but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.

The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/14m0bnhuqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb628bb79afa7a42f5d89e96ee5161666ca6c136

The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20, 50 and 100 ema on the daily (445.21, 446.55 and 446.63) but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised (again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected) for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside. 

Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 (unlimited upside) BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I don’t suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b7xoaqpvqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7116303960c6b14d65486a7a6055fe9d2f6ebe3b

Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However, we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema (443.96, 445.9). The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 (weekly 50). 

Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday (monthly option expiration). 

Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p. 

Thursday monthly has 15k 445c, 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p, 66k 435p, 113k 430p.

That is a massive amount of OI to the downside that’s expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps, we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too. 

With the last CPI being 7.5%, expected at 7.9% but the consensus at 8.4% its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war, gas prices, more covid, etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9%. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow.

Apple had a heck of a red day today too (mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today). I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not, however, expect it to happen today. However, I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning. 

Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel, with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However, my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here. 

Channel support tomorrow is 157 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However, if Apple loses 165.54 (daily 100ema) we can expect further downside this week. 

I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may re-enter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.

The blood for AMD just continues, but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive -5.2 hit which I believe it was down around -6% at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 72-74. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right. 

I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema (tomorrow most likely) to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h42lt6cyqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=656bccd6c7693ffbff25068cf8b80b2484feb77c

Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5%, however, after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.

Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I don’t suspect the RSI to be an issue. 

Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position. 

&amp;#x200B;

QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how. 

Channel support is 322 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 342 for tomorrow. 

I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420-430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.

The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11% from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels, but mind you that was on the downside not the upside. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1dkbfa40rzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718eb38d4ea8f47c4467f046cff1e33dd4fed944

When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI. 

Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising, 30 year fixed mortgages rising again, the inverted treasury yields, inflation, covid, war, gas, etc. etc. etc. recession, etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two. 

While some don’t think it’s a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of... took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling that’s the pre-ample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19%, a spy put for 20% and a call for 20%. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70% at open that spiked to -30% around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at -30%. I also played a call and put for -25% then -10% during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10% puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal, however, factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.",1

"High priced stock will plummet unless a stock split happens. $tsla  

You can call me a conspiracy theorist, but this is true when it comes to availability in mathematics.

**Stock splits are to protect companies from sell offs and to provide a false sense of security.**

This is my logic for the above claim:

1.) Forget penny stocks for now. Stocks *in general* trade up to 2 decimal points, to the hundredths of a full number. 

2.) A stock trading at $100 before going to $0 has 10,000 leading prices that buyers and sellers can trade at before the stock is worth $0.

3.) A stock trading at $1000 has 100,000 leading prices that buyers and sellers can trade at before a stock is worth $0.

4.) A company’s current stock price is based off the last traded price.

*Assuming the company is not going bankrupt to $0 but the market is not doing well because of uncertainty, doubt, and fomo. You have the below.*

5.) At $1000, with 100,000 prices to sell at, people can get more competitive in selling.

6.) At $100, with 10,000 prices to trade at, there is less price action available.

How do you benefit from this in any way? 

High priced stock that has good volume and liquidity will sell down in bad times. With a stock split and a lower pricing, there is less volatility. Here’s a screener of high-priced stocks with average volume.

"10-19-22 SPY/ ES futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TAI believe a lot of people after Netlfix had the massive beat and rip after hours yesterday that with spy up almost 1% after hours that we would see a pretty green day. However, as I suspected futures called it with that gravestone doji yesterday and SPY with the hard rejection at 375 that we would see a retracement. Now the question is where do we go from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e64oqbpxvuu91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=150998e587a305bb672e5f55a753b682d0ddd8fd

We still have our phantom print down at 357 that needs to be filled at some point and until something bigger or better than that shows up I have no reason to suspect that we don’t fill that this week or next. 

We did break that v bottom recovery line and now are forming a nice falling wedge that gives support down at the 340s for this/ next week. 

The biggest bullish case here is that SPY did hard bounce off its daily 8ema and hold that support well. We once again saw a massive fight happening at 368.7 today and we did end up barely closing below it. As I was saying above 368 and until 378 is broken I would be looking for downside to retest that 356 to 360 area. 360 remains my next target and with Tesla missing earnings we should see that happen tomorrow or the next day. 

Key support- 363.9 -&gt; 359.9 -&gt; 356.5

Taking a look at futures here we can see a break through of the V bottom support and as of now we are rejecting that daily 20ema level. Overall I am seeing continued evidence of downside. The one thing I do want to see in order to believe in a retest of that 3585 level is that we break through and close below 3680 support tomorrow. That was a key bounce area today and a key previous resistance level. 

Support- 3680 -&gt; 3586

Apple overall doesn’t look terrible, but we saw once again a rejection of that key 143.8 level today and we saw a retest and rejection of the daily 20ema which should lead to more downside. 

With Tesla missing on earnings due to a beat of expectations but revenue short fall (I wish I could listened to the call to see what he had to say) I do wonder with Apples report of Iphone 14 production cut and now this tesla earnings if we see that trickle down to the rest of tech who reports next week. 

Key support- 141.6 -&gt; 138.2 -&gt; 135

Key resistance- 143.8 -&gt; 146.5

I had been saying pretty much all week that I expected tesla COULD beat earnings but give poor guidance which would result in a sell off and well that’s pretty much exactly what happened today. I was actually even more bearish on earnings today seeing yesterdays massive rejection followed by the daily 8ema rejection… its funny how the markets “know” when to not go too bullish ahead of time…

I will be watching key 205 support the most tomorrow and the rest of this week. If and when that support is broke/  closed below that is when I suspect tesla could start its descent to the 180s. 

Key support- 219.6 -&gt; 205.8

Key resistance- 223.6

The VIX once again gave us zero direction and zero guidance of what to expect. The biggest thing I am noting is that the fear in the markets is not unwinding. To me that means we are not quite read for the next wave up. 

I zoomed out a little bit so we could look back at the June bottom. If you see there is quite the difference between the two times. Once that June 16th 52 week low was in the VIX had already “peaked” and already was on its descent down. The touch of the VIX on June 16th had a huge wick and after that it was a straight sell off. 

The biggest difference is that on the current VIX trend is that we put a new low in on October 13th and about 1 or 2 days before that we “peaked” however we are not seeing the same level of sell off now that we did then. And the overall downward resistance line from that peak was broken today. 

The VIX is still holding that 20ema support and we are still in that danger zone of 28.4 to 33. I struggle to be truly bullish that the “bottom” is in and that we are going on a big rally until I see the vix break through that 28.4 support range. 

10% challenge-

Overall actually kind of a tough day to trade today. The biggest issue of the day was the IV and IV rank was so high from the previous day that the movements yesterday that were paying out an east 10-25% gains were barely paying 5% before it turned against you. It actually was very interesting to see how the premiums were moving today. 

A few times I noted in one specific Call play I was in that the price of SPY had fallen and fallen a decent amount where I definitely should have had my 20% stop loss hit, however, with the drop in SPY my call actually rose in value. Then once SPY did bounce my actual premium barely increased in value. It was almost like the actual movement of premiums was happening before the actual movement of SPY happened. I definitely caught a few plays where the technical setup of them looked perfect, however, caught a rogue bounce that stopped me out before I was able to capitalize. Overall a green day so no complaints but definitely a tough day to trade today.

"AMD strategy proposalGreetings fellow autists. I have a plan. I hope this reaches all 11 million retards here.
As we know we all use computers to trade, I propose, at least a million of us switch to AMD, and within this month (still Q2). And we also buy calls on AMD so we end up paying for the  AMD processors with our earnings. If this gets 1k upvotes I’m getting an AMD powered laptop right away. Those of you who don’t have a PC, just buy an AMD processor for you wife’s boyfriend anyways. I think if we create the demand ourselves, we can shake mountains with this strategy.
We need about 4 million new sales to increase the revenue by a billion. 
AMD’s biggest weapon is that it is taking the processor market from intel. If we succeed, not only are we boosting their revenue but also moving intel investors to AMD. Also we love Lisa Su

"How’s 2022 going with everyone? Here is mine a nutshell! And why I’ll go all in $NVDABack in mid December 2021 after the fed meeting the market had a rally, all my heavey tech based positions (all in blue chip tech, with no investments in ballooned uniform companies) recovered from the minor dip of November caused by omicron, from the meeting my takeaway was that the market will get oversold early 2022. I’ve then asked advice from a friend a trust with over 30 years of trading and his feedback was that worse case scenario is a 10-15% correction early 2022. I really wanted to liquidate and sit on cash to buy the real dip and avoid loosing my 20% gain from 2021. In the matter of 2 weeks early January I lost that 20% gain and lost 15% of my overall portfolio, out of dispersion I liquidated 30% of my overall positions and started betting on semis( due to the shortages a real opportunity is here) prior to their earnings with the 30% of my overall portfolio, this then did not go as planned and here’s how it went. 

ASML: lost 3 % on the 30% which is roughly 1.5% gain of overall portfolio
AMD: Made 13% on 20% of overall portfolio, roughly 2.5% 
GOOG: thought would have a solid quarter so 10% of portfolio was invested sold at 9% uptrend with .9% gain 
FB: with 13.5 % of overall portfolio invested through buying its dips took a hit at earnings, devastating to my overall portfolio with a 6% net loss on overall portfolio. 
QCOMM: invested 10% of portfolio and lost 2% post earnings. 

Here’s where shit starts ( continued on earnings plays ) 

I shorted Zillow and it rallied.. (shorted more at peak of rally) 
bought CLF and it tanked..

Next moves: 

NVDA 30% of overall portfolio

Shipping with Amazon will still be in beta for quite some time until amazon develops the infrastructure to be able to ship majority of their products and until then they're still heavily dependent on USPS, FDX and UPS.

Just looking historically at the weekly price fluctuation of SPY,  it seems recently to be about $4.5, with some high volatility. Has anybody here tried buying week-open atm  calls and puts? Seems like weekly fluctuation would favor the winning leg so hard that the loser wouldn’t matter. I’d sell the winner at 2-300% and ride the loser til expiry or sell it to cash in on remaining theta. You could also get riskier and widen the straddle too, or hold on to the bad leg in hopes for reversal.

"10-31-22 SPY/ ES Futues, Apple and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisHappy Halloween! What a frightfully boring day today was… This honestly was one of the worst choppy range days I have seen in months. The total range for today on SPY was $3.14… usually we see that level of movement on the opening candle of SPY. 

The question remains where are we headed? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sja1wwyjn7x91.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5af9d65c426d9ec3063ba7bd36ef14e1c078159a

Thank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4h1f3nekn7x91.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dce38d2bc2709e6acc983596099c37400eacd16

Today we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. 

Overnight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. 

Key support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378

Key resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.2 -&gt; 393

&amp;#x200B;

Futures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. 

Its not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.

Key support- 3870 -&gt; 3845 -&gt; 3800

Key resistance- 3925 -&gt; 3975

Not much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. 

Apple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. 

Key support- 151 -&gt; 148

Key resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.8 -&gt; 157.4

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mihozrtln7x91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=546ac9f63d50ed5dcbf5e669ff51ff97c092a9cb

Tesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. 

Until Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. 

Key support- 224.8 -&gt; 219.3

Key resistance- 230 -&gt; 234.2

You gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. 

Some of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. 

Overall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. 

FOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! 

10% challenge-

Today was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. 

I also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Closing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. 

I posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome.

Mostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely.

"Expect AMD to continue to gain datacenter market share.Analysts expect AMD to eat in to Intel’s market share with its planned launch next year of chips with a tiny 7 nanometers between transistors.

Intel chips have 14 nanometers between transistors, indicating potentially slower speed. There is some dispute about the measurements, with analysts saying Intel’s numbers are better than headline figures convey, but AMD appears to have secured a lead for 2019.

Moreover, Intel will not launch its own 10-nanometer chips in PCs until late 2019, with server chips coming in 2020.


Now in regards to data centers, we see a 9.4% growth rate per annum. 


Now you have to take into account two things every tech virgin knows intel shit the bed with the i9. Every gamurrr knows it’s all about the ryzen. Those nerds are the guys who make the calls on what chip they’re going to use at the company’s new data center.

Already we’re seeivg intel losing chunks of market share, primarily due to straight up replacement because of the security issues.

"6-15-22 SPY Daily TA (and FOMC trade review)Well another FOMC meeting day in the books. These days are both exciting and scary at the same time. They are some of the most volatile days we will see. MY friend sent me this image this morning that shows we are the 3rd worst performance ever through 112 trading days! YAY us! 

https://preview.redd.it/gcza2mzn2v591.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c9e930a6af81d607e6476bdebf453c0294cd0f

Okay I posted this trade breakdown last night as my anticipation of how to play FOMC today and then I posted this breakdown of where SPY should move intraday. Lets see how we did…

https://preview.redd.it/8jbuw9lo2v591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1d4e85d577314d58f6ae025ba4921f841473eb

https://preview.redd.it/1iuygw2p2v591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53124fd369f1851f244bc6ccc4c7fb8f61a665d3

We fake ripped to 379.98 (0.48%) and then dropped by 230pm 372.12( 1.6% from 2pm candle open) and then we rallied to 383.9 (3.1%) from 230pm till EOD. This thing played out almost exactly as anticipated. 

For me I was able to capitalize on call bought on the 230pm run up when JPOW started talking. I got nervous and didn’t buy in at 372 like I told myself I would buy at the low made at 235pm and watched my qued call go up 50% before my eyes in about 5 seconds. I bought in around 375 and rode some 378C up. I had initially set a 100% take profit order but got nervous of a massive recoil on that nearly 2% candle (which did end up happening the next candle) and went ahead and set a 10% trailing stop loss when I was up 80% unfortunately due to volatility it triggered and hit me with a 56.5% gainer. While still amazing… I left a lot on the table. BUT I protected myself from downside loss which is most important being that this was a full port (hehe oops), however, had I waited about 15 seconds longer my 100% take profit would have triggered. 

Also I mentioned in my night TA I was going to PAPER TRADE a strangle to see how that behaved. Both positions were opened at 130pm and by 2pm I would have been able to close both for 25% gains. I also saw both positions hit 50-60% profits but that was it. 

Next FOMC I will be playing a strangle with 5 OTM strikes with 30% TP set at open. I will then wait until 230pm when JPOW starts talking for the bottom/ top to be in and enter calls or puts. 

you know whats really wild... the fact that the feds actually leaked exactly what they were going to do before the meeting... i mean thats nuts they are that scared of the market crashing that they went ahead and leaked the plans during a fed quiet time so that the markets could price it in...

https://preview.redd.it/e6oh6lwp2v591.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37cfc97a22e7136a3829764a5795d315b1c91c7a

The one funny thing about todays HOD… is that it was 8 cents away from getting SPY out of a bear market, however, we hard rejected there and never made a new high or even retested it. So where does this all leave us?

https://preview.redd.it/2v3a1vdq2v591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2df949354b26c8bdb60debc7e417730e4bf29cf

We now actually have a symmetrical triangle which is known as a breakout/ breakdown pattern forming on the daily. With back to back DOJIs and today technically being considered a dragonfly doji (bullish) then we might actually be in store for some further upside here. Today we did chip away at $2.09 of the $7.89 gap that was left on the daily. 

We now have a $5.66 and a $5.80 gap left on the daily to be filled. The $5.8 is the closest gap at 389.75. There is a pretty good case here that SPY could fill that gap tomorrow which would require a 2.78% green day tomorrow which is definitely gonna be hard to do and would require the VIX to unwind from 30 to 25 minimum to do it. 

The one thing I am watching on the daily is that the Monday candles body stopped at 380 which makes it a resistance line to watch. Yesterdays candle failed to close above that resistance and today we also failed to close above it. This is a tough spot to be in as there is an equal case to be made that we break through 380 to gap fill tomorrow and there is an equal case that we partial gap filled today and will retest support down near 370 on the daily. 

https://preview.redd.it/5j91uvwq2v591.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d4a983d66ef2f1bc58f85d305bdc467ead5afd7

Now if we factor in previous CPI data it is about a 66% chance we open red and see a red day tomorrow. If I had to take a wager I would say markets like May 4th over reacted to the JPOW news (hint- it was NOT bullish nor good for the economy or anything) and tomorrow will see an inversed move. 

10% challenge-

I was busy with the kiddos today in the morning and didn’t really look at the computer till noon which is fine cause I planned to leave all my BP for that 230pm move on SPY and it surely paid off well for me!

"SPY Timing SystemsHi folks.  I'm just starting this thread for those of us who try to time the overall market using ETFs like SPY.  I have developed a system that I use in part of one of my accounts that has been working well, so I thought I would share it with anyone who is interested.  

My goals with the system were:

1. To participate in longer-term market uptrends, but to step aside during downtrends (IOW, to engage in overall market timing), while at the same time,
2. To smooth out returns by scaling in and out as the market moves up and down along its uptrend path.

Another way to put that is that I wanted to combine value and momentum, but on an overall market basis rather than on a stock-by-stock basis as it is usually described.  

So, while SPY is in an uptrend I want to be onboard, but I want to reduce my exposure as it runs up toward overbought conditions.  Then, when it pulls back, I want to increase my position to take advantage of the next runup.  Finally, when the short-term pullback turns into a longer-term drawdown, I want to get out completely and wait for the next longer-term uptrend.

I also want to do all of this without making any guesses, forecasting, following news, etc.  I want it to be a purely mathematical system that could be traded by a computer.  It took some time, but I finally worked it out and have been satisfied with the results.  

Anyway, without further adieu, here is where the system currently stands (I'll post every weekend with the latest signals, in the form of two questions with answers):

"6-8-22 SPY Daily TADespite probably one of the most uneventful and boring days ive ever seen on SPY today was a great day and also showed us quite a lot in my opinion. For the first 3 hours of the day SPY maintained the same $3.1 range that was established within the first 30 minutes of trading. The best opportunity of the day was the 1230 dump. From there we just consolidated within a $2.35 range the rest of the day. Overall an extremely uneventful and extremely boring day to trade. Pretty much all but about 30 minutes of the day was untradeable.

When we look at the daily chart I think the party is about to be over. We have a couple things forming here. We have that blue triangle which you can see we peaked on June 2nd at 417.44. From there we have now established a lower highs resistance line that has been rejected 4 times including today. In addition highlighted in a red dotted pattern you can see a VERY large ascending wedge which I anticipate we will break tomorrow and will lead to the downfall where we will see a retest of the 390s at minimum over the next 2 or 3 weeks. 

We also maintained that purple channel that I believe we will eventually see support break on it and that will be the time to play some longer dated puts. I think that time is coming very soon. 

I fully expect us to revisit 408 support tomorrow at a minimum if not lower closer to 405. Currently 406.4 is the support line of the current sideways channel (406.4 to 416.6). 

https://preview.redd.it/5kiimo0jbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36e03677135d5eb17c2df677918483e7ccb27d34

On the weekly we are seeing nearly a triple top (double top for sure) at 416. As long as SPY doesn’t close over 416 this week I fully anticipate the weekly to break that support line at 406.5 next week if not this week. 

https://preview.redd.it/stnadtzjbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a22e2d869d89f39e94443e26e044323df73c2ce0

I mentioned that the VIX was approaching its crucial support line yesterday in my TA and today I mentioned in my server that 23.8 was the key to watch. Well the VIX bounced right off 23.74 today and EOD failed to unwind back under 23.8 closing just below 24. 

https://preview.redd.it/o27nlenkbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286dc30095dd029ac5088285f7a5e2cc05b4bac7

I will be looking for the VIX to start its way back toward 30 tomorrow. With CPI coming only two days away now I suspect markets are going to start getting the fear back in. There has been a lot of chatter about this CPI and a lot from fed members to the point I think we are going to see a bigger miss then expect on CPI. I would be surprised to not see some of that fear set in tomorrow. I will be looking to see the VIX end of day near 25.5 and start its ascent up to 30 Friday and Monday next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/ojs3am9lbh491.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c202e0ad543621988fb095091d23f9d549e70354

Looking at the last few CPI releases you can see that surprisingly the last 4 of 5 CPI eves actually were green days with 2 of them being significantly green. However, the April 12th CPI we had a massively red day. Looking at the VIX trend For the April 12th CPI we actually saw the vix the week leading to CPI rise from 18.8 to 25. The May 11th CPI we saw the VIX go from 29 to 33 the day of CPI. Interestingly enough looking at the VIX trends 7days prior to CPI this is the first CPI we have seen the VIX unwind leading to CPI. We have over the last really month (actually the last CPI on May 11th) seen the VIX steadily unwind down to where we are not at 23.95. 

We have seen the VIX go from peak of 37 on May 2nd to current day at 23.95 and SPY has only gone from 380.54 (may 20th) to 417.44 (June 2nd) a 9.6% bull run. Oddly enough the same time it took the VIX to go from 34 (March 9th) to 24 (March 22nd) Spy also moved about 9% going from 415.12 to 450.58. 

I have two working theories. The first is that the fed and markets know CPI is finna be trash and its finna scare the fuck outta the market. We then have a follow up FOMC meeting only 3 trading days later. With these two major VIX spiking catalysts I have a theory that they purposefully have been slowly unwinding the VIX knowing come Friday, and next week the VIX is gonna rocket again and they don’t want the VIX over 40+ yet and they don’t want SPY back under 380 yet. 

My second theory is we are going to see a great CPI and a reassuring fed on Wednesday at FOMC. If that were to happen we could see the VIX unwind the rest of the way from 23 to 18 (just like the March rally and VIX unwind). 

In March we saw the VIX go from 34 on March 9th to 19 on March 29th which moved SPY from 415.12 to 462.07. 11.3%. If the VIX continues to unwind we could see the last 4% of the rally which would bring us up to 424 range. Oddly enough this tracks with one of my major daily resistance lines perfectly. 

https://preview.redd.it/pi5ibi6mbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a017899cb053a14705b8737d4ce1e24f92625a87

Do I think we see 424 at this point? No I really don’t. I really favor that we are going to get a CPI that’s comes in over expectations (currently consensus is 8.3%). 

Last CPI we saw them for the first time predict that inflation has essentially peaked saying we would see 8.1% instead of the previous 8.5%. We DID see a “peak” with a 0.2% decrease from 8.5% to 8.3%. They are now calling for that same number of 8.3%. Now if and when this CPI misses not only is it a miss of expectations its also confirming that inflation has NOT peaked which is a major deal. I predict we come in somewhere near 8.4-8.5%. 

In the off chance we DO see 8.2% or lower that would be a major catalyst for the markets though as it would confirm for 2 months in a row that inflation has “peaked.” Now of course in reality if we look at the world its bullshit there aint no way anythings peaked… But of course they look at the numbers how they want to… 

10% challenge-

Today was actually a GREAT day. I didn’t make my first trade till 1230 on that big drop. I stuck strictly 100% without wavering to my 5 of 5 in agreement momentum indicator and let me tell you she did not disappoint! It saved me from taking 3-4 trades that I would normally have entered. However, EOD when we were attempting to breakout during power hour it was showing 5 of 5 bullish. However, that’s where the overall trend of the day and relationship to the 8ema and comes into play hugely. IT was against trend so I couldn’t bring myself to enter the trade and im glad I didn’t as it obviously came back down… 

My only red trade today was an apple trade I attempted to enter in congruence with my SPY trade at 1230ish. It never saw about 3% and I closed when I closed my SPY put for profits. 

https://preview.redd.it/lv48qmvmbh491.png?width=755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6ad6871946a8fe5792d224bee1b9ee423b43d37

I decided to go ahead and enter some puts over night tonight. I think even if we open green that we will see at minimum 407 tomorrow intraday. However I favor us opening under the daily 8ema of 410.92 and braking down most of the day.

## Micro Symmetrical Triangle with Bullish Bias

* Lose 451.29 and the pattern is null
* Needs clear 452.96 to be viable.
* If we can’t clear 452.96 then the pattern shifts to double top. If we see a strong rejection, I’ll be looking for 450.66 as a downside target.
* Bullish 🎯 454.26 - 456.38
* I’ll be looking to trim 90% of positions at the 454 range and leave runners for the full measure (if it can get there)

## Uptrend Break to Downside

* Lose 451.87 - 451.50 and look for 450.17
* Lose 450.17 and look at the pivot at 448.37
* Bearish 🎯 447.17 - 444.09
* Finding support at 448.37 will put us in another rectangle. Thanks, Theta.

Notes:

* Neutral 440-449. Bullish 450+. Bearish at 439 and below. Want to see us close above 450 next week for a few days to be bullish.
* If we get near 448-450, I want to see if buyers come in - if they do, I believe we will finally get the full measure by the close. If they don’t, then I’ll look to 445-444.
* All else fails just trust the levels and measured moves, trimming or taking full profit at half measures and leaving runners for full measured moves.
* The 1-Day Netfow looks bearish so this does give me pause to increase positions at the open, especially if we have a substantial gap up open.
* Daily RSI - bullish. 65 min RSI - bullish - near overbought. 15 min. RSI - bullish near overbought.
* Bearish diversion on the 15 min. for what it’s worth.

As you can see, between 1997 and 2003, as the Armadillo (AMD) population count in Arkansas went down, Walmart (WMT) stock price went up with a logarithmic correlation around ~18ln(x).  This is because as we had more trucks running on the road, more armadillos were getting run over because they are slow.

In short, Arkansas' entire economy is inversely related to the Armadillo population.  So if we can just get our claws on some fresh Armadillo data it could be worth millions upon millions for all of us.

"SPY: Monday Jan 31 bull vs bear channelinteresting... just saw another channel forming on the 30 min... using the high from 1/26 and 1/28 and the lows from 1/25 and 1/28... 
now the question is will we choose the red dotted channel thats bullish or the white solid channel thats bearish. 🤔🤔. 
IF we open lower monday and do not trade higher at all pre market the white channel is definitely in play and like many of us are thinking monday will be a dip day... which gives us room to dip as low as 426 (thatd be 3.9% dip from fridays close... not impossible actually when you factor in we dipped 3.9% last monday 😬). 
if we are trading in the red dotted channel our highs near 447.5 (1.2% higher than close) and our lows near 428 (only 3.1% from the high). 
Monday is definitely going to be a very interesting day and a very telling day. depending on which way we move and how fast/ volatile we move we can invalidate one or both of these channels real quick. im pretty confident we will be choosing one this week though. 
looking at monday though... i see the 30 min rsi is 65 and the 1 hour rsi is 64 with both MACDs ready to signal sell... id be shocked if we opened much higher monday and didnt see at least a sell off down into the mid to high 430s. a 2% dip puts us at 433. 
kinda mad i gotta work tomorrow night and will be sleeping till power hour and miss all the action. hoping to jump in around 3pm on whatever up or down trend we are on to grab some quick gains though.
at the time of writing this futures turned green from red but are not really up all that much. cry*pto (which honestly i believe more than anything else when it comes to market direction) is very red and has been all day continuing to sell off. based on that i am willing to bet we see a dip tomorrow.

Notes:

* Remember, Mid to long-term bearish under 440. Bullish over 460. Neutral at 441-450.
* The bulls did gain a little steam IMO. SPY is looking stronger than QQQ. For tomorrow I’m somewhat neutral for the short-term. Really want to see this thing close above 430 tomorrow.
* Remember, we have a rate hike announcement tomorrow and JPOW is also talking. If a .75+ rate hike is announced then I believe the market will dump. If we see a .25 - .50 announced then that may be bullish IMO but we shall see. If Bulls can hold above the 425-422 range tomorrow then we may see 431-433. Be water.

"Help Me Understand NFLXHow can they have positive earnings but incredibly negative FCF?  It looks like their spending on content is completely independent of ""cost of goods sold"", essentially as investment rather than an ongoing expense.

My understanding of stocks is heavily rooted in automobiles and semiconductors.  There, R&amp;D is a huge expense, for semiconductors moreso than autos.  Intel, AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia all subtract their absolutely massive R&amp;D expenditures from their equally massive gross margins (AMD's margins were unsustainable bad at less than 40%, Intel is doing well at better than 50%), but their earnings are nowhere near that high because the EPS already has the R&amp;D subtracted out.

Semiconductor companies cannot survive on their back catalogs, and massive R&amp;D spending is an ongoing necessity.  While it is not a cost of sales line item, it comes out of revenue before earnings.  Similarly, NFLX cannot survive on its back catalog (i.e. binge watching Stranger Things 1-3...2027) at least not at anything like its present valuation.  That is even more true with competitors pulling third party content back onto their own, new streaming platforms while continuing to produce new, competitive content.

From that end, I would argue that while there may be some justification for how NFLX calculates EPS, the way that they do it excludes a massive line item that they cannot reduce without tanking revenue.  Therefore, by their accounting standards, EPS is virtually meaningless while FCF is the only metric that matters.

From that standpoint, NFLX seems less like a profitable company with international subscriber growth issues and domestic market saturation and more like a company that is literally hemorrhaging capital in a model that will never generate actual profits.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding this badly, but that's the best I could do.  Have at it, fellow autists.",0

"Stop buying AMD CallsHey guys,

A lot of you don't know me, as I don't usually post here. I'm usually over at /r/AMD_stock posting DD there. But I'm posting here because the recent activity in the stock led me to realize a huge, glaring problem with the stock's performance and it's latest earnings.

Let me step back a bit first.

Last Friday the stock plummeted 12% after posting the best earnings it possibly could have posted. At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down. The earnings were excellent, the margins were excellent, the guidance for 1Q21 was incredible, and the guidance for FY21 was almost double what the street was expecting. Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. 

What more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that? You could even see the [bewilderment](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/27/full-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-on-q4-results-product-pipeline-demand-and-more.html) on Lisa Su's face as she started an interview with CNBC the morning after.

Why? [No financial news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-q4-2020-advanced-micro-devices-earnings/), not even [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/amd-amd-earnings-q4-2020.html), could pin a 'reason' on the drop.

And then I realized the problem. It's you.

You buy the cheapest AMD weeklies you can and hold them through earnings like it can't go tits up. You hope that AMD beats all expectations, and that the stock price skyrockets on your tendie-train choo-choo-ing to the moon. Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!

The day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.

Stop losing at AMD! How? *INVEST PROPERLY*

How? Buy and hold shares or LEAPS. Stop chasing the mythical overnight gains. AMD is a *long-term success* and it has [room to double](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l6jijo/rosenblatt_securities_says_amd_could_double_in/). DO IT NOW - Price is recovering from the crush, but are still trading at a [20% discount to analyst consensus](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast), and at a 10% discount from it's recent highs.

Conclusion: This is a better buy-and-hold than GME, BB, or anything. AMD has grown continuously in the past 5 years and, if you read the DD on /r/AMD_stock, you'll discover that it also has an incredible growth roadmap the next 5 years.

Stop losing. Buy shares and double your money.

"8-23-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market AnalysisWell you were expecting a massive 2-3% sell off and thought we were about to see a dump like June then you unfortunately got severely disappointed. If you expected a gap fill today to 421 you also got disappointed. If you expected Spy to do anything but trade within the same about $1 range for 4 hours and 45 minutes you too were disappointed… 

https://preview.redd.it/wh9ay9kywij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b41f21171222dbc0faf44a20d71285503ad34433

I haven’t really see a day where the majority of price action was all within a tight range like that in a very long time. That was a frustratingly boring day to watch. 

https://preview.redd.it/zvgm4h5zwij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40af3217d6375453a83994854a4390a2b4939970

On the daily you can see we closed out today as a gravestone doji which I have touched on this many times before. A gravestone doji at the top (as in when price is running up) is usually a bearish reversal, however, when we are seeing a gravestone doji at the bottom of a trend (when price is dropping) then that usually is the signal of the bottom. Look at SPY 8-17, 8-9, 8-2 and Apple 8-9, 8-2, 7-26, and 6-17 for examples of what I mean. 

The most bearish thing that occurred today in my opinion is that we attempted to break through the daily 20ema at 414.9 and pretty much hit a brickwall. Once we hit that price and rejected we never saw it even attempted again. The only small bullish caveat here is that we did wick over the daily 20ema which could be seen as a hint of whats to come. 

Today price magnet all day was around 413 so of course that will be where we need to watch the most tomorrow. 

With the gap fill at 421.22 now 2.15% away from close it is harder to imagine that bulls fill that gap tomorrow, however, 2% days are not out of the norm and with the VIX closing just over 24 if that were to unwind back down to 20-21 that would be a big push for SPY green. 

Key resistance tomorrow-

415.2 (black resistance line) -&gt; 417.5 (daily resistance level and 200ema at 418) -&gt; 420.1

Key support tomorrow-

411.3 -&gt; 409.4 -&gt; 407.6 (support area for the July 29th to present bull run) 

Something to keep in mind that historically the SPY gaps do usually fill within 2 days… of course this doesn’t always happen but it does have a history of doing so… 

Overall I am still expecting that over the next two days we are going to push green and see that gap fill on the daily and weekly. Once that gap is filled I believe we will see Friday turn into a fairly red day as we are going to get JPOW talking at the Jackson Hole which he is going to once again say all the same hawkish things he has said for the last 2 months… expect this time markets are actually listening… 

https://preview.redd.it/6rn0matzwij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4c95afd3974fd0672eb9b847c12c82eb65ceb79

Futures is what I will keep my biggest eye on as we go forward tonight and tomorrow. 

We saw a nice hold of that key 4120 level. As long as bulls can defend 4120 I do see a case to retest that 4130 level. However, if we do lose (close daily below) 4120 then we most likely are going to be looking for 4000 here by next week. 

Key support-

4120 -&gt; 4100 -&gt; 4075 -&gt; 4040 (projected new red bull channel) 

Key resistance-

4120 (black resistance line) -&gt; 4158 -&gt; 4184 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 4210

Overall the black resistance line that has been showing this current 3 day down cycle is at 4120 tomorrow. In order for that line to hold and therefore trend we have to see ES close below 4120, open below 4120 and never break 4120 tonight or tomorrow. I do not personally for see that happening. 

https://preview.redd.it/d3vfsjh0xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d60c69a4b3cd172ff910fe5fa0f14916ba2aceb0

There really isn’t much to see on SPY weekly but on the futures weekly you can see we also bounced off of the weekly 8/ 20ema which is trending right at 4118. Overall if we were to see a close below that then that would be a very strong indication of downside to come. If those two EMAs hold as support that’s strong bullish case. 

https://preview.redd.it/uhr71421xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10eda127ba8e591cffca8b513ac440d51c7278cc

Under SPY I spoke about how a gravestone doji is usually a bullish reversal when we are in a down trend. I highlighted on Apple everytime we had a gravestone doji on Apple daily and you can see almost all of them were followed by a fairly green day. 

To be honest this Apple daily candle closed in no mans land. We are trading within that 166.4 to 167.5 area where due to the gaps and wicks there really hasn’t been much price action at all to gauge sentiment. 

We are nearing the first gap at 165.82 with only 0.9% to go until that gap would be filled tomorrow if we break down.

Overall mostly on Apple I am going to keep a close eye on 166.4. If we were to break down through that support then I would think that the upside for SPY and Apple is more limited this week and that we might either consolidate down here or just drill. 

https://preview.redd.it/x7anznu1xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79fd01b87493626b07d47a1224af96300c89e51c

Apple weekly shows that that 166.4 level is a very key support that we should keep and eye on too. 

Apple and Spy weekly still do have gaps on their charts. 

https://preview.redd.it/rwlhjv83xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=655a6ce205702bf3df406029fdbaff631b852ac8

The VIX is very interesting here to say the least. So after trading so long down at that 20 level we have now spent two days trading up here around 24. 

We do have the GAP on the VIX which I did mention in my video we have not had one since the June sell off and whenever we do have a VIX gap we don’t usually see it left for more then 2 or 3 days. 

VIX also is still rejecting breaking out of this 24.2 level. This is where we continue to keep our eyes on tomorrow. If we break out over 24.2 tomorrow and see 25 then the sell off is likely to come. If we see VIX settle down and we see it start pushing down to 22-23 like it tried to intraday today the gap fill is coming. 

This is one of those times where the VIX actually would be helpful to watch. 

10% challenge-

Despite the pretty much terrible chart we had on SPY to trade today I had a good day. 

https://preview.redd.it/lhvx7ov3xij91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47419fbdc82a8d1f954db7610988dc9b5a78798f

I took 2 calls for a 10% profit. 

I am not sure about you guys but TOS has been really screwing me over lately when it comes to fills and orders… So yesterday you guys know my limit sell skipped over and now today. I opened that put at 9.5 and price hit 10.2 (so I was up 8%) I set a 2% trailing stop limit (purposefully set it at 2% to limit slip) well it triggered of course at 10 premium… however, TOS didn’t fill me till 9.4. Of course im pissed off and contact them why I have nearly $1 of slippage on a contract like that when I was green and all they could tell me was that “that’s just how market orders work… perhaps you should try a limit order never time.”   
   
 

To be honest I have been pretty much over TOS/ TDA crap lately and its only getting worse. They truly don’t care about their customers anymore… but that’s a discussion for another time. 

Overall a good day despite the fill issue. Looking forward to a possibly better trend or at least wider range day to get some better trades tomorrow too. 

See you guys tomorrow! Youtube will be up later.",1

#**Introduction**

What’s poppin’ fellas? Ape gang professor Flux here with another heater post. You may know me from my AT&amp;T DD post which taught you how to follow unusual options flow to make some coin, or from my Hut 8 DD post which taught you how to make money using financial arbitrage. 

&amp;nbsp;

Today, we’re going to be learning how to identify optimal entry and exit prices for our trades, by analyzing simple charts and spotting trends. This will be done using the chart for my favourite ticker, AMD. **To all you illiterate, paint-huffing apes who dropped outta highschool and don’t like learning, I’ve attached a TLDR at the end of the post which tells you which contracts to buy to get some free money**. Let’s get to it!

&amp;nbsp;

---

#**Building The Foundation**
To begin, let’s take a look at the [AMD one day chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/X5hkIw6s/), and see if we notice anything odd, or unusual.

Do you see anything in particular? Does anything jump out at you? No? [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1DzmPafE/)

Still nothing? If you still don't notice anything, that’s fine, these patterns can be difficult to spot initially. [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uHY32HCB/)

As you can see from the final chart, for the past year, AMD has traded within very tight, specific ranges. I have highlighted these areas on the chart using the pink boxes. As we can tell; 

&amp;nbsp;

- **Box #1)** Starting from mid February to mid April, AMD traded within a 10$ range, between $39 and $49. It started at 49$, went down to 39$, back up to 49$, down to 40$, before once again going back up to 49$, where it then smashed through the top of our current trading range, creating a new range.
- **Box #2)** Now, starting from mid April, going all the way until earnings in August, AMD traded within a 10$ range **again**, between $49 and $59. This range was extremely tight and pronounced, bouncing from the bottom of the channel up to the top of the channel **seven** times throughout its lifetime, before smashing through the top of the channel again.
- **Box #3)** August through December. $74 to 87$ channel. This range was slightly messier, but still pronounced nonetheless. 6 clean bounces. Smash through the top into our new range.
- **Box #4)** This is where our most recent range lies, with an $85 bottom and a 95$ top. We haven’t surged out of this range in either direction, so it is safe to assume we are still trading within this range. **How can we use this information to our advantage?**

&amp;nbsp;

---

#**Applying our Knowledge**

To summarize our findings from above, for the past year, AMD has consistently traded within a predefined range before surging higher and entering a newer, higher range. These ranges have held and contained **27 different bounces without breaking**. Only one single trade has bounced lower than a given range, but it recovered within hours. **Twenty seven times, this thesis has held true, so why the fuck would it be different on the 28th**?

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, I assume most of you glue sniffers know how we can use this information to our advantage. We know that AMD trades within a tight range. We know that we are currently within the $85-$95 range. We coincidentally also happen to be sitting right at 85$. As a result, we know that it is **extremely** likely that a bounce off of $85 is going to take place.

&amp;nbsp;

Since we know that $85 is likely a bottom, and a bounce is likely going to take place, we can enter a monthly position here and make some awesome money. Personally, I picked up some 03/19 90Cs, as well as some 04/16 95Cs. And just like that, we managed to catch the literal bottom of a trade, and have the opportunity to make some free money. We can also use our findings to know when to exit our trade.

&amp;nbsp;

---

#**Extending our Knowledge**

Since we know we are trading in a channel, we also know roughly when we can expect to exit our trades! We know that the closer we get to $95, the more likely it is that we will bounce, so we can plan accordingly! Personally, with my 90C, I will look to set a stop loss when AMD is trading around 90$, and manually sell out of the position if AMD manages to break $92/$93.

&amp;nbsp;

Even though I’m a perma bull, I also trade the flipside of the channel as well. If I see AMD trading at $95+, I’ll enter a short position and play the trade on the way down. In this case, I set my stops a little tighter, and keep a greater watch over the trade, since we all know that stocks always go up. Furthermore, since every single channel ended with a blow off top, I don’t want to get caught in a random blowout and have my options expire worthless. I would rather be conscientious beforehand, and manage my risks accordingly.

&amp;nbsp;

---

#**Conclusion**

As you can tell, we can learn a lot about the price movement of a stock by simply looking at its chart. Although the AMD example was painfully simple, it’s also painfully effective. The best part about all this is, that there are dozens of opportunities like this within the market, simply waiting to be discovered. I hope you all learned something new today, and had fun while doing so. If you guys want to check out my other DDs, or follow me on my socials, they can all be found on my profile (Discord saw this DD first!). I love you all, and wish lots tendies upon each and every one of you :)

## Micro Symmetrical Triangle with Bullish Bias

* Lose 451.29 and the pattern is null
* Needs clear 452.96 to be viable.
* If we can’t clear 452.96 then the pattern shifts to double top. If we see a strong rejection, I’ll be looking for 450.66 as a downside target.
* Bullish 🎯 454.26 - 456.38
* I’ll be looking to trim 90% of positions at the 454 range and leave runners for the full measure (if it can get there)

https://preview.redd.it/7c4wbfzfnsp81.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9c1cff048594697ca9ef17749dd71e749001223

## Uptrend Break to Downside

* Lose 451.87 - 451.50 and look for 450.17
* Lose 450.17 and look at the pivot at 448.37
* Bearish 🎯 447.17 - 444.09
* Finding support at 448.37 will put us in another rectangle. Thanks, Theta.

Notes:

* Neutral 440-449. Bullish 450+. Bearish at 439 and below. Want to see us close above 450 next week for a few days to be bullish.
* If we get near 448-450, I want to see if buyers come in - if they do, I believe we will finally get the full measure by the close. If they don’t, then I’ll look to 445-444.
* All else fails just trust the levels and measured moves, trimming or taking full profit at half measures and leaving runners for full measured moves.
* The 1-Day Netfow looks bearish so this does give me pause to increase positions at the open, especially if we have a substantial gap up open.
* Daily RSI - bullish. 65 min RSI - bullish - near overbought. 15 min. RSI - bullish near overbought.
* Bearish diversion on the 15 min. for what it’s worth.

* Bearish diversion on 65 min MACD still playing out. Needs to clear 2.16 to be null.

"If you had a bad week take my debit spread on aapl your guaranteed to profitOkay so I'm not sure how your week went guy but here is a really safe play both the prices strike prices are itm underneath support 

So the play it's a weekly personally I don't really like playing these but this one is looking very promising I used the bid and ask price for both of these so you should get instantly filled probably can squeeze out a little more profit if your willing to wait to get filled.

So the play

Buy a aapl 9/21 call strike price is 215$ you should be expecting to pay around 9.35$ to get instantly filled 

Sell a aapl 9/21 call strike price is 217.50 ( support is 218$) to instantly sell it'll have to be at 7.00

Now you maximum net debit of 235$ this is the most you can lose 

If aapl is above 217.51 you'll make a whole 15$ 
If aapl is below 217.50 youll lose all your debit 235$ 

Now here is the beautiful part is aapl is above 220.50$ you make your maximum return of 265$ 

Because your 215$ will be worth 5.50$ at 200.50 
And the one you sold short (217.50)  will be a -50$ to you 550-50= 500 now take that 500$ and take away your debit of $235 and your return is 265 enjoy :)

On days when the market drops red on stocks 3-5 % it always seems to bottom out by noon and then recover at least half even if it is down for the day. Today I decided to jump in and bought 8/16 SPY ETF Calls around noon. Initially I had planned to sell at around 3pm the same day indefinitely. I went for a swim and when I logged into to my phone (10 minutes later) my calls were up 15 %, so I sold. This is the quickest I have ever made that kind of return. Yes I probably would have made 60% if I held longer but money is money. Rinse and repeat? I think so.

"3/11/22 Pre-Market SPYSome of my least favorite days are waking up and seeing someone sort of either massive spike up or massive dump down pre-market like this. Its always hard to know whats real and whats fake from there. It makes our job today that much harder. Thankfully we have some trend lines we can watch. 

Apparently the only new people are hearing is that made the market skyrocket was some good news from putin about Russia/ Ukraine, removing Russia as favorable trade status, and possible spending bill? Overall we do have some consumer data coming out at 10am we need to watch and IF this is really propped up by Russia we need to be very very careful. Also need to keep in mind according to CNBC the feds QE is apparently over as of yesterday. 

https://preview.redd.it/fe7xwhyxdrm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b346be77cdb373a7e5984d6ec2676cc733649b2d

The one thing I am seeing is a nice upward channel (short term) that we are trading within since March 7th. This is an important channel to keep an eye on. 

Upper resistance of that channel is 434 and lower support is 424. We also have an important support line that SPY was following PRIOR to the 615am spike. I find this support line to be the most important to watch today for whether we are going to continue upwards or not. That support will be around 428 at market open. We also are trading ABOVE the daily 8 ema now which is a very important shortterm bullish sentiment the 8ema sit at 427.2 and will be a key support for bulls to close above. I have a big resistance line near that 434 mark I mentioned earlier too for the daily chart that we will watch. Overall 440 is the max resistance line that if broken could signal bull markets back on. 

A couple other things to watch is VIX is currently below 30 at 29.42. If we see the VIX start to climb back up at all that’s gonna be a sign we are headed lower again. 

OIL is down to $105/barrel again so that will be important to watch too. 

&amp;#x200B;

KEY supports today- 

429.5  428.7 428.8  428  427.5  426.9  426.4  425.6  424. 8  423.5 

\-0.5%= 423.4

\-1%=421.2

\-1.5%=319

\-2%= 417

&amp;#x200B;

Key Resistance today

430.6  431.2  431.9  433.2  434.2 (upper limit of the channel) 

0.5%= 427.6

1%= 429.7

1.5%= 431.8

2%= 434

&amp;#x200B;

Remember do not go into today biased of what way we are going to go. We can very well see a massive sell off and we very well could see a massive pump above 434. This market is still very clearly sensitive to news and that may play out today.",0

"How to trade AMZN for less than the price of one shareNoticed a bunch of noob questions about options. Thought I would outline an example of a credit spread in the form of a bull put, for any of you that have mastered the FD and are looking to expand your playbook. 

Some benefits of the bull put spread: Your risk is defined and you will know going into the trade how much you can make or lose. Also, when putting on a credit spread, the credit goes into your account right away. This will be your max gain and your goal is to keep all or most of it. 

Why a bull put spread: Choose a stock that you are bullish on. Rather than being an option buyer, you are selling the expensive put option (the short leg) and buying the further out and cheaper put as a hedge (the long leg, without this it’s a naked put and your risk is unlimited).  

[Here is a credit spread on AMZN that I opened on May 8th.](https://imgur.com/a/LKdeiQi) I sold the May 18th 1600 put for $2,758 and bought the 1590 put for $2,279 as protection. I received the difference, or $478 as a credit to my account. 

Analyze and manage your position. If AMZN closes above 1600 this Friday, I will keep the entire credit. If AMZN is at $1595, I break even. If Amazon drops, the most I can lose is $522 (the difference of the spread 1600-1590 times 100 minus credit of 478). [Here is the P&amp;L chart for the position. ](https://imgur.com/a/1v2yVwG) Notice that theta is now your friend, as long as AMZN stays above 1600. 

And that’s how you can use options to trade Amazon and only risk a few hundred bucks. If this helps anyone, I can share some other trades and strategies. ",0

"9-9-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Weekly recap and AnalysisThe bulls are back in control… or are they? 

Lets take a look at a few things before we get into the charts and the technical. 

If you follow me you know that I came into this week bearish and I was positioned with some 390p 14dte puts expecting a touch of 370-380. Now the question is why was a bearish? 

Well going into this week we had the attempted breakout at 430 that led to a massive sell off that led to 3 red weeks with us finally turning in a green week on SPY this week. On a technical standpoint puts made sense and calls would have been against the trend… in addition we had the CPI looming. Going into this week and going into Thursday we had no forecast and we had no consensus on CPI. With literally every single fed member, JPOW himself and heck even Biden saying “inflation has not peaked” with the massive sell off, the suspiciously long time we went with no CPI forecast/ consensus one would assume it was because they were going to predict inflation &gt;8.5% (higher then previous). However, Thursday the forecast came in at 8.1% and today the consensus also came in at 8.1%. 

Now that we have seen CPI come in bullish, markets have accepted the fact that we most likely will be seeing a 75bps hike no matter what CPI is and markets clearly rallying despite everything JPOW re-iterated Thursday morning… and now looking at the technical with a massive V bottom rally off 390 (after consolidation) and a break through of the 405.2 level… its pretty hard to not be bullish going into next week.

After 405.2 broke intraday today and we held it I took a loss on my then 12dte puts I have no reason to expect a reason for us to go down. Now the only reason I remotely could expect any sort of bigger sell off to break 405.2 next week would be IF CPI comes in dogwater like 9%. If CPI comes in at 8.5% or below markets are about to shrek back to 430 if not higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4kv3ovp6xwm91.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3847b0ea297345adb8599983c311c6080d9f1b

Looking at SPY daily you can see we have a very sharp and distinct V bottom using September 1st and September 7th to start the V. We have now held that support for 3 days in a row. I spoke on the fact that in the last 16 days there had only been two times that SPY had back to back green days well this is the first time since the peak at 430 that spy has put in back to back to back green days. This in my opinion is the change of tide. The bear sentiment has left the market. 

We broke through that blue resistance line. This is the line using August 16th and August 26th tops. Breaking this line is saying the bear movement is over and we should be looking for the next bull run. In addition, a close back over that level resistance of 405.2 is extremely bullish especially after a failure to continue lower after breaking 390. While we could see a return back to 390 (but unlikely in current bullish sentiment and news cycle) a closure over 405.2 should lead markets to push back for a 417.3 level test. 

Bulls managed to close this daily candle completely over the daily 8ema. Until that daily 8eam is broken we should be bullish. 

Now today did leave a \~$2 gap on the daily chart that COULD be filled before we push higher. I do forsee a scenario Monday where we back fill that gap and see a little weakness going into CPI. Actually a red day Monday would give way for four green days in a row after CPI comes in positive. 

Key supports- 405.2 (level support) -&gt; 402.7 -&gt; 401.8 (V bottom recovery support) -&gt; 400.4 (gap fill at 400.86) -&gt; 397.8 

Key resistance- 409.6 -&gt; 412 -&gt; 415.3 -&gt; 417.4 (level resistance) 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at SPY weekly we are have broken out of that downward channel on the weekly too. Now the one interesting thing is that SPY weekly did break through the blue June/ July recovery support line (futures and Apple also did), however, despite that being a bearish signal we rallied off of that level. 

I called it out earlier in the week but we are seeing a double bottom like formation at 392.2 also on the weekly and closed higher then last weeks candle which should signal upside. With a weekly close back over the daily 8ema and 100ema as long as spy holds the daily and weekly 8emas we should be bullish. 

Key support- 390.3

Key resistance- 412.5 -&gt; 426.1

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/amrjf5x7xwm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa7527fb19b7fbfd22fc44dc2de49d0b11408349

Futures has a similar V shaped recovery also, however, it did not break through its bear run blue resistance line as that was at 4105. While futures did close back over the daily 8ema it did fail to close over the 100ema. 

Key support- 4060 (v bottom support) -&gt; 4025 -&gt; 4008 -&gt; 3980

Key resistance- 4092 (blue resistance) -&gt; 4128 -&gt; 4148 -&gt; 4200

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/31lra5i8xwm91.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52f32bfa150d8713c893f39713f5cb61fc376bab

Futures weekly did break through that blue support line as I mentioned in SPY, but with this new bounce we will make the new support recovery line. We saw the weekly also break the black bear channel too along with closing back over the 8ema and 100ema. With a level close over 4025 we will next look for 4160 and 4280.

Key support- 4025 -&gt; 3900 (blue bull support)

Key resistance- 4160 -&gt; 4280

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/40erpo09xwm91.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11cf85d6f6dab4325067dce3bb701ce7283e5aa5

I had mentioned that pretty much all week and even some of last week that Apple was looking extremely weak compared to SPY. We did not see that v bottom recovery that futures and SPY were showing form until today. With two intraweek closed below the daily 200ema that would appear to be very bearish, however, we actually saw Apple put in quite a bit of strength today. 

Apple failed to close over its daily 8ema but we can look for that to take place next week along with pushing for that blue bear resistance from this sell off. 

Key support- 156.7 (v bottom support) -&gt; 155.5 (200ema) -&gt; 154.4

Key resistance- 158 -&gt; 160.3

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f35jp1j9xwm91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1e2b74f697ccb2e88564a611cebe0a1b248160d

Now Apples weekly is where things get a little peculiar when you factor in Apples daily and SPY/ the general market and sentiment shift. 

The apple chart is still holding within the downward channel from the August 15th and August 22nd weekly tops. But unless Apple opens under 156.7 and holds there the remained of the week Monday will most likely open over that level. However, we are seeing a gravestone doji weekly candle closed (the opposite of what we saw the week of August 15th) and this should signal a push green next week. 

Key support- 154.7 (blue bull support) -&gt; 154 -&gt; 150.3

Key resistance- 156.7 (bear resistance) -&gt; 161.1 -&gt; 163.5

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s4maeh3axwm91.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f35581154b61494d684630ebd463a800c0d84e

As I mentioned on Thursday the VIX had broken the recovery support line and has closed its 3rd consecutive candle below 25.5 With this failure to breakout to 30 and looming bullish (aka lessened fear) of CPI and FOMC coming up we should expect to see the VIX retest the 18s and 19s soon. 

Where am I at now? 

Overall going into next week I suspect Monday to be a red day or at a minimum a consolidation day with most like a 0.5 +/- finish. While the markets do expect CPI to be bullish I would be hesitant for the markets to close a 4th green day in a row and then have that proceeded by a good CPI and see 5 green days in a row. Crazier things have happened but after 3 pretty big green days (when you think about the last month of sell off) it would not be surprising to see small decline on Monday. A retest of 405.2 and possibly even a gap fill back to 400 could be in play. 

From there I do expect now that the forecast and consensus along with the Cleveland Fed CPI all coming in below previous CPI of 8.5% that we will get a “good” CPI reading (good as in reading less than previous CPI of 8.5%). I believe this will start a rally into FOMC (the next Wednesday the 21st). From there markets will get their expected 75bps hike (remember markets don’t like the unexpected so even if bearish… if its known they handle it well) and from there we see a rally through end of September into October which takes us into the next earning season. 

To be honest with CPI expected (and again assuming its good) coming down, the expected 75bps hike and really no new bearish catalysts to be had (unless someone can tell me something im missing here…) once CPI drops on Tuesday… there will be really little reason to not be playing calls into middle of October when we see the next earnings start. These earnings could be the only thing in my opinion that would take the market down but even there I don’t expect any more massive sell offs unless a new catalyst happens. 

My plan-

Overnight calls (small position) 3-5 strikes OTM (going to do some research this weekend on what will be the best play) Monday night into Tuesday morning (for the CPI good reading play). 

I will let Tuesday of CPI shake itself out… there is a chance core CPI could come in high and we could see a sell off on that but would be unlikely as long as the actual CPI is decreasing (below 8.5%).

From there either Tuesday night (risk on) or Wednesday night (more conservative) I would consider opening some 30-45dte calls on SPY (and possibly Apple). 

If you are aggressive you could open calls on Monday and let those ride also. However, you risk here being wrong about CPI and having CPI cause a major break down. 

Note- I will have my FOMC post up next weekend with a trade analysis and trade plan

10% challenge-

Overall this was a GREAT week for me… honestly one of the better weeks I have had in a very long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wvghhzyaxwm91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be119a69e9517edf2668a9b6618d339f8284e9f7

So what did I change this week? I spoke on this a little in my last weeks TA but I went from about $1500-$2000/ entry down to about $700-$1000/ entry. I also over the last few weeks have found myself hesitating on entries. Essentially I would be watching my indicators and see the “perfect” setup forming and I would see what would be a great entry forming, however, I would say well don’t be early…. Be patient… and what I would end up doing is waiting for extra extra confirmation that the trend move I saw was actually happening. This would net me a great entry but I found I was missing such a large % gains because of this. Moves that shoulda easily been resulting in 15-25% gains were being capped at 3-5% gains because by time I was ready to enter the premiums had already priced the move in and the acceleration of the move was already done. This also resulted in many times that if I didn’t immediately enter I would end up red. 

With a little big more aggressiveness… really pro-activeness on entries and recognizing its okay to be wrong as long as I keep a stop loss in place (definitely stuck to my -20% stop loss all week without waver) then I found myself with a much higher win rate and a much higher pay out on the wins I did bring in. This week was a really good mental week for me (and financial week). I look forward to carrying this success and strength into the rest of the month and year. 

Another thing I recognized this week and was able to adapt to was the trend. While I was holding 14dte puts most of the week I did not find myself staying biased the last 3 days. I was able to play the intraday trend while having an overall bearish trend in mind. 

The one thing I could have done differently this week when I look at my 14dte puts I opened after 390 broke and after we closed below 390 was to wait for extra confirmation. I could have waited one more day (which would have definitely resulted in not entering the same puts) and saw that we closed back over 390. A little bit of patience here could have resulted in not even opening that position and that also could have allowed me to more clearly see the support that and strength that 390 was putting in. I did begin middle of the week to recognized the consolidation that was taking place between 401.4 and 390, however, I would have liked to recognize that earlier. The one thing I will say though is that when Apple is known and has been historically driving the markets… when apple is continuing to push lower and look heavily bearish despite SPYs movements, its not that out of line to expect SPY to catch up to Apples momentum. However, we saw this week that the general market (non-tech) was driving this rally. 

If you look at my intraday log I did open some 30dte calls on SPY and Apple near EOD today but I did decide to close them before EOD. I was going to be pro-active and let these run after the great CPI forecast and everything but I decided that with 3 green days in a row we should expect a consolidation day and possibly even a bigger red day to fill that gap before CPI starts a potential bull run. After being too aggressive with the put swings im okay with being conservative here… and if I am correct waiting 2 more days to enter calls is not going to make a big difference. The magnitude of this next potential “bear market rally” could take us up near 440-450s by middle to end of October…

"8-19-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Weekly Market Analysis and RecapIf you read yesterdays TA you know where my head was at and where my head is going for the next leg… (read below is not).

https://preview.redd.it/uj75f4x3jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=949426ca834e95c60bfcd35d9645e17fc0e1b93a

Lets take a look at where we are. SPY- 422.14 (hit), Apple 171.52 (hit) and VIX 20.59 (hit). So all three conditions to make me consider the top was in hit today… however I did not go long on puts yet today and here is why. 

https://preview.redd.it/jmw5knf4jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d251511037330a044881177d14b0b2b3f9dcd498

If you are to put todays (on the left above) and yesterdays (on the right above) 15min intraday trading charts right next to eachother what do you see? You see consolidation. Today we opened pretty deep red and had a nice 30 minute sell off but after that the bulls were just as much in the game as the bears were. This was not some sort of capitulation, top is in, send this to the 360s tomorrow day. This felt almost like a “slip” by the bulls. I did not see the crazy sell pressures and the crazy straight down trend day all day like I was looking for despite hitting all my price targets. The thing that happened was we had a big red pre market that helped us get to those price targets. The actually intraday trading today was essentially just another range day. 

I want to have the weekend for the markets and everyone else to maul over whether the next leg down is beginning or not. There are still a few more things I would like to see first. 

https://preview.redd.it/3n150my4jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a510737b95b36b7b1cb0c3ceb9b49b51dc806da

On SPY daily chart you can see that we finally broke the 9 week long bull support. And this wasn’t just a small retracement through it like back on August 9th this was a clear break through it. 

Bear case- We saw the red 9 week long support line broke, the daily 8ema was broken and closed beneath, we failed to resttest the bear market resistance after hitting it, we had 104% of the 30day average volume today (this means that there was a lot of activity as in sellers greatly outweighed buyers… not just that no one was buying). This is the reddest close SPY has had since June 28th which did lead to a small sell off. 

Bull case- Despite breaking support we still managed to hold 422 as support. SPY has now spent 6 trading days between the 422 and 430 levels. This could be just consolidation with the final rest before we push to the next level up. Despite opening red and immediately selling off the bulls did not let this turn into a massively red day and also prevented the VIX from escalating too much. Despite today being the reddest close for SPY since June 28th which did lead to a 3 day sell off that actually then led to the current rally we are in. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rfi2ukm5jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca338b125c35906ea821d1677b77b0b1636a7723

The SPY weekly finished about how I expected with that nice gravestone doji. The candle body also closed below the previous weeks candle. I do believe looking at the weekly candle that we are at the top. However, one thing to note about the December and March tops is that despite similar candles the Friday close and Monday opening price were +0.3% in December and +0.2% in March. So that means we have most likely will open green Monday and we shouldn’t really expect a -2% gap down Monday (this is also why I was okay waiting to open a position). 

The weekly is still holding its 9 week long bull support… the daily breaking its bull support though should mean that Monday we break through our support. 

I will be looking for Monday to open below the 428.4 support level. There is very little chance we gap up $6 Monday and hold that all week. 

Key major supports for SPY next week-

417.5 (daily 200ema and level support) -&gt; 414.5 (daily 20 ema) -&gt; 412.75 (gap fill)  -&gt; 410 (daily 100ema) -&gt; 405.4 (daily level support and daily 50ema) 

Key major resistance for SPY next week-

424.6 (black downward line) -&gt; 429.7 (daily level resistance) -&gt; 431 (weekly bear market resistance line) 

Overall when you look at Spy its clear to me that the top is in. There is a slight case to be made that this is consolidation and that we chop here for a week before our next leg down. However, look at the way the market has “turned” and overall sentiment has turned in the market I wouldn’t be surprised to see a flat to red day Monday followed by the leg down. Monday I will most likely go into my puts EOD as long as its not a massively big green day. 

If we happen to get a big green day Monday or come out hella bullish then I would wait until we retest 429.7/ 431 to see if they retest and break through bear market resistance or not. There is a case to be made still for 460 before the next CPI in September.

Futures daily also broke is red 9 week long bull support finally and still has not touched actual bear market resistance yet. 

Key supports-

4188 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 4120 (daily 100ema) -&gt; 4073 (daily 50ema) 

Key resistance-

4278 -&gt; 4310 (bear market resistance)

Futures weekly closed out almost identical to spy. We are seeing closer to a true double top here though. Overall I will be looking to see the weekly bear market support of 4275 broken Sunday night at open and from there we should see the start of the sell off. Like SPY though there is always a chance we could see a final green push that touches the actual weekly bear market resistance at 4325 (which would also make a perfect double top) before we see the leg down. Being that SPY touched resistance and ES did not I do have that thought in the back of my head. 

https://preview.redd.it/uz7j8qn7jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe10607d46561a53a39efd4ef006eddd185d92fa

Apple is honestly the main reason I did not go long on puts yet. I see we hit my price target of 172.3 which is great and all but I really wanted to see a bigger sell off. On Apple it bounced off the daily 8ema and did not close below it. This is the reddest day for Apple though since July 18th. 

A few things that have me hestitating that the actual top is in is that on Apple we broke the 3 week long black bull support line but we have still not even touched the 9 week long red bull support since July 26th. I would like to see this tested and broken officially. This also was not that red of a day in terms of Apple compared to the green days we have seen Apple having. This really seemed more like a rest day then a true drill day. 

Key levels to watch on apple

Support-

169.9 (red bull support on Monday) -&gt; 167.6 -&gt; 164.9 (gap fill) 

Resistance- 

173 -&gt; 174.5 (bear market resistance)

If I can see Apple on Monday especially break through that red bull support I would consider some 14-30dte puts to ride down to the 164.9 gap fill. I think that would be a very high probability play. There is another gap down at 157.5 but we could see the gap fill, consolidation and then either move back up or down. So I would hesitate a longer dte here and wouldn’t hold it pass the gap fill.

Alright so the VIX final is doing something right? Well yes and no. So we finally broke this massive falling wedge. So that means bottom of VIX is in and we are going to rocket to 40 right? Well no not really honestly. Despite that we still closed within this 19.5 to 20.5 range. It was a good start for sure. But I like I have said many times before would really like to see VIX close to 22 and put more than one green day in to really sell it. 

10% challenge-

As you guys who follow me or are in the server I really struggled the last month. My main struggle came from failure to mitigate my losses. I would feel so confident in my plays that I would marry them and by time I finally realized how toxic the relationship was for me… they would take everything I have. I finally last week said enough is enough and I have started doing a 20% trailing stop order that is opened with any play I open. I mitigated my losses very well this week. And I was able to lock in a green week this week. It was not some amazingly green week where you put it on your fridge… but it was a really good step forward for me. 

https://preview.redd.it/29zog4y8jri91.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a6d85e441c10cd3b5d3a7ae84f7b01a88ad9ac7

Overall I locked in a green week. Again nothing to get too excited about. While its not an excuse but due to a crummy last few weeks I did use about ½ my normal position size Monday through Wednesday which did mean when Thursday came and I finally felt “confident” and took two losses and a loss today that I erased a lot of gains. However, again still a good week. 

It’s a good step forward in being mechanical in taking profits and locking in gains. 

I did have a few issues this week with LIMIT orders that I missed probs 5-7 solid plays this week because I could not get filled on a limit order and by time I was ready to be filled the play had moved 10-20% already and then I was chasing. I am going to evaluate going back to market orders for opening like I used to. I did have one case also of a limit sell not being filled but overall my sells have been fine besides one play that missed. 

I look forward to this being one big step back in the right direction. 

I hope you guys have a great weekend and I will see you guys on Monday !

1. Broker?

- Tastyworks. Free permissions to do naked options as long as you have initial margin requirements.

2. Margin requirements to sell naked options?

- I think it depends on broker, underlying stock, strike, date, IV, and other stuff. July 19 $195/275 short strangle for $10.53 credit is showing $2.2k buying power reduction for me. Meanwhile a short straddle at $230 for $36.38 credit is showing $4.6k BPR. 

3. Your current/next moves?

- Currently selling some uncovered AMZN options. https://i.imgur.com/PztIVlz.png. Not the best margin reduction to profit ratio, but it's a fun play. Will start selling TSLA in the future when next earnings comes up. For the time being, I consider selling puts under $220 as ""safe"" and calls over $255 as ""safe."" Anything can change.

"AMZN: A Case Study on How a Tech Megacap Stalwart Falls From GraceSo I had time enough this past weekend to really analyze AMZN's most recent earnings and read between the lines.  What I found actually bodes well in terms of giving a leg up for smaller companies against all the macro headwinds, so bulls your poor bussys can have a rest.

Weirdly enough, some charting and TA served as a reliable second opinion in which to base off the what the fundamentals of the company are screaming laid out in the earnings report.

Hear me out and listen closely you fucking single digit IQ twatwaffles.  Maybe you'll actually come out in the green for once in your pathetic mom's basement dwelling life.  Pull up last weeks chart with the 8 EMA, 21 EMA, and 50 SMA overlaid with daily candles along with Bollingers and Heiken Ashis as reference so you can follow along.  It'll help to all make perfect sense in a bit and you'll totally get why a megacap stalwart can lose greater than $100B+ market cap in a single day, and it has nothing to do with inflation or Daddy Jpow ""Traitor to Fuk Yo Puts"" impending rate hikes of doom.

Now.

*&lt;clears throat&gt;*

I’m not sure how up to date you are on the whole GameStop situation but Amazon is heading for bankruptcy and GameStop is now their biggest competitor.

Market cap isn’t there yet, but the company plan is on track.

Also Jeff Bezos is the target of every major corporation now.

Amazon CANT survive the next few years with their increasing bad reputation from littering and burning unused inventory to labor rights with their workers being violated.

Amazon sounds great, until you look underneath the hood and see all the parts are grinding and screaming.

GameStop is targeting Amazon to be the epicenter of e-commerce/gaming.

This GameStop earnings has been MASSIVELY anticipated and I believe Amazon will continue to develop a negative correlation to GameStop.

So what do they have to do with each other? Competitors and GameStops about to make the move with a bite to the jugular.",1

"My Plan for Intergenerational Wealth : UVIX ---&gt; SVXY ---&gt; SPY ---&gt; Real EstateTLDR; Buy leveraged volatility products....MARKET CAPITULATION...Vix spikes before S&amp;P bottom.... hold gains in SVXY to make more money while waiting for S&amp;P bottom... Buy S&amp;P bottom and hold....shop for houses in gaped housing market....take back our property from the big banks

&amp;#x200B;

As inflation continues to compound and fuck us day after day, it can be easy to get beat down in the dumps. If you're like me, you are getting paid nothing at a job that you are gonna lose by the end of July, yet you still dump all of your measly pay stubs directly into the market like the degenerate gambler you are.  Some may call it irresponsible, I call it making lemonade out of the most bitter of lemons. 

**The lemons:**

We all know a recession is coming. We all know inflation will not stop with these pathetic 75 bp hikes. We all know that the housing market will crash. We all know that the stock market will crash. The fun and games from 2021 are over. Historically, retail traders get absolutely fucked under these conditions, and at the end of the boom bust cycle, the rich get richer as they extract wealth from the retail bagholders. This will happen no more. While yes, food and gas are beginning to become unaffordable and it seems like the end is near, I like to stay glass half full. **I aim to turn this ""once in a lifetime"" market turmoil into an event of massive wealth creation, and you should too.**  My plan has 4 main phases which I will list below.

***THE LEMONADE:***

**Phase 1: Accumulation (UVIX)--** Currently, I am in phase one of my plan: **buying as many shares of leveraged volatility products as possible.** Since Jan 2022 we have seen much market volatility. Although the market has sold off 20%, there has not been a large move on the VIX. This is not concerning to me. It seems to be indictive of organized selling and exiting from institutions. This has given me time to buy UVIX and UVIXY on the dips as they oscillate during the sell off. Looking at 2008 this same set up can be seen. VIX did not move much at all as the S&amp;P sold off 20%. It was not until the capitulation when VIX spiked. When will capitulation occur? I'm not sure, but I am damn sure that I will have all the capital I can spare in volatility products when the day comes. I will begin to sell when VIX cracks 50, but my price target is 60+ or possibly 70s.

**Phase 2: Bridging the Gap (SVXY)--** So VIX pops off, now what? Well if you look at the graph below, VIX spikes 4 whole months before the S&amp;P bottoms. So the question is, what do I do with all my gains from the volatility squeeze? I can't just have them sitting around uninvested. Answer: SVXY. SVXY is a leveraged inverse VIX etf. As VIX drops from the 60s to the 30s I can make an over 50% return by buying and holding SVXY until the market finally bottoms. This will allow me to make money while I wait to buy the REAL dip 

[Capitulation in 2008, VIX did not spike until well after an S&amp;P bear market.](https://preview.redd.it/7ivzxihz6f791.png?width=3781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39d19e97ca69310bc92cc801fded758cea87f247)

**Phase 3: Buying the REAL Dip (SPY)--**  S&amp;P Price target? See burry tweet below. Once I buy SPY, I will finally be able to rest, as the previous steps will require extreme stress and paying more attention to the market than any autist should.

[Barring a miracle, I will not consider buying the S&amp;P until it nears 2000.](https://preview.redd.it/iolvthqj7f791.png?width=1625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b763c3f2c10fb782ccc3c5b514f0353c946c9ac3)

**Phase 4: Own Real Assets (Buy a House)--** Honestly getting tired of typing at this point. We all know that for each % increase in the federal funds rate, housing prices drop by like 10-20% or some bullshit. On top of this, the housing market moves much more slowly than the equities market, so I will have ample time to shop around after the slow inevitable decline of the housing market. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never thought owning a house would be in the cards for me (especially after I lost all my GME gains betting against Tesla). It's time for redemption of every bear who went short too early back in 2021. **It's time for us retail investors to weather this bust cycle and end up with MORE money than we started it with. LETS BUY BACK OUR HOUSES FROM THE BIG BANKS.**

"TSLA Options - profit from the dip?I'm a financially secure old guy who thought he could see the future, so I started buying TSLA in 2015.

Turns out, I was right about the future and I don't plan to sell a single share for at least five years, maybe ten.

In preparation for this playtime, I've opened a margin and options account with my broker.

Hypothetically, if I believed that TSLA stock would trade at or above $720 per share on or before May 14, 2021, and hypothetically, if I was willing to risk 100 of my 1,000 shares on that prediction, is there an options contract I could create to capitalize?

"$SPY - Predictions for the week of 2/28**----------Last Week----------**

I know this is predictions for the next week but first I would like to explain what happened when Russia invaded Ukraine and why the market rallied.  The markets reacted in anticipation for the invasion happening, when it actually happened it was already priced in which was one factor.

For those who do not know there is the technical indicator called bollinger bands where the 21 day moving average is calculated and then offset by one, two, and three standard deviations.  This is a very useful indicator as you can analyze the movements of the markets based on the normal distribution curve.  In normal distribution 68% percent of the data will occur within one standard deviation from the mean, 95% of the data within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% of the data within 3 standard deviations.  Over a large enough sample size the probability of the price of $SPY being further than 3 standard deviations away from the mean is less than 0.3%.  When markets opened Thursday morning the price was below the last bollinger band which happens very rarely.  Many high frequency trading algorithms noticed this and started buying like crazy causing a chain reaction which explains the market rallying Thursday and Friday.

A new trend pattern has been formed in the markets with a diamond top.  Lower lows and lower highs are being formed.  I would say these trend lines are are very weak indicator though, they can be broken or changed from many different factors.

Short term bonds are back on the way up with the yield curve starting to flatten again, this can be an indicator of an upcoming recession but I do not think that will happen because Jerome Powell is scared and cannot be tough on the economy like what happened in the 1980s.

Something really interesting I have noticed is that the energy sector in the markets has rallied compared to the S&amp;P 500.  Historically the energy sector will outperform the overall market during times of recessions.

**Predictions**

From the technical indicators the market has a bullish sentiment heading into Monday and Tuesday.  Except Monday will have some sort of drawdown because this crazy buying pressure has to slow.  Powell will be giving his testimony on the economy on Wednesday morning.  Also the February employment report is being released on Friday.  The entire market will be watching what Jerome Powell has to say on the economy and more specifically what he says on raising interest rates.

[Bill Ackman's Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/82krj56n08k81.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed010a5d21957f59e4fe96c91f22356596259644)

Bill Ackman gave a presentation to the Federal Reserve back in October warning them of the dangers from keeping interest rates 0% and from quantitative easing.  Bill Ackman has an influence on the federal reserve, he has also said the Federal Reserve needs to do one big rate hike to shock the markets and restore credibility.  I think when Jerome Powell talks he will mention that a 50bp rate hike is now being considered, like everything else that has happened recently this will cause the markets to violently overreact into the following days.  Wednesday will be a very volatile day, during Thursday and Friday the markets will gradually decline.

I made a fuck-up of deciding to be pessimistic on $AMD at the beginning of June before the bigger run-up. *$14 puts 08/17* At this point, I figure I'll wait for a nasty day and salvage what I have.

Double autistic was my $MU 1/19 position that I opened right before the great Chinese meme massacre.

d) Optimal Trade period -[https://i.imgur.com/IeRBBJ5.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IeRBBJ5.jpg)  


This is pretty interesting that it all red in and around earnings week but longer term does show positive return. Having taken a look at some of the options on AMD, the IV is incredibly high to warrant buying longer term calls right now. In the short term, any puts ATM/OTM is pretty much gambling. Only play I can see is deep ITM puts expiring within a week, though I'd probably recommend sitting this one out. 

tl;dr - Dont play this, but keeping in spirit of this sub, buy 20,19.5,19 puts expiring 3rd August. ",1

"SPY - Emotional rollercoasterI don't usually trade options, but all the shit that happened over this past weekend made me think there is no way SPY not gonna drop. Placed my order first thing on Monday morning, saw my book value slowly go up over the day, I couldn't even focus at work. I took like a 2hrs coffee break and 4hrs lunch, and all I did was keep clicking refresh to see how much I made. I was up thousands at the end of the day and though to myself, no way Trump would keep quiet about China lowering their currency and I should hold over night. And I was right, around 8pm Monday SPY was 277, I was up almost 10k. I couldn't even sleep that night. I know 10k is not a lot of money to most of you guys, but I have never made so much from 2 days of trading. At that moment, I believe I could do anything, I serious consider taking the rest of week off and go on a small vacation. Then came premarket, SPY open at 283, I thought the trading system was buggy and forgot the after hour trading value. Came 930am when it actually open, mother fucker, it open at 285. I only made thousands instead of 10k, and I believed SPY would go lower so I held onto the options. Then I see my thousands turn into hundreds over the day, and turn into nothing at the end of day. I didn't lost money, but I felt like shit. I kept thinking ""if I sold the day before or that morning I could have made thousands"", ""I shouldn't be greedy"", and ""if my options go back into money I will sell right away"". Came this morning, I see SPY dropped and my confidence was back....until 1030. I couldn't handle this kinda emotional rollercoaster, I sold everything at noon for a small small small profit. I dont think I can handle this again.......",0

"4-11-22 SPY (AMD, QQQ, F, Apple, VIX) Daily TA  

The day before CPI… the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my -2% red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20, 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days. 

The bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesn’t have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema (above for bearish and below for bullish).

We actually established yet another downward channel today that I don’t suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse.

We are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse. 

But on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I don’t really forsee (unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10% that we do it) but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.

The daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now.

The daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20, 50 and 100 ema on the daily (445.21, 446.55 and 446.63) but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised (again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected) for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside. 

Channel support is 437 and resistance is 451 (unlimited upside) BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I don’t suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However, we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema (443.96, 445.9). The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 (weekly 50). 

Another thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday (monthly option expiration). 

Wednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p. 

Thursday monthly has 15k 445c, 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p, 66k 435p, 113k 430p.

That is a massive amount of OI to the downside that’s expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps, we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too. 

With the last CPI being 7.5%, expected at 7.9% but the consensus at 8.4% its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war, gas prices, more covid, etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9%. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow.

Apple had a heck of a red day today too (mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today). I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not, however, expect it to happen today. However, I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning. 

Apple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel, with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However, my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here. 

Channel support tomorrow is 157 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However, if Apple loses 165.54 (daily 100ema) we can expect further downside this week. 

I currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may re-enter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish.

The blood for AMD just continues, but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive -5.2 hit which I believe it was down around -6% at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 72-74. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right. 

I am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema (tomorrow most likely) to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ford attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5%, however, after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.

Ford also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I don’t suspect the RSI to be an issue. 

Again took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position.

QQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how. 

Channel support is 322 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 342 for tomorrow. 

I also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420-430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ.

The VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11% from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels, but mind you that was on the downside not the upside. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI. 

Overall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising, 30 year fixed mortgages rising again, the inverted treasury yields, inflation, covid, war, gas, etc. etc. etc. recession, etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two. 

While some don’t think it’s a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of... took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling that’s the pre-ample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Today was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19%, a spy put for 20% and a call for 20%. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70% at open that spiked to -30% around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at -30%. I also played a call and put for -25% then -10% during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10% puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal, however, factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.",1
