I do not believe that Trump will let down or is actually bluffing. Even if the Chinese offer to negotiate, I doubt Trump actually wants to negotiate.

Trump is an authoritarian, and does not believe in accountability from other government institutions. What might he do to draw attention away from these things?

This package will grant him over 500 million dollars for market caps reached at 100 Billion and at 50 billion increments above that, vesting 1% of the shares outstanding per increment up to 12% of shares outstanding. It is reliant on market based milestones, which musk can influence with his public brand and on acquisitions to further integrate the company as a renewable energy company. The exercise price is that of TSLA shares on Jan 18 2018, around $350. Additionally the vesting is reliant on operational milestones involving increased revenues and EBIDTA. The operational requirements may be achieved through aggressive accounting practices and wouldn't be hurt by strange depreciation accounting that would improve FCF. In the current compensation plan, Musk is required to have TSLA achieve 30% or more in gross margins for several consecutive quarters. We have instances of capitalisation of expenses that has helped get TSLA’s margins close to that number in previous years. If Musk believes or sees that these milestones are unreachable, even with the zeal that he can inspire in his followers, he may very well jump ship. When you realise that they don't expense R&amp;D as cost of goods sold then you realise what is being done to inflate the gross margin figures.\n\n**Exhibit 2**\n\nSolarCity acquisition should have been illegal from a corporate governance point of view. Six of Tesla’s seven directors have clear ties to SolarCity. Tesla’s board includes SolarCity’s former CFO, a SolarCity director, and two VCs whose firms also have seats on SolarCity’s board, along with Musk’s brother, Kimbal. Musk chairs both companies and is SolarCity’s largest shareholder. He has taken out $475 million in personal credit lines to buy more shares in SolarCity and Tesla when advantageous. SpaceX, his aerospace company, has purchased $165 million in bonds issued by SolarCity. Some analysts cautioned that Musk might be self-dealing, rescuing his own investments and his cousins’ company through this purchase. Hedge-fund manager Jim Chanos, who had shorted Tesla and SolarCity, called the acquisition a “shameful example of corporate governance at its worst,” a “bailout” of SolarCity that “strikes us as just the height of folly.” SolarCity was not doing well, Chanos believed that it was on its way to bankruptcy, with its bonds yielding over 20% by the time that they were bought.\n\n**Exhibit 3**\n\nMusk’s public popularity raises valuations of the companies who he attaches himself to. He has been touted as the world’s Tony Stark. Just go to YouTube to watch the drivel that fanboys post about him. Recently and notably, Youtuber boyinaband has begun to celebrate Musk with his audience and the amount of absurd “thug life” and “MUSK DESTROYS” compilations on youtube is beginning to rival that of Jordan Peterson.\n\n**Exhibit 4**\n\nAlong with these liquid stock grants that further dilute shareholders, TSLA equity finances a lot, especially, it seems, when they assure shareholders that they have no plans to. They also issue a lot of debt, and are not transparent with their plans to raise capital. When asked about TSLA capital needs in last year’s Q2, Musk responded, “And now that said, there may be some wisdom in having a cash cushion for unexpected events. You just never know if there's going be some significant force majeure events in the world. It could be an earthquake in California, for example. But we're not at this point considering an equity raise. We are thinking about debt, but we're not thinking about an equity raise.” Considering that the Company announced the debt raise less than a week later and is already on a roadshow, management was clearly well past the “thinking about” stage at the time of Q2 earnings. In fact, the Company seems already well on its way to a raise in contacting debt rating agencies and planning for a roadshow. Readers can determine whether Tesla’s representation during earnings call was accurate. There are many other instances of this kind of behaviour by TSLA management, and is not a credit to their credibility. Their only positive cash flows come from financing activities and they now have a D/E of 2.22. It is clear from a quick look at their cash flow statements that even in 2017 they are raising far more debt than they are paying back. Also they keep claiming in their 10-K that they are innovative manufacturers, and are supremely safe, meanwhile they have to borrow Panasonic employees and are hand-assembling batteries, and they change their production forecasts downwards many times a season.\n\n\n\n**Exhibit 5**\n\nThey are becoming increasingly unprofitable as their revenues scale. This is highly unusual as one would expect that fixed costs would begin to be spread as they scale. This points to a break even point at lower rather than higher than current sales volumes given the current infrastructure. This of course would run completely contrary to their plans of becoming an all round provider of sustainable energy vehicles and other products. Their interest expenses have also more than doubled moving into 2017, with precipitous increases in SG&amp;A expenses. These lower incomes are not as a result of higher R&amp;D costs, as those have risen less than proportionally. Their EPS fell by 200% from 2016 to 2017.\n\n**Exhibit 6**\n\nOther than Elon Musk, CFO Deepak Ahuja and CTO J.B. Straubel no other executives are listed on its website, its investor relations page or in the annual report filings. Over the last year over 30 Executives and directors have left the company including chiefs in accounting and the CFO and the head of the Autopilot engineering division. This is an especially bad sign and is the hallmark of a failing company.\n\n**Exhibit 7**\n\nTSLA are no longer leaders in the most vigorous part of automobiles, which is autonomous vehicles. Among the largest market cap automobile manufacturers, TSLA has relatively unsophisticated autonomy in cars so far, trailing even behind GM. Considering that they were touted as pioneers in this field, with their first forays with NVDA, this does not bode well. Also given the lack of scrutiny that investors place on Musk, most likely the stock price still has expectations of leadership in autonomous vehicles baked into the price.\n\n**Exhibit 8**\n\nMany other incumbents are catching up to TSLA in high end EVs, and already has a presence in economy EVs segment. The market is very competitive and there is no reason to expect that TSLA will become leaders. Also TSLA has huge reliability issues according to TrueDelta.com, ranking as the most unreliable car purchasable in America.\n\n**Exhibit 9**\n\nTesla may not be eligible for the subsidies granted by the government, given that the Model S pollutes more than a Jeep on a per mile basis in the US, when accounting for the pollution in production and recharging.\n\n**Exhibit 10**\n\nTax credits in the US will no longer benefit TSLA in its Solar Energy provisions post December 2021. The services that they provide will no longer be tax exempt for residences. Expenditures only include set up costs, set up services are also provided by TSLA. By 2025, economic benefits for electric cars will also disappear in Norway if gas cars become banned. People will then flock to other auto manufacturers producing electric cars as the demand for TSLA exceeds supply.\n\n* Quoted from the 10-K risk section:\n\n&gt;We currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles. In the U.S. and abroad, such incentives include, among other things, tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees, the 25% value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. Notably, the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gas-powered vehicles through the oil and gas industries. Nevertheless, even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted. For example, in April 2017 and January 2016, respectively, previously available incentives in Hong Kong and Denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired, negatively impacting sales. Moreover, under current regulations, a $7,500 federal tax credit available in the U.S. for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles with at least 17 kWh of battery capacity, such as our vehicles, will begin to phase out over time with respect to any vehicles delivered in the second calendar quarter following the quarter in which we deliver our 200,000th qualifying vehicle in the U.S. We currently expect such 200,000th qualifying delivery to occur at some point during 2018. In addition, California implemented regulations phasing out a $2,500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for high-income consumers, which became effective in March 2016. In certain circumstances, there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interests to bring about such developments, which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles.\n\nThis will all further fuck their shitty cash flows.\n\n**Exhibit 11**\n\nReservation deposits are another way to finance the company.\n\n**Exhibit 12**\n\nVerbiage is relatively extravagant, overstating or emphasising features of their products that are not differentiating and are completely expected given their sector. For example their use of inverters, that they write their own software, make their own UI, the autopilot feature which is reportedly not better than many competitors and the fact that their power storage is infinitely scalable. Also they claim that they have core competencies in powertrain engineering, vehicle engineering, innovative manufacturing and energy storage, then they disclose in the risk section that they HAVE NO EXPERIENCE TO DATE IN MANUFACTURING VEHICLES IN HIGH VOLUMES. Clearly they are not competent in their core competencies. In producing the Model 3, they were so incapable of meeting demand that some of the production line is by hand, there were constant bottlenecks, quality control employees were totally inexperienced is automobiles. Batteries could be defective and management apparently didn’t care. Apparently their stress tests aren’t efficient either.\n\n**Exhibit 13**\n\nSolar City’s lease agreement model is highly risky for homeowners to agree to, it puts their house to a commitment to pay rising prices for a technology whose efficiency and cost is decreasing in the long term. It’s like buying a 20 year bond when you know rates are going up, it’s totally retarded and becomes a huge liability on the house when you need to sell it, because only a braindead idiot would want to buy a house on which they are forced to pay a coupon out to Solar City on a less than optimal solar rig. It’s like a subprime lending company. And Solar City won’t be able to compete against highly subsidised and technologically advanced solar manufacturers like DQ in China in the regular solar panel sales market. They have no claim on the residential market. Also it’s worth mentioning that Elon’s cousins run the company, and Elon is majority shareholder. So he basically bailed his family out of this shitty company when he bought it. It’s as cancerous as Goldman Sachs.\n\n**Exhibit 14**\n\nOut of warranty, Teslas become extremely expensive, especially since the way they’re built and service policies require less modular servicing. The battery costs 12000 dollars to replace for the Model S, and 40000 dollars for the Roadster, door handles cost 1000 dollars to replace each, and apparently they’re highly unreliable, 5000 dollars to replace the touchscreen which can become discoloured or even misaligned leading to freezing. Drive unit replacement would cost 6000 dollars out of pocket, which is composed of the entire so called power train, this is the source of the lack of modularity in repairs. Also TSLA does not support the used car market very well, apparently parts for salvage vehicles are impossible to acquire for “safety reasons”, even though competitor electric car makers do provide salvage parts, and it is not possible to see the service history of a used car.\n\n**Exhibit 15**\n\nTesla has a penchant for forecasting very unrealistic production numbers. Their forecasts for weekly production at the beginning of the year were 5000 units of the Model 3 per week by Q2. They said they’d have this production rate by mid 2017 before, and now they're making about 700 units a week, when they said they'd pull off 2500 by the end of Q1. Also TSLA has started issuing VIN insequencially, so it is more difficult to track production rates and service rates of newer vehicles.\n\n**Exhibit 16**\n\nWhile most investors are aware Tesla had received 518,000 Model 3 reservations as-of early August, 63,000 of which had been cancelled (12.16%), few know the problems Tesla has faced trying to get their own employees to convert Model 3 deposits to reservations. Tesla and SpaceX employees placed an estimated 13,000 Model 3 reservations and Tesla was counting on this army of employee beta testers, bound by NDAs and the threat of being fired (or worse, losing their stock option grants) to beta-test the Model 3 without leaking details to the public. Quite surprisingly, on November 15th Tesla sent out the first batch of Model 3 configuration invitations to non-employees (Electrek reported non-employee configurations on November 21st) with the first known non-employee VIN assigned November 22nd and the earliest confirmed non-employee delivery on December 20th. Based on Tesla’s fourth quarter production and delivery press release, a total of 1,892 Model 3s had been produced prior to December 21st - indicating the estimated 13,000 employee Model 3 reservations translated into perhaps 1,500 firm orders (11.5%).\n\n**Exhibit 17**\n\nThe price is just too high on the Model 3, which is supposed to be their mass market product. Tesla is only shipping the ‘Long Range’ Model 3 loaded with mandatory options: Not only are there very few $51,000+ compact sedans in the world (for good reason), reservations holders initially believed they were purchasing a $35,000 vehicle ($25,000 net of Federal and State tax credits) with $5,000 to $10,000 of potential options. The shift in pricing likely explains our estimated 11.5% conversion rate on Tesla’s 13,000 employee Model 3 reservations - these are primarily hourly workers, after all! Apparently sales in the Model 3 price range is just 1/6th of the sales in the 20k-30k. So much for mass market.\n\n**Exhibit 18**\n\nOn the gross margin front, due to Tesla’s ‘unique’ accounting, we forecast gross margins of 15% to 20% for the Model 3 at average sales prices $46,500 per copy - but this will merely be an accounting mirage: If we apply traditional automaker accounting to our Model 3 forecasts - reducing the sales price by 10% to re-allocate SG&amp;A (19.41% at Tesla versus 7% for Ford and GM) as well as include expensed R&amp;D in COGS, the $46,500 Model 3 would generate gross margins of –7.48%. The irony is that Tesla’s bull case (a mainstream car) is finally here, quite possibly bringing about their downfall (via massively flawed business model). The way this happens is by reducing the gross margin by the 10% discount that regular automakers give to dealerships, that save them SG&amp;A expenses, TSLA’s gross margins look nothing special. But when you realise that TSLA expenses R&amp;D costs that should be in in COGS in a separate line, since it’s development on current vehicles, the gross margins are actually much worse than the other companies.\n\n* Cost of Revenue - TSLA\nAutomotive\nCost of automotive revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead (including amortized tooling costs), shipping and logistic costs, vehicle internet connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive revenue also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write-down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for on-hand inventory that is either obsolete or in excess of forecasted demand. -- (NOTICE NO EXPENSED R&amp;D)\n\n\n* GM - Research and Development Expenditures \nResearch and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive cost of sales, were $7.3 billion, $6.6 billion and $6.0 billion in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering, design and development activities. Cost sharing payments and fees related to these arrangements are presented in Automotive cost of sales.\n\n\n\n", 'label': -1}, {'text': '"$AAPL - Now in (RED)®"™', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'AMD calls are so expensive, might as well buy shares?Shit will hit 12 by earnings as usual. but calls spendy af.

With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I\'ve been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.\n\nSince you all love throwing your money away, I\'ll share how I play FDs. I cannot understate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won\'t go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you\'re serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.\n\nI only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I\'ll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It\'s possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I\'ll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don\'t go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. \n\nIn my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn\'t a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you\'re only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don\'t mess with FDs if I\'m only looking at a realistic upside of 500%. \n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**\n-\n\nI haven\'t bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I\'ve bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. \n\nSo, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn\'t like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ\'s results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn\'t have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.\n\nThus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.\n\n-\n\n**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you\'ll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. \n\n1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. \n\n2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We\'re banking on some unexpected volatility. \n\n3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it\'s all over. \n\n4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. \n\n5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ\'s average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I\'m predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that\'s more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it\'s a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ\'s yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday\'s close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.\n\n6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren\'t really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.\n\n-\n\nAnd now onto the actual play.\n\n* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**\n\nThese are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday\'s closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. \n\nIf this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say "Wednesday noon", I don\'t actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. \n\nThese estimates are going to be off because we\'re dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you\'re trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I\'m not wrong often.\n\nBy the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you\'re down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.\n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Apple ($AAPL)**\n-\n\nI personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I\'ll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. \n\n* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**\n\nThese calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. \n\nReasoning in decreasing significance: \n\n1. Apple\'s earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. \n\n2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn\'t only because they\'re both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. \n\n3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. \n\n4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn\'t a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don\'t go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. \n\n5. With the tax cuts and Apple\'s big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they\'re good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.\n\n-\n\nAs always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there\'s a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn\'t go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road.

If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.\n\n6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren\'t really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.\n\n-\n\nAnd now onto the actual play.\n\n* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**\n\nThese are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday\'s closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. \n\nIf this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say "Wednesday noon", I don\'t actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. \n\nThese estimates are going to be off because we\'re dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you\'re trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I\'m not wrong often.\n\nBy the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you\'re down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.\n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Apple ($AAPL)**\n-\n\nI personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I\'ll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. \n\n* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**\n\nThese calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. \n\nReasoning in decreasing significance: \n\n1. Apple\'s earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. \n\n2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn\'t only because they\'re both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. \n\n3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. \n\n4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn\'t a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don\'t go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. \n\n5. With the tax cuts and Apple\'s big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they\'re good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.\n\n-\n\nAs always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there\'s a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn\'t go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road.

With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I\'ve been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.\n\nSince you all love throwing your money away, I\'ll share how I play FDs. I cannot understate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won\'t go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you\'re serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.\n\nI only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I\'ll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It\'s possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I\'ll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don\'t go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. \n\nIn my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn\'t a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you\'re only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don\'t mess with FDs if I\'m only looking at a realistic upside of 500%. \n\n-\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-\n\n**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**\n-\n\nI haven\'t bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I\'ve bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. \n\nSo, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn\'t like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ\'s results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn\'t have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.\n\nThus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.\n\n-\n\n**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you\'ll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. \n\n1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. \n\n2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We\'re banking on some unexpected volatility. \n\n3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it\'s all over. \n\n4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. \n\n5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ\'s average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I\'m predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that\'s more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it\'s a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ\'s yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday\'s close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.\n\n6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren\'t really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.\n\n-\n\nAnd now onto the actual play.\n\n* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**\n\nThese are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday\'s closing bid-ask spread.

But it was hard for anyone in her school to satisfy her.\n\nShe had her eyes on a guy that her sisters were seeing on and off. Jealousy bubbled up whenever she would hear their orgasm induced screams from all night sessions. The whole town's women tremble when his name is uttered. The exagerrated reputation Amazon had was part of his deadly charm. Some say his thrust has enough power to get to low earth orbit, some say he has traveled the world and knows 40 languages, others say he could guarantee satisfaction within 48 hours. Either way, curiosity was getting to the best of her and so she plotted a way for their paths to cross.\n\nOne night, after her sister was throughly exhausted in another session, she positioned herself near the door way in nothing but a towel. As the door opened, she gasped at the sight of a giant of a man. Standing at 7 feet tall with bulging muscles all over and a staff the size of an arm, she nearly orgasmed simply from his towering figure. Without a word, Amazon grappled her by the throat and forced his enormous manhood down her mouth. Holding back her tears, RAD felt her gag reflex kick in immediately and her own cough being clogged by the newly formed air seal.

I've been thinking about buying puts on it since it was trading at 350. So I thought this was as good a time as any to jump into options. So I bought 5 contracts at 10.74. (Note, I have a long-term equity position of &gt;500k. It was not a huge gamble for me.)\n\n**Rest of the week of June 20th**\n\nI think NFLX rose quickly to ~416 that week and my puts were down to ~9 at some point. I was beginning to think it's too easy to lose money with this.\nLooking back, the rest of the week was uneventful even though I occasionally got excited about ~10% movements in quote price. \nThe puts closed at around 10 on Friday. I thought I might as well see how it goes the next week.\n\n**Monday June 25th**\n\nAs you probably know, Monday was crazy. There was fear that Trump will limit Chinese investments in tech and all shits hit the fan.\nNFLX quickly fell below 390. My puts were up to ~17-19 range. (It wasn't a happy morning for me though, b/c my long term holdings were down &gt;15k from the pullback.)\nNFLX was stabilizing at around 384. All of previous week, I was anxious about a big loss from first options trade. So I was thinking it's better to make a quick profit rather than risking big loss from my first trade.\nOn the other hand, I didn't want to close the trade so soon because I really thought that NFLX was vulnerable, and there is a chance that it could crash further. So I took the middle road and sold 3 contracts at 17.95 at about 11AM. (The price was selected to make back my initial investment. i.e. the 2 remaining contracts are pure profits)\n\nNot much happened in rest of the day. I think the puts had a high of ~19, so I sold at a pretty good price.\n\n**Tuesday June 26th**\n\nIt seems all worry about Chinese investments are gone. NFLX shot up &gt;4% in one day. My puts were down to 12. I regretted not selling at ~18 when I had the chance. Oh well.\n\n**Wednesday June 27th**\n\nNFLX was over 400 again, my puts were down to 10, 11 at some point in the morning. I was beginning to feel sad about missing out on more quick profits. I couldn't decide between bagholding or cashing out for the 2k profit.\nSomehow, there was some new fear about trade policy in the afternoon, NFLX quickly fell to ~393.

There really was a time where people didn\'t know what "online" meant. Not everyone had a computer back then, maybe you knew someone who\'s family had one. When I was a kid I played one computer game and I had to have one. It was like 6 years later that it was cheap enough for my family to get one. Then it wasn\'t until I had my own money did I wind up on Amazon-- looking for something to buy that I couldn\'t get at Fred Myers or at the shops downtown. I don\'t really remember what I bought but I remember thinking how cool it was that something I wanted just came to my house. It\'s like being God, except you pay money to do it.\n\nSo sometimes I would buy stuff on Amazon. Usually around the Holidays or when I needed PC parts (Newegg mostly though). There was a lot of cool stuff you could buy on Amazon, like anything you needed. It just didn\'t make sense, because it took like a week to get something you could drive to the store for. That\'s before shipping costs. So, I bought a few things on Amazon from time to time.\n\nI always got my stuff when they said it would arrive. I had never had a bad experience with Amazon really. Then one year I bought my mom a Kindle fire. She loved reading books, so it was perfect. She loved it. She bought so many books. Every day I saw her she had that Kindle. It lasted a little over a year. Out of warranty. So, I did what anyone would do and emailed Jeff Bezos and asked something along the lines of:\n\n\'what the heck mother trucker, your stupid great product failed the questionably short warranty expired. That\'s fucked up.\' \n\nTo my surprise I got an email back, from someone at Amazon stating that Jeff had asked them to respond to my email. The gist of what I recall was that the person told me \'sucks to suck, you can buy the new Kindle Fire HD though\'. I was upset, but I couldn\'t not buy my mom a new Kindle. So, I did. I still shopped at Amazon after a cooling off period, like a week, then I bought some shorts or something idk. That Kindle Fire HD lasted up until last year though. \n\nNow, I buy everything on Amazon. I live in Seattle, so it\'s their testing ground. I get all my groceries of Amazon, with their Fresh Service. I can almost anything you need delivered within an hour if you want with Prime Now, or in two hours for free. I can get clothes to try on for a week and send back what I don\'t like (also sunglasses). Bulk deals are getting better with Pantry. The Treasure Truck shit is crazy.\n\nThe only thing I don\'t buy on Amazon is cigarettes and like snacks or a drink at work or walking around. They recently launched that Amazon GO store in January, you know the one where you just walk in and walk out. They\'re already putting up another and it says opening in the Fall. So, I\'ll probably get my snacks/drinks from there since it\'s close. I think Jeff has something against Tobacco cause it\'s the one thing they don\'t sell, you can buy Alcohol from the GO stores. \n\nEveryone I know is the same up here, some still go to grocery stores but they\'re also the ones who have a family, cars, and go to Costco. But they use Amazon for everything else. They have local market stuff, plus Whole Foods now. The everyday brand stuff is a good deal in my book-- and it keeps getting better. Plus, I can put in an order at like 8 pm to have something that gets to my place at fucking 6:30 in the morning.\n\nIt\'s some dark arts kind wizardry the fact that it\'s always here, always early, and always right.

Instead of gambling &amp; holding SPY calls overnight (which I still do sometimes when I predict daily/weekly/monthly moves) I've found it can be just as rewarding -again if you have the time, real-time quotes, &amp; an inclination for yolo- to day trade SPY. The logic is that SPY has been inversing itself in the first hour or so of trading recently which can bring huge gains on options about to expire. Basically you buy slightly OTM options (&lt;$1) w/ expiry either the next day or the day you're trading at the low, and sell high.\n\nYeah. Obviously this is risky AF as theta seriously works against you and if SPY doesn't rise or fall fast enough you're screwed, not to mention if it goes the wrong way. A stop loss isn't a bad idea but gaps will hurt as well as the fact that you dont want to sell down 20% only to have it go up 100% (which happens all the time).\n\nAn example is today (or all last week...) SPY challenged 282.50 for the second time at approx 11am (bit later than usual) and I had my market order of 200 shares (fidelity's limit) ready to go on 282p. I wound up not executing because I wasn't positive of action, last monday we mooned and wasn't sure how today/this week would trade, if we would be held back by fed on weds, along with BA &amp; FB selloff (obviously we were and there's a reason why I'm on r/wsb).

Negatives for Intel include: CPU IPC has been largely stagnant for the past FOUR years. For those not familiar, IPC is Instructions Per Clock. It has nothing to do with the number of CPU cores, or the speed of a chip, and is entirely about how many instructions are executed per clock cycle. So a 2.0GHz chip with ah higher IPC will perform better than a 2.0GHz chip with a lower IPC. If the clock speeds increase, performance will go up, but newer chips with the same IPC won't be any faster when running at that 2.0GHz speed.\n\nWith Inte, 10nm being delayed itself would just mean that clock speeds won't go up, but a lack of any IPC improvements show that Intel is not improving the design of its chips well enough. So, what has Intel been doing over the past FOUR years where IPC hasn't improved? Intel finally improved the thermal interface material for better cooling of the chip itself(under the cover), so you see some speed increases, but there were already enthusiasts who were removing the lid from the chip to do this improvement themselves;, and the results has shown that the chips themselves have not really been improved, the news chips have better assembly.\n\nSo, AMD....When AMD first launched Ryzen in 2017, many people were surprised, if not shocked. Not only did AMD release 8 core chips(while Intel had stayed with 4 core chips) in the consumer space, but the new Zen core design was fairly competitive on an IPC basis as well. This allowed AMD to be every competitive with their new chips, and the only advantage that Intel had was a slight advantage in IPC, as well as high clock speeds. AMD offering double the number of cores did make Ryzen a very competitive product in most areas. Since that time, AMD boosted the IPC from first to second generation, as well as providing a bit better clock speed. Looking forward, the third generation Ryzen chips are expected in the next months (announcement and specs due on May 27th), with a 13-15% IPC improvement over second generation, and potentially a jump of 20% in clock speeds. Yes, this is a 20% boost on top of the 13-15% performance boost even at the previous speeds, so you can see how big of a jump this is expected to be, depending on clock speeds.\n\nAMD isn't stagnant in IPC, isn't stagnant in clock speeds, and may even double the core counts to 16 cores in consumer grade chips. This is why things look very promising for AMD in the second half of 2019. Intel isn't expected to have 10nm desktop chips ready before 2021 at this point, so that is why those who understand the technology see so much potential for AMD right now. AMD has at the very least, a year where it will be well ahead of Intel. Q1 and Q2 are the periods before the new chips are released, and many are waiting to buy the new chips, so a slowdown in sales SHOULD be expected.\n\n***TLDR - SU BAE WILL GIVE US THE GOODS IN THE SECOND HALF***\n\n**SHORT TERM** 5/3 $29/28.5P  \n**LONG TERM** 11/15 $28C", 'label': -1}, {'text': 'TSLA to $4,000.

It seems as though this announcement may not come until July at the earliest, however, MSFT already has partnerships with DOD with Hololens.\n\nI bought some June/July calls when we hit these recent lows.

The performance impact alone can, according to Intel, be as high as 9%, and this leaps up to nearly 50% if you also (as many recommend) turn off hyperthreading. The article is long, but well worth a read. I\'ve bolded the following two excerpts from the full text:\n\n**According to the VU, Intel tried to downplay the severity of the leak by officially paying $40,000 in reward and "$80,000" in addition. That offer was politely refused.**\n\n**"If it were up to Intel, they would have wanted to wait another six months"**\n\nSource here: [https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/05/14/hackers-mikken-op-het-intel-hart-a3960208](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/05/14/hackers-mikken-op-het-intel-hart-a3960208)\n\nTranslation from Dutch to English:\n\n# VU discovers megaleak in Intel chips\n\nThanks to a mistake, the VU uncovered a mega breach in Intel chips. Intel pays the price for a fast but risky design.\n\nThe news in brief:\n\n* **Researchers from the VU University Amsterdam have found an extensive data breach that is present in all Intel processors. These chips are in more than 80 percent of all computers and servers.**\n* **On Tuesday evening, Intel and VU announced the details of RIDL (Rogue In-Flight Data Load), a vulnerability that allows malicious parties to "steal almost all data" from computers. Unauthorized persons can view the data that the processor is currently processing.**\n* **The vulnerability is in all Intel processors of the last ten years - including the very latest. Hackers can exploit the vulnerability by hiding code in a web advertisement.**\n\nTwo rack cabinets from the Ikea full of computer walls, a jumble of cables and a stack of second-hand processors. It is not immediately the test lab that you expect from which VU University researchers uncovered the sophisticated, super-complex leak in recent months.\n\nHere, in room P455, on the fourth floor of the W&amp;N building in Amsterdam, it was demonstrated that all Intel processors of the past ten years are susceptible to a major leak. This means that more than 80 percent of all computers in the world are susceptible to an attack that gives access to data at the heart of the computer.\n\nRIDL, as the new vulnerability was baptized, came to light by chance. On Tuesday 11 September, Stephan van Schaijk, Computer Science student at VU University Amsterdam, worked on his study assignment: investigating a leak in the Intel processor.\n\nVan Schaijk: „I was busy for an hour but did not advance. I adjusted something in my code and then I saw something strange appear on the screen. Values \u200b\u200bI did not expect. "\n\nVan Schaijk had made a mistake, a bug in a bug, with which he could suddenly watch what happened in another program. It was a bigger and more serious leak than he was actually looking for.\n\nHis colleagues and teachers were just as surprised. Together, they wrote more than 20 "exploits" attack scenarios in a short time that would allow hackers to take control of the computer.\n\nOne of those tricks: by logging in with an incorrect password, the attacker forces the computer to compare the wrong password with the correct password. This data runs through the \'pipelines\' of the chip and can be intercepted, after which the hacker can retrieve the correct password after some tinkering. "You find fragments. As if you are going to get a paper document through the shredder and then reassemble the shreds, ”says Herbert Bos, professor of system and network security at the VU.\n\nStephan van Schaijk was sent out to buy as many different processors as possible, to see if they were all vulnerable.\n\nAnd that was true. Even the oldest one, from 2008, that was picked up via Marktplaats, turned out to be vulnerable to RIDL, or Rogue In-Flight Data Load. And so, Intel was immediately warned.\n\nA beer please\n\nIt is not the first time that Intel gets into trouble with a leak in its processors. The chip is extra fast because it is ahead of things: each time the processor speculates which data is probably needed next. This presents risks because computer processes do not remain well separated from each other.\n\nAssistant professor Kaveh Razavi compares it to a café: the processor works like a waitress who assumes that you want to drink the same as the one before you. The glass is poured automatically without the waitress checking whether you can have that beer.\n\nThe solution: the tray must be emptied after every order. That makes the processor slower. Depending on the programs you use, the speed difference can be considerable, the researchers expect. That explains why Intel has been struggling so long to fix this leak.\n\nRIDL cuts right through all existing security layers. This applies to the data centers where virtual systems often run on the same server. The encrypted environment that Intel devised for business customers is also vulnerable.\n\nPremium with aftertaste\n\nAlthough parts of the leak were found by several researchers from different universities and companies, the VU has discovered the majority. Amsterdam University is also the only party to receive a reward: $100,000 (89,000 euros), Intel\'s maximum reward for discoverers of critical leaks.\n\nThere is a small taste to the premium. **According to the VU, Intel tried to downplay the severity of the leak by officially paying $40,000 in reward and "$80,000" in addition. That offer was politely refused.**\n\nAnyone who accepts a reward must also adhere to the rules. In this case, that meant: no consultation between researchers and uncertainty about which software manufacturers were warned in advance. According to the researchers, tech companies do not reason in the interests of the user, but of the shareholder.\n\nIntel initially failed to notify Google and Mozilla, two major browser manufacturers.\n\nThe VU tried to force the manufacturer to come out faster. Eventually the VU forced Intel to come out in May - otherwise the university would publish the details itself. "**If it were up to Intel, they would have wanted to wait another six months**," says Bos.\n\nIntel had promised that the next generation of chips would not be vulnerable to RIDL, but that is not the case.\n\nHackers usually anticipate software vulnerabilities. Undiscovered holes (zero days) in important programs are sold for a lot of money in the black circuit. But after Specter and Meltdown, two fundamental holes that were previously found in Intel chips, both the ethical computer experts and the criminal figures are pointing their hardware. "Processors have become so complex that chip makers no longer have security under control," said Bos.\n\nAnd what should you do as a computer user? Update, update and update again. It is expected that all major software manufacturers will close the gap or have already closed the latest releases. It\'s not for nothing that RIDL comes out on Patch Tuesday, the monthly update day from Microsoft.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/boyhwo/intel\\_tried\\_to\\_bribe\\_vu\\_university\\_amsterdam\\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/boyhwo/intel_tried_to_bribe_vu_university_amsterdam_into/)', 'label': 1}, {'text': '5/15 SPY 300C: Goodnight, sweet prince.We are gathered here today to mourn the loss of 5/15 SPY 300 calls.

There are over 10,000 unique parts and processes at Tesla, so making small improvements across the board has a giant cumulative impact.\n\nAt the same time, we must also continue to make our products subtly better in thousands of small ways.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that we lost $700 million in the first quarter this year, which is over $200 million per month. Investors nonetheless were supportive of our efforts and agreed to give us $2.4 billion (our net proceeds) to show that we can be financially sustainable.\n\nThat is a lot of money, but actually only gives us approximately ten months at the first-quarter burn rate to achieve breakeven. It’s vital that we respect the faith investors have shown in Tesla, but it will require great effort to do so.\n\nThat is why, going forward, all expenses of any kind anywhere in the world, including parts, salary, travel expenses, rent, literally every payment that leaves our bank account must be reviewed, confirmed as critical and the top of every page of outgoing payments signed by our CFO.\n\nI will personally review and sign every 10th page.\n\nPlease examine closely every expense where responsibility is, or probably should be, assigned to your group. If in doubt, assume it is on your plate, so that we don’t have anything slip through the cracks.\n\nThis will take at least a few weeks to get right. Please don’t worry if it isn’t correct at first.\n\nThis is hardcore, but it is the only way for Tesla to become financially sustainable and succeed in our goal of helping make the world environmentally sustainable.\n\nThanks again for your excellent work,\n\nElon', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Tesla has convertibles?

As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That’s because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we’re introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features – Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance – help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.\n\n[Elon Musk Makes $500 Billion Autonomy Pitch to Investors | May 2 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-02/musk-is-said-to-make-500-billion-autonomy-pitch-to-investors)\n\nThe chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a “half-trillion dollar market cap company,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn’t open to the public.

Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we’re announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.\n\n[Tesla’s Model 3 was the best-selling EV in the world last year | Feb 22 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236707/tesla-model-3-2018-best-selling-ev-global)\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.\n\n[Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)\n\nAccording to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017— and that doesn’t even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it’s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a “Standby” state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car’s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alert” state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alarm” state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car’s audio system. If a car switches to “Alarm” state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They’ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.\n\n# [Leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/management)\n\n**Elon Musk - CEO**\n\nElon oversees the company\'s product strategy -- including the design, engineering and manufacturing of electric vehicles and battery products for consumers.

In this new version, drivers will now have the option to use Navigate on Autopilot without having to confirm lane changes via the turn stalk.\n\n[Musk Hints Tesla Pickup Truck Will Make Ram Seem "Puny" | Mar 31, 2019](https://insideevs.com/news/343601/musk-hints-tesla-pickup-truck-will-make-ram-seem-puny/)\n\nOf course, we need some context here to explain what Musk is referring to, so here\'s the tweets:@RamLover69 You would still be physically fatigued if you tried to haul 12,000 lbs of steel beams like I do every day with my Dodge Ram, 2019s motor trend truck of the year.@elonmusk 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children’s toys?It\'s not a secret that Tesla is working on an electric pickup truck. In fact, it\'s scheduled to be revealed sometime later this year. As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with "crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard," noted Musk in a previous tweet. We suspect that whatever a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150 can do, Tesla will one-up those figures.\n\n[Musk Says Tesla \\`Would Love to Be\' in India This Year or Next | March 15 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-15/musk-says-tesla-would-love-to-be-in-india-this-year-or-next)\n\nElon Musk isn’t giving up on bringing Tesla Inc. to India. “Would love to be there this year. If not, definitely next!” Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer said in a Twitter post, nearly ten months after he blamed restrictive policy for delaying the carmaker’s entry into the world’s fourth largest automobile market.\n\n[Tesla Model Y announced: release set for 2020, price starts at $47,000 | Mar 14 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264446/tesla-model-y-suv-compact-announcement-price-release-date-features-elon-musk)\n\nThe specs weren’t much of a surprise either: the long-range Model Y has a range of 300 miles and seating for seven. A performance version of the vehicle is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. “It has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,” Musk said. “So this thing will be really tight on corners.” The $47,000 long-range Model Y will come first in the fall of 2020, and it will have a range of 300 miles, Musk said. Tesla will also sell an all-wheel drive dual-motor version for $51,000 and a performance version for $60,000 — both of which will be available in fall 2020. The cheaper, standard range version with a range of 230 miles won’t be available until 2021, Musk said. It will sell for $39,000.\n\n[Introducing V3 Supercharging | March 6 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)\n\nTesla has more than 12,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia and our network continues to grow daily: more than 99% of the U.S. population is covered by the network, and we anticipate similar coverage in Europe by the end of 2019. Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we’re announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.\n\n[Tesla’s Model 3 was the best-selling EV in the world last year | Feb 22 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236707/tesla-model-3-2018-best-selling-ev-global)\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.\n\n[Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)\n\nAccording to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017— and that doesn’t even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it’s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a “Standby” state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car’s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alert” state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alarm” state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car’s audio system. If a car switches to “Alarm” state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They’ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.\n\n# [Leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/management)\n\n**Elon Musk - CEO**\n\nElon oversees the company\'s product strategy -- including the design, engineering and manufacturing of electric vehicles and battery products for consumers. Elon has been fascinated by electric cars for two decades. After earning bachelor\'s degrees in physics and business from the University of Pennsylvania, he worked briefly on ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research in Silicon Valley to understand their potential as an energy storage mechanism for EVs. He planned to do graduate studies at Stanford in materials science and applied physics but put school on hold to start Internet companies Zip2 and PayPal. In addition to his Tesla duties, he leads SpaceX,where he oversees the development and manufacturing of advanced rockets and spacecraft for missions to and beyond Earth orbit.\n\n**JB Straubel - CTO**\n\nAt Tesla, JB focuses on technical direction and engineering design including battery technology, power electronics, motors, software, firmware and controls. In addition to his work at Tesla, JB is also a lecturer at his alma mater, Stanford University, where he created and teaches an engineering class and lab focused on energy storage integration (CEE 176C) in the Engineering Department. JB has had a lifelong interest in electric vehicles, including rebuilding an electric gold cart at the age of 14, building an Electric Porsche 944 that held a world EV racing record, solar car racing and building a hybrid trailer system that he designed while in college. In 2008 the MIT Technology Review chose JB as “#1 Innovator of 35 under 35 for the year”. In 2009 DesignNews named him “Engineer of the Year”. And in 2015 he was listed as #2 on Fortune’s 40 under 40 most influential business and innovation leaders. JB in an inventor on over 30 patents covering most areas of Tesla’s core battery, motor and controls systems.\n\n# Technical analysis\n\nLong term, heavy amount of support at $189.82\n\n[Monthly chart](https://i.redd.it/zvng31wtksz21.png)\n\n# Institutions\n\nBaillie Gifford and Company, Capital Investors, Public Investors Fund, The Vanguard Group, Blackrock, Jennison, Fidelity and State Street are the largest institutional investors in Tesla respectively, collectively making up over 33% of ownership.', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'AAPL wanted to buy TSLA and fire Elon Muskhttps://www.ibtimes.com/apple-wanted-buy-tesla-fire-elon-musk-2013-2793927', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'AAPL wanted to buy TSLA and fire Elon Muskhttps://www.ibtimes.com/apple-wanted-buy-tesla-fire-elon-musk-2013-2793927', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'AAPL wanted to buy TSLA and fire Elon Muskhttps://www.ibtimes.com/apple-wanted-buy-tesla-fire-elon-musk-2013-2793927', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'AAPL wanted to buy TSLA and fire Elon Muskhttps://www.ibtimes.com/apple-wanted-buy-tesla-fire-elon-musk-2013-2793927', 'label': 1}, {'text': "Tsla.

As some may know, I've made some good ones in my short month as a member. If you followed me and did what I said you'd be way green. I've made about 12k since being a member.. It started after antitrust news and I predicted a surging ADBE because it dropped and had nothing to do with that, then went on and predicted FBs huge rise when it was at a laughable 170, my latest gem was a couple days ago when I predicted a quick rise in CRM. And while CRM is likely not done and will reach 160s by next week, I'm on to new things.\n\nAdmittedly, this new prediction isn't my usual variety. I tend to target stocks that have fallen for what I consider fake reasons, and are due for a recovery to their normal trading range. Thos is normally news related drops. Was the case with ADBE, FB, and CRM. All of which are back to their ranges so new opportunity is limited, but CRM still has potential. This new prediction isn't technically undervalued, or even below its normal trading range, two metrics I normally use, but it is affected by recent news that could affect it and recent price movement that helps gauge it. I'll explain.\n\nPrediction: AMD for tomorrow, and possibly Friday. It could reach as high as 34, but probably closer to 32. It was trading in the 27-29.5 range for weeks, back and forth, so we already know it is capable of seesawing. Once it broke 29.5 resistance that is now its support, so I don't expect a drop lower than that without some devastating news. It closed near 30.5 today and didn't go much lower for long, good sign. Here's why the prediction. When Trump tweeted something recently about meeting Xi it went above 32. This shows trade concerns weigh heavily on AMD, and chips in general. The FED just gave their rate plan and the markets will begin pricing in a 100% chance of a rate cut in July. This pricing in should affect whole market tomorrow, but maybe moreso on China related stocks. The rate cuts are largely to counter damage done by Trumps trade war. Damage that would be done to AMD and other chip stocks. Since the damage will be mitigated without a shadow of a doubt now, I see a rise incoming for AMD closer to the post Trump tweet about meeting with Xi, which should be around 32, but small chance of higher. \n\nSo get AMD calls at open if no gap up. I got them at end of day today, and throught as it dipped. Good luck all. As a warninf, my confidence level on this prediction is not nearly as high as my previous predictions (which were 100% confidence), but I still believe in it.", 'label': -1}, {'text': 'ALL IN ON SPY 293 CALLS NOWHURRY BEFORE THE FED ANNOUNCES RATE CUT IN JULY 25 MINUTES!!!!', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Who else bought SPY calls prior to fed announcement yesterday?

I want to caution being greedy at a time like this. Small wins will always profit, but getting greedy almost never pays.

You can see that we\'re in new territory and SPY is establishing new support/resistance lines. So if SPY pulls back, wait and see how SPY does at those lines. (Please add an "ish" to the end of those three numbers on the chart. For example, 297.20ish). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome thoughts: \n\n**1) Don\'t call the top and buy puts like a dumb auti until SPY falls back into the shaded box, imo. \\*\\*295\\*\\* The trend is UP right now, people!** If SPY drops below 295, you might try puts because the fall may accelerate. Otherwise, if you\'re buying puts, (presumably) you\'re just trying to make money on scalping technical pullbacks (which is difficult but legit and what we all try to do every day (think of ROKU all year). \n\nNote: **for SPX,** the main key battle line is 2954, imo. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hsCuGL3f/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hsCuGL3f/)\n\nUnlike many others, I am not of the view that SPY 234 must be retested. \n\n**2) IWM.** SPY and QQQ have been making new ATH\'s in this raging bull market. Why is IWM lagging so hard? I think it is because small caps are more dependent on debt, and so until there is an OFFICIAL rate cut announced, IWM will lag. But it\'s gonna fucking FLY when/if a rate cut is officially announced. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hLQfGz0v/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hLQfGz0v/)\n\nThe absolute key number for IWM is 160. If it breaks 160 into 161, it will FLY FLY FLY (imo).\n\n **3) AAPL:**  Think of a ticker that hasn\'t reached a new ATH yet in this raging bull market....

But unlike companies that invest in infrastructure and equipment, if Netflix wants to stay relevant, it must continue to do these things. It would be decades before Netflix has enough original content to get rid of the other stuff, and I’m not convinced it would be as popular without it.\n\nIn addition, do we really see massive growth from here? It seems that most people who want Netflix have Netflix, hence the drop in domestic growth, and that it just doesn’t have the same appeal internationally (hence the disappointing numbers). If you travel, you know that nobody consumes streaming TV like Americans. We will never see comparable adoption abroad. \n\nSo, I ask, why is this stock so expensive?

Intel, AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia all subtract their absolutely massive R&amp;D expenditures from their equally massive gross margins (AMD\'s margins were unsustainable bad at less than 40%, Intel is doing well at better than 50%), but their earnings are nowhere near that high because the EPS already has the R&amp;D subtracted out.\n\nSemiconductor companies cannot survive on their back catalogs, and massive R&amp;D spending is an ongoing necessity.

His shareholders are the people most likely to grab his attention. Yesterday, ya boy (me) bought two calls that expire next week—therefore I am a shareholder and Elon will care about me...then I can influence him.\n\nI have compiled a comprehensive list of multiple-pointed plans that can help us influence Elon Musk to give us some tendies. You need to understand that Elon is like a reverse vending machine that gives you money, and right now he’s just broken—so we need to influence him and get back to getting tendies.\n\n**Plan A:** Get him to call someone a pedophile on Twitter. Simple, yet effective. Just tweet him a question about Jeffery Epstein and sit back and watch. (Chance of success: 88% // Estimated price movement: $56)\n\n**Plan B:** Find him in person and ask him to buy shares of TSLA. Elon is a great guy, he cares about us. So when you see him, sit down and have an intimate conversation with him. Ask him to buy a few million shares. Gently rub his thigh. If worse comes to worse, he might just hand some cash and tell you to find a motel for the night. Best case scenario, he hands you cash for a motel, and then tweets about how you might be a pedophile. (Chance I’d success: 100% // Estimated price movement: $51)\n\n**Plan C:** Ask Elon to print Beyond Meat out of the TSLA CD trays. Nobody uses CDs anymore, creating new forms of mass and printing food out of it is the new rave. Turn those CD trays into chemically grown meat buffets. May not work if Tesla’s do not have CD trays, but maybe an external part that can connect via Bluetooth or USB would work. Coin flip Chance at success, but massive gainz. (Chance of success: 50% // Estimated price movement: $600+)\n\n**Plan D:** Convert Teslas to run off of coal. The president is a massive supporter of coal, and we have all this coal laying around that nobody uses anymore—maybe daddy Elon should use it to run his cars. No more charging stations, no more coal plants closing. The president will definitely make this a law if we tweet some solid memes at him. (Chance of success: 71% // Estimated price movement: $12)\n\n**Plan E:** Drug Elon and video tape it. This worked for Joe Rogan when he was a desperate bagholder. Now he owned a Tesla—think about that. TSLA price skyrocketed out of sheer pity for Elon after seeing him drugged like that. Better drugs may yield better results. Nobody really knows. (Chance of success: 100% // Estimated price movement: $90)\n\nAny one of these will bring us the tendies back. Elon cares about all of us shareholders.

But due to the state of play elsewhere in the world we were melting upwards. There needed to be a catalyst either way for the market to definitively pick a direction, i fear we may have found it, and it says down. \n\nNow i fully expect that since i’m making this post therefor jinxing myself and mr. market will hear me and do the opposite. But fuck it. \n\nI called the hourly H&amp;S reversal a couple days ago and here are my price targets:\n\nBest possible scenarios for the bulls: \n\nwe stop right about here on the short term trend line/50 period moving average on the daily and reverse and back to our regular scheduled programing. That would be around a 3% decline from the highs of this week. \n\nMost likely/neutral scenario: \n\nwe mill around a bit at this price level ultimately breaking the short term trend line/relative support around $291.50 - $290.50 and then ultimately my price target would be somewhere around the low of the May dip @ $275ish give or take. But keep in mind that it looks like that would be creating the head of a much larger H&amp;S pattern if we bounce back up from there. The H&amp;S pattern would be negated if we reach back up to the $301 price level, and if that happens my price target is around $304. If this plays out it’s be a 8-9% decline from the highs. \n\nBest case for the bears scenario: \n\nwe break through the major support at $275ish and then my next price target would be around the $250 price range. Keep in mind this is still a relatively bullish analysis as some chartists are calling for a ~30% drop. I’m not sold on this being it though. If we do hit that long term trend line at around $250 and it holds expect us to rip to new highs by EOY. If it breaks, buy gold, run for cover and try not to check your portfolio. If this plays out and trend line holds it’d be about a 15% decline from the highs. \n\nAs i got rekt on AMZN and AMD earnings i’m really just holding onto the seat of my pants with a couple OTM puts and a fat silver play but these are my price targets.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'SPY down and suddenly the sub is all bears.

They already have the customer base using their devices. I am sure they will make it easier or enticing to get the card.\n\nOne of the key aspect of the card is that Apple can use that data to market better services. (Part of the agreement of the card). That means competing with companies like yelp etc - based on your spending habits Apple can target advertise - you are where you spend your money, great marketing. \n\nOf course the other business growth can be tied to these services.

Once Yang is in office, it shouldn\'t take him more than a day to get the Freedom Dividend out to people and change all those pesky laws keeping tech companies down. Tesla does over the air updates, so it won\'t take long at all until everyone driving a Tesla has a sweet robo-chauffeur to do their bidding. \n\nOnce all Teslas are fully self driving, everyone will want to buy shares of the company.

Unless Trump regains his true bull self, expect SPY to continue it's downtrend for the week considering there has been literally zero positive political or economic news this week. In other words, the stock market is ON FUCKING FIRE. \n\nAs for October 2nd, look for $SPY  to rally at open. If it breaks 294.25 early, expect a flat-to-mildly green day, before a big drop the rest of the week. On the opposite side, if we break through 293.00 on the downside, expect all hell to break loose and $SPY to close around 290. \n\nIn conclusion, barring Tariff man going full Bull Gang, expect another red day tomorrow because there is absolutely no fucking reason for a green day at all.

Model Y crossover will be available in North America in the summer of 2020 and should be a relatively easy production ramp considering the carryover of Model 3 components and production lines. Crossovers are a huge segment and this vehicle should have plenty of orders, increasing demand well past the current \\~400k/year production rate and closer to the higher rate they should be capable of at the end of 2020.

Let\'s ask: what is a probable valuation of Tesla if things go very well? Let’s imagine this future: By the end of 2020, they are approaching a million cars per year run rate. Model Y production ramp went well and they’re slowly taking over the huge global crossover market. Cars are flying out of the China factory at impressive gross margins.

Their GOOG stock is a Pyramid scheme.GOOG is a C class stock without voting rights and it doesn’t pay dividends, and they said that they will not pay them in the future. The company explicitly said in its 2017 annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that "we intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future." Google states the "par value” (the amount Google owes you for the stock) of each GOOG stock is 0.001$ US Dollars. Yet each stock is sold at 1700$ in the stock market.\n\nWhy does one buy a GOOG stock? To make money. But since GOOG doesn’t pay dividends, the only way to make money is by selling it to other investor at a higher price. But that investor is buying that stock from the first to also make money, by selling it to others at a higher price. And if everyone is buying GOOG stock to sell it to someone else at a higher price, then what real value GOOG stocks have?\n\nIf you come to Alphabet Inc, and show them your 1700$ stock and told them to repay it, they will pay you 0.001$ US Dollars.\n\nSo the only way you can make money, is by taking money generated by new investors.\n\nDefinition of a Ponzi Scheme: “A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. Ponzi schemes eventually bottom out when the flood of new investors dries up and there isn\'t enough money to go around. At that point, the schemes unravel.” So if GOOG is a ponzi scheme, when do investors dry up and the scheme is unraveled like other Ponzi schemes? The unraveling gets hidden, because It is masked as a bubble burst.\n\nWhen the new investors stop buying stocks, last investors holding that stock cannot sell them at a higher price and the price of the stock crushes, we call it a bubble burst.\n\nIf GOOG doesn’t give any money to its investors, and only source of money for investors are new investors, than it’s a zero sum game. Like a gambling game with other people, but with fees attached to be able to play at a casino, in this case Google.\n\nBut it isn’t advertised as a gambling, GOOG is advertised as an investment by Alphabet, making clueless investors buy GOOG stocks, not knowing that its just a zero sum gambling. This is at the edge of criminality. I don’t even know how is it legal.\n\nThe simple truth is, GOOG is a Ponzi scheme, being advertised as an investment, when in reality it’s a zero-sum gambling game where the winners are those who sell them first before others, and if everyone knew that it was a zero sum gambling, GOOG stock price would crush right now and no one would want to buy it anymore.

I have no positions long or short in Tesla (not like this post fucking matters). \n\nSource:[The Reasonable Formation of Unreasonable Things](https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/Collaborative%20Fund%20Bubbles.pdf)\n\nThere is a distinct difference between volatility and things getting completely out of hand.\n\nStocks fell 19% in the summer of 2011, and quickly recovered. That’s volatility. The Nasdaq fell 80% after 2000, and didn’t recover for a decade. That’s something else.\n\nBut the fact that markets spread from volatile to utterly out of control -- like a bubble -- makes sense. Rational sense. It makes so much sense that we should expect it to keep happening.\n\nOne of the biggest flaws to come out of academic finance is the idea that assets have one rational price in a world where investors have different goals and time horizons.\n\nAsk yourself: How much should you have paid for Yahoo! stock in 1999? The answer depends on who “you” are.\n\nIf you have a 30-year time horizon, the smart price to pay was a sober analysis of Yahoo!’s discounted cash flows over the subsequent 30-years.\n\nIf you have a 10-year time horizon, it’s some analysis about the industry’s potential over the next decade and whether management could execute on its vision.\nIf you have a 1-year time horizon, it’s an analysis of current product sales cycles and whether we’ll have a bear market.\n\nIf you’re a daytrader, the smart price to pay is “who the hell cares?,” because you’re just trying to squeeze a few basis points out of whatever happens between now and lunchtime, which can be accomplished at any price.\n\nWhen investors have different goals and time horizons -- and they do in every asset class -- prices that look ridiculous for one person make sense to another, because the factors worth paying attention to are totally different.\n\nPeople can look at Yahoo! stock in 1999 and say “This is crazy! A zillion times reve- nue! This valuation makes no sense!”\n\nBut many investors who owned Yahoo! stock in 1999 had time horizons so short that it made sense for them to pay a ridiculous price.\n\nA daytrader could accomplish what they need whether Yahoo! was at $5 a share or $500 a share, as long as it moved in the right direction. Which it did, for years.\n\nMoney chases returns. Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term.\n\nThat process feeds on itself. As traders push up short-term returns, they attract more traders. Before long -- and it really doesn’t take long -- the dominant price-setters with the most authority are those with ever-shortening time horizons.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'TSLA bubble pop', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'RIP to all TSLA top buyers who may have perished today.

(APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you\'ve been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. \n\n- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD\'s CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). \n\n- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia\'s RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they\'re up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it\'s not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. \n\n- AMD\'s next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD\'s previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer\'s like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). \n\n**RISK FACTORS**\n\n- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD\'s own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: ["...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market."](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)\n\n- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).\n[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)\n\n- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn\'t really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here\'s%20why&amp;text=Apple\'s%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.)

AMD is still Apple\'s partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you\'ll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let\'s break it down by company.\n\n - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company’s Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&amp;text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft\'s laptops run on AMD hardware. \n\n - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.)

Sony has had to increase production by 50%!\n\n* TSM are trying to build new fabs asap to increase production of CPU's - Today they reported a 23% increase in profits.\n\n* PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade.\n \n* The gaming PC market is set to grow 25% by 2024\n\n* Intel's competitive advantage (their own fabs) is so useless that they are trying to buy space at the already full TSM fab. \n\n* Intel are 2-3 years behind AMD. \n\n* r/intel = 205,452 users, r/amd = 765,440 (hmmmmmm)\n\n* Lisa Su always delivers the promised numbers every quarter \n\nOh yeah, and mad lad **CRAMER** [just told everyone to load up during this buying opportunity.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/intel-shakeup-creates-buying-opportunity-in-amd-jim-cramer-says.html)\n\nRight now the boomers who don't understand the PC market are shorting AMD and buying up Intel just because it's the only name the recognise from the dinosaur age.

Much of this was due to Intel\'s appointment of a new CEO as the market viewed this leadership change as a negative to AMD\'s stock price. BMO capital downgraded AMD\'s price and the stock fell nearly 10% in a week. \n\nIf you weren\'t retarded, you took this drop as a buying opportunity, as earnings day is coming next Tuesday (1/26/2020). With AMD poised to shit on earning expectations, AMD is looking to runup on the days before earnings. The high anticipation of a strong 4th quarter combined with the high IV will drive up premium prices, as the releases of the new consoles that utilize AMD PS5 and XBOX series X were smashing hits. Additionally, when you take in that PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade, and that the notebook market share is growing by 50%, the demand for AMD has never been higher. \n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/20/amd-is-hammering-intel-in-this-critical-area/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/20/amd-is-hammering-intel-in-this-critical-area/)\n\n"Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann expects AMD\'s CPU market share to jump to 50%\xa0in 2021.

I have literally never seen this before, and honestly I didn't know it was legal for MM to not offer any bids or asks at all.\n\nI've also been wondering why Citadel bailed out Melvin. What is their relationship? Well see, Citadel is one of the largest market makers in the US. They are the ones that sell us the options that let us weaponize degen and yolo into riches that we promptly burn up. Citadel also holds a large short position, so presumably they bailed out Melvin because they did not want to start a liquidity cascade that was gonna eat them alive too.\n\nQuestions I've been wondering and I think I have a theory for\n\n1. Melvin was supposed to go BK at GME 175. They claimed they exited their short. What happened?\n2.

Who wrote those?\n3. How did GME get naked shorted when only Market Makers are allowed to naked short?\n\nI suspect that Melvin did go BK today. They got acquired by Citadel. They bought those put options from Citadel and Citadel has held the naked short position all these years. Risk management at these market maker desks will absolutely pull a bid and not offer if they think they are at risk of blowing up the firm. IMO Citadel market maker desk didn't trade shit the first 15 minutes of the day because they were trying to figure out what the fuck to do. I don't know if they made a last minute deal this morning or pulled capital together or what but they are on their fucking last leg.\n\nLook at Melvins long positions, a lot of them fucking sold off heavy early today. PINS. PYPL. JD. NFLX. IMO options were not traded by Citadel during first 15 minutes today while they sold off what they needed from Melvin to maintain liquidity.\n\nI made this post a few weeks ago about why market indices are at a risk this week and last week if we see any red.

But those **bearish positions probably aren’t big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds**.\n\nThat’s the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market’s capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**\n\nWhether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week’s selling -- the worst in the S&amp;P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they’re unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.\n\n “We’re witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don’t have an outsize influence**,” said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. “**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.”\n\nBurned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.\n\nWhile the **S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**. To JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a “short-lived technical tumble.” With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.\n\n To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Keep holding GME (if you like the stock).\n\nMore details in the full text of the below Bloomberg article for the few of you whose attention span exceeds 10 seconds. I **bolded** the important parts.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-31/gamestop-short-nightmare-shows-few-signs-of-becoming-a-contagion?sref=2CO9MdgW](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-31/gamestop-short-nightmare-shows-few-signs-of-becoming-a-contagion?sref=2CO9MdgW)\n\n# GameStop Short Nightmare Shows Few Signs of Becoming a Contagion\n\n[GameStop Corp.’s](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US) surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent. But those **bearish positions probably aren’t big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds**.\n\nThat’s the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market’s capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**\n\nWhether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week’s selling -- the worst in the S&amp;P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they’re unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.\n\n “We’re witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don’t have an outsize influence**,” said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. “**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.”\n\nBurned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.\n\nWhile the **S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**. To JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a “short-lived technical tumble.” With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.\n\n To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020’s pandemic market.\n\n“Although the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,” Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop’s ticker. “While we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.”\n\nBy Barclays’s tally, **short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves**.

I'm usually over at /r/AMD_stock posting DD there. But I'm posting here because the recent activity in the stock led me to realize a huge, glaring problem with the stock's performance and it's latest earnings.\n\nLet me step back a bit first.\n\nLast Friday the stock plummeted 12% after posting the best earnings it possibly could have posted. At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down.

Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. \n\nWhat more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that? You could even see the [bewilderment](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/27/full-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-on-q4-results-product-pipeline-demand-and-more.html) on Lisa Su's face as she started an interview with CNBC the morning after.\n\nWhy?

It's you.\n\nYou buy the cheapest AMD weeklies you can and hold them through earnings like it can't go tits up. You hope that AMD beats all expectations, and that the stock price skyrockets on your tendie-train choo-choo-ing to the moon. Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!\n\nThe day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.\n\nStop losing at AMD!

I have been posting on this sub for over 3 years back when we were at only a couple hundred thousand. This is my first DD write up and I’m a little retarded so please go easy on me. \n\nFor everyone who doesn’t want to read a wall of text there’s a **TL:DR** at the bottom.\n\n**Technical Setup:**\n\nCanoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capital’s retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you haven’t been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out. \n\n[S3 short Info](https://imgur.com/RPVpzbu)\n\n[NASDAQ Short Info](https://imgur.com/LrjJJCD)\n\n[Share Borrow &amp; Fees](https://imgur.com/esZFBfL)\n\n**Fundamental Setup:**\n\nGOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.\n\n[MPDV Purpose Built Vehicle](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) \n\nCanoo’s leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 &amp; i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. \n\nThe real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that’s not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car… the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn’t take a genius to connect these dots. \n\n[i3 article Link](https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-innovation/apple-bmw-i3-electric-car-173344/amp)\n \n**My position:**\n\nI am holding shares as well as options. I recommend shares as it is the safer bet. We all know how long hedge-funds can hold a stock down for and burn your theta. \n\n[My Position](https://imgur.com/l8ir7rJ) \n \n\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n1.

No, read/watch everything you can to learn. \n- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. \n- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don’t give financial advice.

However, let me re-introduce you to a real stock: **AMD**. 🚀🚀\n\nAt $88 a share, we’re looking at massive upside. And instead of buying GME at $83, why not buy something that actually has some long term value? Oh and did I mention it’s one of the most shorted stocks this month? [https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks)\n\n**That’s $6.7 billion in short interest.** That’s larger than the actual current market cap of GME. Let’s actually make a dent here. These fuckers **added 17% more shorted shares** in the last month. You're gonna tell me their diamond hands are better than OUR DIAMOND HANDS 💎💎💎?\n\nAs our savior Elon Tweeted today : “I am become meme, destroyer of shorts.”\n\n[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993)\n\nLet’s make him proud.\n\nOk, now for some DD so you guys know I’m not talking out of my ass.\n\n# Fundamentals:\n\nTheir latest ER:\n\n**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**\n\n**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**\n\nServer revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible because that means they are actually going toe to toe with the big boys like IBM.\n\nMassive increase in guidance. They’re **expecting 37% growth** this year.\n\nSo why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let’s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.\n\nObviously, we’d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you’re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, “hey we have too many orders and we can’t keep up sorry, we’ll get it to you ASAP”\n\nImagine thinking this company isn’t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.\n\nOur queen, Lisa Su, said “there will be added capacity” in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they’ll be good to go. I wouldn’t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.\n\n**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**\n\nIntel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!\n\n**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.\n\n**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.\n\n# Technicals:\n\nFor those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.\n\nWe really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we’re basically there right now.\n\nIn addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47\n\nFor more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.\n\n# Conclusion/TLDR:\n\nMy point is that more than half of you fuckers run AMD in your machine anyway and the other half is waiting for their stimulus check to buy the new Ryzen series. The new investors here are all sad from GME, but now it’s time to put your big boy pants on and get into something that has some real value behind it. You got questions?

There are two basic reasons for my view on this.\n\n1. Fundamental points:\n   1. Strong earnings reports over the past 3 quarters.\n   2. Despite strong earnings, no real price spike. Been hovering between 80-90.\n2. Technical points:\n   1. The stock cross the 9-day moving average on 2/8/2021\n   2. The stock formed a golden cross on 2/8/2021. This is very important because this stock has tried to form a golden cross 2 times previously and failed to do so within the past few weeks. However, this time it has formed the cross and it\'s continuing to go.\n   3. RSI is continuing to trend up, indicating there is still gas for positive price action.\n   4. Crossed 50 day moving average on 2/10/2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Top is price action on 9-day. Middle is MACD. Bottom is RSI.

On the technical side, we can see that it\'s starting to go up.\n\nOverall, the 9th would have really been a good time to enter the trade because most of the elevating factors had already formed. And now with the futures up it\'s likely going to open up a lot higher, but still I see room to go up.\n\n**The exit strategy:**\n\nIf you do decide to enter this trade, and it does become profitable for you, here is how you can look to get out.\n\n1. On the MACD, when the **green bar goes from a dark green to a light green just sell the stock.** The simple view is this: dark green means strong bullish, light green means it\'s reversing to bearish. Dark red means bearish. Light red means reversing to bullish. Obviously this is overly simplified and subject to exceptions - but it\'s the general rule and if you know it you\'re better off than if you don\'t know anything at all.\n2. If you want to stay in longer (because obviously none of this is guaranteed) you can wait until the price moves close to the 9-day moving average. Once it moves under that then I\'d take all my money off the table. \n\nI use technicals as a piece of trading stocks, but I tend to never base an entire decision on trading stocks. Charts are useful because they give me more information and help me make decisions based on what is actually happening in the market. Essentially, they prevent me from making emotional decisions and allow me to think in a cool and collected way when I trade.\n\nDo with this what you will.

Ape gang professor Flux here with another heater post. You may know me from my AT&amp;T DD post which taught you how to follow unusual options flow to make some coin, or from my Hut 8 DD post which taught you how to make money using financial arbitrage. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nToday, we’re going to be learning how to identify optimal entry and exit prices for our trades, by analyzing simple charts and spotting trends. This will be done using the chart for my favourite ticker, AMD. **To all you illiterate, paint-huffing apes who dropped outta highschool and don’t like learning, I’ve attached a TLDR at the end of the post which tells you which contracts to buy to get some free money**. Let’s get to it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Building The Foundation**\nTo begin, let’s take a look at the [AMD one day chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/X5hkIw6s/), and see if we notice anything odd, or unusual.\n\nDo you see anything in particular? Does anything jump out at you? No? [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1DzmPafE/)\n\nStill nothing? If you still don't notice anything, that’s fine, these patterns can be difficult to spot initially. [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uHY32HCB/)\n\nAs you can see from the final chart, for the past year, AMD has traded within very tight, specific ranges. I have highlighted these areas on the chart using the pink boxes. As we can tell; \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Box #1)** Starting from mid February to mid April, AMD traded within a 10$ range, between $39 and $49. It started at 49$, went down to 39$, back up to 49$, down to 40$, before once again going back up to 49$, where it then smashed through the top of our current trading range, creating a new range.\n- **Box #2)** Now, starting from mid April, going all the way until earnings in August, AMD traded within a 10$ range **again**, between $49 and $59. This range was extremely tight and pronounced, bouncing from the bottom of the channel up to the top of the channel **seven** times throughout its lifetime, before smashing through the top of the channel again.\n- **Box #3)** August through December. $74 to 87$ channel. This range was slightly messier, but still pronounced nonetheless. 6 clean bounces. Smash through the top into our new range.\n- **Box #4)** This is where our most recent range lies, with an $85 bottom and a 95$ top. We haven’t surged out of this range in either direction, so it is safe to assume we are still trading within this range. **How can we use this information to our advantage?**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Applying our Knowledge**\n\nTo summarize our findings from above, for the past year, AMD has consistently traded within a predefined range before surging higher and entering a newer, higher range. These ranges have held and contained **27 different bounces without breaking**. Only one single trade has bounced lower than a given range, but it recovered within hours. **Twenty seven times, this thesis has held true, so why the fuck would it be different on the 28th**?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, I assume most of you glue sniffers know how we can use this information to our advantage. We know that AMD trades within a tight range. We know that we are currently within the $85-$95 range. We coincidentally also happen to be sitting right at 85$. As a result, we know that it is **extremely** likely that a bounce off of $85 is going to take place.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince we know that $85 is likely a bottom, and a bounce is likely going to take place, we can enter a monthly position here and make some awesome money. Personally, I picked up some 03/19 90Cs, as well as some 04/16 95Cs. And just like that, we managed to catch the literal bottom of a trade, and have the opportunity to make some free money. We can also use our findings to know when to exit our trade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Extending our Knowledge**\n\nSince we know we are trading in a channel, we also know roughly when we can expect to exit our trades! We know that the closer we get to $95, the more likely it is that we will bounce, so we can plan accordingly! Personally, with my 90C, I will look to set a stop loss when AMD is trading around 90$, and manually sell out of the position if AMD manages to break $92/$93.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEven though I’m a perma bull, I also trade the flipside of the channel as well. If I see AMD trading at $95+, I’ll enter a short position and play the trade on the way down. In this case, I set my stops a little tighter, and keep a greater watch over the trade, since we all know that stocks always go up. Furthermore, since every single channel ended with a blow off top, I don’t want to get caught in a random blowout and have my options expire worthless. I would rather be conscientious beforehand, and manage my risks accordingly.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nAs you can tell, we can learn a lot about the price movement of a stock by simply looking at its chart. Although the AMD example was painfully simple, it’s also painfully effective. The best part about all this is, that there are dozens of opportunities like this within the market, simply waiting to be discovered. I hope you all learned something new today, and had fun while doing so. If you guys want to check out my other DDs, or follow me on my socials, they can all be found on my profile (Discord saw this DD first!). I love you all, and wish lots tendies upon each and every one of you :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TLDR**\n\n- Buy **$AMD 2021-03-19 C $90** and **$AMD 2021-04-16 C $95**\n\n---\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**2/23 Update** - AMD held $84.50 on this brutal red day, and stayed within the channel (wow! shocker!).

Coincidentally almost exactly a year ago the same nightly nosedives intraday saves started\n\nMost days aren’t actually green intraday and most money is made holding after hours/between days, and most major movements occur overnight because it’s easier to move large sums of trading hours money with smaller sums of futures/ah/pm money, and for anyone who pays very close attention to what hedges are doing you’ll usually notice a consistent strategy. They sell puts on a sharp red day (Yesterday, today’s morning), and then cause a reversal so they can buy back those puts for cheap. They do this with calls too and that was the main purpose of today’s rapid rise… \n\nIf anyone sees where this is going yet, there were a lot of calls sold and puts bought back today. Today’s opening was an example of hedges becoming afraid they lose control over their shorts, and we lost 5 dollars on SPY in 20 minutes, and the day they actually lose control will be a shorting onslaught for them.\n\nThis relates to tomorrow because they would love to buy back the calls they sold for as little as possible, and by buying back puts general losses on the market don’t hurt as much. Todays vertical rises/ falls made option volatility very high and the high volatility raised prices which need to be torn down by a huge gap down overnight into a slide tomorrow. My guess is 2-3% but could be more, no one will know till pre market tomorrow.\n\n\nHence doing the opposite of what market makers want their prey to do should increase your profits even more.

Which is why the stock is so volatile.\n\nThe high price is due to tesla historically high success at hitting 50% CARG since 2012.  Just try carrying forward 30% CARG for 10 years and see what estimates that gives you.\n\nAs such market is expecting tesla to do well.  Production is lined up for 1M autos this year to not be an unreasonable number, double of 2020.\n\nDo all the above and assign a price multiple to the revenue.\n\nSo teslas track is strong, its history is strong, and its potential is even stronger.\n\n\nSo do the math.  20M autos at 25k sale price yields 500B in revenue.  Double that to include power potential, so $1T in revenue.  30% margins leaves us with 300B in profits (assuming they can get earnings to near equal auto margins, they currently do NOT).  A 20 P/E gives us $6T market cap.  This ignores robo taxis.\n\nSo $6000 a share by 2030, assuming no robo taxi revenue, production hit targets, and 20 P/E.  Obviously a lot of risk to these targets though.\n\nAlternatively, 40% CARG (tesla has had 50% since they IPO'd) would put 2030 revenue at $896B.  Not far off from the above.\n\n\nBig questions are\n\n1) can it hit/maintain 30% margins as EVs race to the bottom on prices/commodize.  Apple has done well with phones but autos may be more difficult, idk\n\n2) can it turn revenue into profits equal to 30% profit margins.  Current earnings are no where near the declared auto profit margins. \n\n3) can it scale manufacturing fast enough to hit target with batteries being a big limitation, driven by limits in battery supply chains, which they have to take in house and reinvent to achieve \n\n4) is a 20 P/E reasonable.  If not what is?  Most autos are much less then this.  But most autos have terrible debt positions and near no growth.  \n\n5) biggest what if, can they make robo taxis a global thing?  How will that affect revenue and margins?\n\nMay be a good time to BUY THE DIP\n\n\nDisclaimer: not investment advice.  I am long shares and call since 2016.  I like the stock.

A good way to look at it is - to increase in value Tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky. For the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once, or maybe not even at all. \n\nBefore I start let me make it clear that, while I do eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner I am by no means an expert and this is hardly a *serious* DD like some others I\'ve seen here before. This is just my opinion and my take, do what you will you beautiful retards\n\nAlso - I like Tesla, and I respect them a lot. I love that they made electric cars S3XY, and I want one, but God damn if they aren\'t insanely overvalued. I\'m betting against the stock, not the company. Let\'s just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand - Tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer (+Lyft) COMBINED. I love their cars, but dude holy FUCK. You absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond. So let\'s talk why this action today is expected, natural, and IMO, only sealing Tesla\'s fate towards reality.\n\nFirst - Tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago. Elon even admitted as much [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html). While they have done extremely well since then, and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand (especially Q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 BILLION USD from $3B), this worries me more than encourages me. Why aren\'t they spending this cash on future R&amp;D efforts, paying down debt, making even more factories (yes yes India I know, but MORE), charging stations, battery tech, or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks non-stop despite Coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit (barely) their delivery targets, etc? Tesla already has mega churn because Elon/\'the culture\' burns people out, and a bonus would be super well received I\'m sure. Nope, they buy some digital currency (you know the one). Look, say what you will, Elon is a bit of a weirdo. Love him, but man if he isn\'t unusual for a Billionaire visionary, and that move was definitely weird for a large(ish) corporation to do with so much money given they\'re so young, relatively unproven (compared to other auto makers, at least in the eyes of the boomer clan) and looking to aggressively ramp up production. To me, it shows they don\'t have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash, so they\'d rather drive traffic to sales via, well, a meme. That might be a genius move, but it\'s definitely non-standard and doesn\'t speak to confidence in new development coming easily. This means, at least to me, with Tesla, what you see is what you get. They don\'t have any huge surprises coming, or new products lurking that we haven\'t already heard about (robotaxi lol, $25k car, etc). They don\'t have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out, and they aren\'t aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead. Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, etc all have EVs on market this year, and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing EV demand. They\'re behind, but not for long. They may be slow giants, but they didn\'t get there for free, and they have been there that long for a reason. Finally, EV is the future for now, but what if in five years it\'s hydrogen, or fucking fusion, or maybe even some bad stuff happens with EV and everyone wants ICE again - Tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once - might make them slower, but it\'s also less risk, and they\'re not THAT slow seeing as they\'re already on the market. It is legitimately retarded to count those auto-makers out. At that point just roll your 401k into Robinhood.\n\nSecond - let\'s talk Tesla fundamentals (ish). I\'m not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because I am a moron and I don\'t know how. What I am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers. Here is what Tesla (currently) sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from: Cars (duh), Solar roof/Solar wall, Robotaxis eventually, Insurance eventually, Semis eventually. People like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be (maybe, maybe not, time will tell), and I\'ll talk about that in a second. \nCars, duh, Teslas are dope as hell. They have had their issues in the past, but they\'re sick and people want them. Demand is there for sure and growing rapidly, I won\'t deny. BUT, others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards EV. Meaning, when the old, crusty ass MFs who don\'t know "What\'s an electricity" decide they want an EV, they will have SIGNIFICANTLY more choice as consumers than you or I today if we were to go car shopping. This will, undoubtedly, pull away from Tesla sales. You can assume that Tesla somehow magically doesn\'t lose any interest in a field with increasing competition, but this just isn\'t reality. People like new things, and companies that make new good cars will see sales. Tesla is that right now, will they be that in the future? I\'m not certain. See production scaling concerns above. To really assume they won\'t lose any consumer interest despite growing competition, they\'d need to be pumping out multiple different models. I\'m talking a non "cyber" Tesla truck, some sort of hatchback/sport crossover, maybe even an \'adventure sport\' rig like an EV 4 Runner or the EV Hummer that\'s coming out. Americans like big cars, it\'s a fact. Just because it\'s an EV and saving the planet doesn\'t mean consumers want to sacrifice - this is why Tesla was and has been successful, because they finally made an EV that wasn\'t fugly as shit and a laughing stock, but if they don\'t continue to drive innovation into existing ICE sectors with EV tech, they\'re going to get left behind. Tesla is gonna want to capture this market share, and they haven\'t even hinted at it so far. I don\'t know specific numbers, and I don\'t think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt, but Tesla isn\'t going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future EV sphere unless they really buck up. If anything, by not doing these things now, they\'re backing themselves into a corner and a specific \'look\' that might be hard to shake later.\nNext: solar things. Solar wall and roof are dope, but they\'re not cheap, and pretty niche right now. It requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place. There\'s also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now. We *could* see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy, in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable, but it\'s still a matter of scale. I don\'t know their production numbers but with how little I\'ve heard about it, I don\'t think they\'re huge, and if demand spikes, they won\'t be in a great place to capture it if they aren\'t scaling appropriately (see cash concerns above). \nNow let\'s talk Robotaxis and Insurance. Insurance is a dud, that\'s not big money. Maybe I\'m not just a retard, but also an idiot, but I truly don\'t think Tesla offering insurance does ANYTHING positive for their bottom line. The way I understand the proposition is that because they\'re so confident in their self-driving tech they would become your insurance company, insuring you if FSD made any mistakes. This is a lot of liability forrrr nothing. They can\'t really take payments for it, unless it\'s well below what consumers pay now for insurance, otherwise are they really so confident about their tech? If that\'s the case, insurers will drop rates and lay off employees/close locations to meet those rates because a) they like money and b) it\'s even easier money than now if they\'re less likely to pay out. At a certain point, Tesla\'s "insurance" is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for Tesla. They take on a lot of risk, and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isn\'t too high (AND after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this), otherwise they\'re taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain. Robotaxis are equally dud-ish. Again, maybe I\'m just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people. Even though people bitch about other people, everyone bitched about being inside/away from society during Rona and never seeing anyone. Some people like those random interactions you get with a real person, and some people just truly don\'t trust robots. Both of these take away from potential customers/market share Tesla is likely to see from Robotaxis. Also old people and tech don\'t generally mix. Getting better, but still, old people and robots likely won\'t be a hot seller. Further, regulation and the required insurance/warranty/coverage whatever for this whole operation won\'t be quick or cheap. What happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out (asleep or faints) in your Robotaxi? What happens if it does happen to get in an accident, or if it gets a flat tire? What happens if the address is wrong, or someone needs to change where they\'re going? What if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesn\'t respond, or what if they aren\'t a native speaker or are disabled (mute, deaf, blind, need assistance getting into trunk or into/out of car)? How do these situations get handled? Finally - not everyone wants to have random people in their car, especially without supervision. What if someone trashes your car? Or pisses/shits/pukes in there while they\'re drunk? Sure Tesla or whoever might cover you, but Robotaxis won\'t clean themselves. Further - what about charging? The cars won\'t charge themselves after they\'re done with their \'shift\', so unless you\'re able to go out and plug it in, what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home? Guess you gotta wait. Not saying it\'s impossible, just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk. And here\'s the kicker - it\'s not even a super profitable industry. Uber is operating at a loss and they\'re the defacto millennial ride calling service. Lyft and Yellow Cab still exist, among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like Asia. Europe is much more walkable IMO so it\'s not *as* popular from what I\'ve seen, but in major cities (London) sure it still is. Overall Robotaxis aren\'t really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for Tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots. Plus, if everyone has a Tesla, who the fuck is riding in the Robotaxis? Even if you assume somehow Tesla starts being like USPS or Amazon and delivering packages/groceries/becomes a god damn short bus, there still will be competitors and it\'s still not as easy as saying \'but it\'s the fUtuRe\'.\nSemis - I don\'t know shit about shit here, but I haven\'t heard much more than a peep about this, so I\'m naively assuming it\'s not a huge corner of Tesla\'s business projections for the future. Maybe Tesla becomes the Daimler of EV and sells only big ass EV Semis, but I doubt it. I don\'t see this being a huge money maker, perhaps I\'m very wrong.\nLastly batteries - lots of people like to say how Tesla\'s batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors, blah blah, but I don\'t really buy this. Their tech may be really good now, but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming HARD for the money in the EV sphere. I don\'t want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech - but SOMEONE will. People like money, a lot. If these companies don\'t figure out how to build their own batteries like Tesla, someone will. And here is where Tesla\'s battery strategy becomes not super useful - Tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries - if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to Tesla\'s, they will likely end up a lot cheaper (eventually, not immediately) because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other EV makers, (standardizing in the process no less) not just the batteries Tesla needs. And if that never happens, it means the EV makers made their own, which means they are confident enough in their own cost/performance/etc, and Tesla really isn\'t that far ahead. I know Tesla has a big advantage here now, but that doesn\'t mean people who worked on Tesla batteries won\'t go work elsewhere for more money, and it doesn\'t mean these other companies won\'t hire young and hungry Masters and PhD grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to Yale. In fact, that tech is probably already being developed in Ivy League labs for fun by those exact types of people for their PhD and Professors using their grant and research money, hell some boy scout in a garage in Iowa might be doing it right now. Tesla may be a leader now, counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid. Everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $1500+ is either completely braindead, irretrievably stupid, or not paying any attention whatsoever. They\'re assuming Tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and they\'re the golden child forever. Look, I like Tesla, but no matter what endeavor they go after, someone else is gonna go for it too. Tesla may end up being better at it, but that doesn\'t make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesn\'t mean everyone will use Tesla\'s stuff. Some people don\'t like the brand, some people don\'t like Elon, others may just like other stuff more. \n\nFinally, look at the "anatomy of a bubble" and compare it to Tesla\'s stock chart. It\'s shockingly similar. I know, I know, that\'s moronic, but I\'m a moron and a 🌈🐻 so what can I say. The other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is Radio Corporation of America circa 1930. Radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the FUCKIN FUTURE dude. So shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie, turns out radio wasn\'t the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be, and stock prices tanked. This has happened with every bubble, ever. Everyone thinks they\'re invincible, everyone thinks this time is different, everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong, ever (Cathie Wood ähem ähem), but every. single. time. they\'ve been proven wrong. Fundamentals always matter, and Tesla ain\'t there chief. Finally - Graham, Dodd, Buffet, some of the most legendary investors/investing advice people EVER whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions, warn about \'buying at any price, assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in you\'ll make money\'. This sound familiar? How about those ludicrous price targets of $1600/share? Sound reasonable? Unless Tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole (and I don\'t just mean ICE to EV retards), their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked.\n\nThere\'s a few catalysts that I can think of as well - some bearish, some bullish. \nFor some bullish ones: UK announced Uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors, meaning their profits will be hurt. This does mean good news for Robotaxis, if and only if they can actually make them work profitably. Further, "loos-id" (don\'t think I can say this name here) is going public and Rivian is slated to go public this year as well. If these companies, or NKLA, or NIO or some other companies have significant and public blunders, Tesla stands to gain. \nHowever - some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they DONT fuck up, they\'re just more competition in an increasingly crowded space. More choices means less profits for Tesla. Also, in case you guys forgot, Tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights. They don\'t offer 401ks and they have been staunchly anti-union. Further, Elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders, and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home. He might not have been directly involved in this, but Tesla sure was. While those have already eclipsed, it isn\'t a promising outlook for the future, and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout. I\'m not saying they\'re gonna miss targets, but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strike/rebel and want more representation/compensation/work life balance. This would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins. Further, with a democratic party leading all branches, and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions, companies like Amazon and Tesla that don\'t treat workers well may see legal/punitive backlash from the government if they don\'t change things themselves. I for one would be *popcorn meme* watching AOC and Elon duke it out on twitter over something like this. Also, Tesla is opening a new factory in India and there are factories in China, but these might not be as great as people think. India is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there, along with China and the Uighurs. I would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues, which could spell bad news for Tesla. These countries are great new markets, but like the USA, they also have their own car manufacturers and other EV players - Tesla isn\'t going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out.\n\nSo all of this paints my pretty grim picture for Tesla\'s stock price, but here\'s where I do my retard math. If you look at Yahoo finance for Tesla\'s book value, you get like $20/share. This takes into account all of Tesla\'s assets and liabilities. Now Tesla could take on more liabilities/debt in order to fund more R&amp;D and drop their book value by doing so, but here\'s the thing - they have like $16B cash on deck to do that, and they haven\'t. I don\'t see them taking out massive loans that haven\'t been \'normal business procedure\' for them in the coming year(s). So, take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50% year over year for 5 years straight (which would be fucking insane). This gives you like $154/share Book value. Now, let\'s look at their peers and their sector. EV as a whole is in a bubble IMO so I don\'t think it\'s really legitimate to compare to their EV peers (EV is the tech bubble, Tesla is the specific \'stock issue\' in question affected most heavily because of name/brand recognition). So, compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or I have been alive (Toyota, VW, BMW, Honda, Daimler, Suzuki, Ford, GM) the average price to book ratio of those companies is 1.16. Tesla\'s is 35.25. If you take the insane growth figure I listed before (which represents 50% YoY TRUE growth in the company - averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value) AND you add on a 125% INCREASE of the P/B ratio (so 225% raw) compared to their peers (this assumes they\'re 125% more pricey than their closest competitors, after insane growth for the next five years, meaning we\'re assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for Tesla) and you price all of that in TODAY you get a value of $401/share. Tesla is almost double that today. \n\nIn my opinion, Tesla\'s true value lies around $100/share. With an assumption of 20% YoY growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50% increase of P/B relative to peer average (Tesla is the P/B sector leader with this factor added on), you get $75/share. If you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better, call it $100 or $150. This \'book value\' (and its growth expectation) wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of Tesla bulls like to point to saying how Tesla is supreme and much better than companies like Toyota which literally fucking created \'Lean Manufacturing\' (it\'s called "the Toyota way") that transformed not just auto manufacturing, but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general. Put up against that, Tesla may be a maverick, but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition. Anything more than $200/share and I think you\'re truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history. \n\nSo where does that leave us, today? Well, Michael Burry, despite being pretty crazy, is actually pretty brilliant, and has been skeptical/short on Tesla long before I decided to jack myself to the tits (quantity wise, not so much cost) on cheap premie puts. I don\'t think anyone can truly time a bubble, and the actions that the Fed has been taking, along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any \'top\' well beyond its natural range. I could get totally fucked because of this but whatever, I didn\'t throw in more than I can afford to lose so whatever happens, happens, plus as a 🌈🐻 I\'d probably deserve it anyways. The selloff that has happened over the past week I believe is the start of the \'blowoff\' phase. We\'re on the way down now, it\'s just a matter of how long it can hang on, IMO. The big dip yesterday was our \'local bottom\' until we ramp back up to the \'back to normal\' section. If you\'re long Tesla, personally, I\'d sell there. I do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two. I\'m not an expert but I\'m guessing in about a week or two we\'re back up near $800-820 and that\'ll be about the peak. After that, I think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level, wherever that ends up being (between $90 and $1600 if you listen to analysts, really insightful shit, really narrows it down). The bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to, and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals. I might be wrong about the timing, but I\'m as close to certain as I\'ve ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $200 levels in the next year. If I\'m right, I\'m buying a Tesla.\n\nPositions - lots of 3/19 puts at different sub $300 strikes. Planning on buying more cheap OTM short term puts every month until this stock goes down or I go bankrupt. Sadly was a greedy fuck and didn\'t sell one 2/26 $590p during the big dip yesterday\n\nFeel free to call me a 🌈🐻 in the comments ☺️💋', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Alright boys, who’s making the next 7 TSLA memes?', 'label': -1}, {'text': '10k to 40k in 3 days, TSLA puts/calls and SPY puts/calls', 'label': -1}, {'text': '10k to 40k in 3 days, TSLA puts/calls and SPY puts/calls', 'label': -1}, {'text': '$AMD $TSM $SMH 🚀🚀🚀🚀 after hours', 'label': -1}, {'text': "Should I sell $TSLA after yesterday's crash?", 'label': -1}, {'text': 'First post: TSLA 🚀🚀🚀', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Nvidia Reports Earnings Today!

That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.\n\nAs many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important. \n\nSo what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.\n\nThe reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.\n\nOver the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.\n\nAlso, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!\n\nThis is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.\n\nCalls were cheap on Friday so I bought 170 BRK.B $242.50C 3/5/21. $50K YOLO on the Oracle of Omaha.", 'label': 1}, {'text': 'SPY PUTS #2🌈🐻 OG[deleted]', 'label': 1}, {'text': "I'm still buying your paper hands.

I\'m assuming you smooth brains have at least heard of the ***Dotcom bubble***. Maybe you\'re a baby and are more familiar with the ***Housing Bubble***. Well let me tell you something: next up is the ***Unicorn Extinction*** bubble!!\n\nI love Unicorns, so much so that it\'s my last name and also the name of my business (totally serious) but this inevitable crash is as much a "hypothesis" as evolution is. But the markets seem to love and worship these billion dollar tech unicorns more than I do.\n\n*So here\'s the breakdown for you retards. I even used crayons and highlighters, and I\'ll outline it from top to bottom and spell it out to make it really easy for you to understand. Get your kool-aid and prepare to learn something.*\n\nWhat you\'re looking at below is ***$SPY*** which represents the S-and-P 500. Ooh letters and numbers!\n\nYou know that thing with numbers that you see on the TV sometimes? No, not the channel with the big yellow bird. You see it on that station at the bank that Mommy takes you to sometimes. It\'s called "C-N-N" and it\'s like REALLY boring, but you sit and drool with a dum-dum in your mouth (because that\'s what you are) and listen to them say things like "The S and P is down 15 points today." It\'s a bunch of silly made up words, I know. But those numbers are the reason Mommy is crying and talking to Mr banker...\n\nHere, I\'ll illustrate it for you. I even used crayons and highlighters. We\'re going to look at the pretty picture from TOP to BOTTOM, okay?\n\nSo the lines underneath the actual stock price are moving averages (MA). They are the mean line of what a stock should be doing based upon its history. From warm colors (short term MA) to cool colors (long term MA) it\'s ***normal to see a bit of divergence***. However, the further apart these lines get, the more it\'s indicative of an ***over-valued market***, maybe so much so that it\'s going to be a free-fall as the bubble pops. The case I\'m making for this Unicorn Extinction (*yes, I\'m coining this term, and fucking some financial analyst better quote me when I\'m right*) is the result of ***hyper-inflation*** (fed printers go BRRR), ***ridiculous speculation***, and ***over-valued businesses*** (mostly tech) yet again.\n\nThese moving averages have the highest divergence they\'ve ever had!! That\'s not normal, and it means a price correction is coming, and it\'s going to be a fucking blood bath! The large green highlight is where the market SHOULD be, at least in my humble and moronic opinion.\n\nThe next box down is a Relative Strength Indicator (RSI). I won\'t get into the math, because 1+1=banana to you 🦍. Essentially "traders" (that\'s a big boy word) use this to know when a stock is over-bought or over-sold. Are you seeing a pattern on this screenshot?\n\nThe last box down, is harder to see, but this is your Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). It essentially a mean of other Moving Average lines to indicate when a stock is going to switch directions. I\'m zoomed out so far that you can\'t see all of the warnings, but I\'ve circled them for you. These were the major signs that a crash was coming in the past.   You\'ve been warned. Hope you are prepared for this next crash, and if you want to profit while others suffer (it\'s a bittersweet feeling) then you can do as I\'m doing and short $SPY.\n\nAlso, fuck your 💎👋 and 🚀 because I already played that game.

Once AMD is able to pick production back up, sales will go through the roof. There is so much demand for their product it is insane.

I believe they are working together on Amazon\'s long overdue Prime Air fleet which will give BB access to autonomous flight data from hundreds of thousands of drones. This will put them years ahead of any evtol manufacturer or rtos developer and secure a monopoly in endpoint management for virtually anything on the IOT and is capable of moving vertically.\n\nToday, BlackBerry was featured at Morgan Stanley Technology\'s media conference. Charles Eagan (BB\'s Chief Tech Officer) answered a bunch of questions about security, IVY, QNX, end-point management etc. [Link to Webcast](https://morganstanley.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1430549&amp;tp_key=381e2505f3). (Drones mentioned at 18 minutes)\n\nWhen asked about drones, Charles said: "we are not allowed to talk about which vendors are using which tech," and "there is a number of active drone engagement that are happening"\n\nThis practically confirms my theory that 1) IVY is being developed for not just ground based vehicles but flying ones as well and 2) they are working on it with some degree of secrecy.\n\nAmazon\'s drone fleet running on IVY will a great catalyst for BB share price... and that announcement can come at anytime. There is also some speculation going on about potential acquisition of BB, which isn\'t that far-fetched considering how John Chen joined Sybase in 1998, reinvented the company, and sold it to SAP a decade later.\n\nPositions: April $12.5C, June $13C, June $15C, and a boatload of shares', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'And I thought stimmy would safe my Spy FDs', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'When Melvin gets their goons to spy on us retards.', 'label': -1}, {'text': "TSLA Options - profit from the dip?I'm a financially secure old guy who thought he could see the future, so I started buying TSLA in 2015.

Once that acquisition is approved by world regulators, arbitrage will stop and the stock will soar. Note that the acquisition doesn't have to close, it just needs to be approved for the Arbitrage to stop. Once Arbitrage stops, all of the short selling which is holding AMD stock down will stop, and AMD will rocket towards it's price targets between $106-135\n\n**Arbitrage effect on stocks**  \n In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the price difference. The short selling pushes the price of AMD down, continually, until the arbitrage stops. \n\nRead more on AMD Merger Arbitrage here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd\\_an\\_explanation\\_on\\_merger\\_arbitrage\\_and\\_how\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/)\n\nArbitrage will end when the share ratio between XLNX stock and AMD stock is equal, where there's no difference to be gained. Right now the share ratio difference is \\~1.57 or about 10%. The 10% difference is there for the chance that the acquisition does not go through. Once world regulators approve it though, the chance of acquisition is basically 100% and the share ratio difference will be 0. With no difference, the arbitrage trading and short selling stops and the stock rises. In the case of AMD, the average price target is some 30% over today's prices, so it should rocket.\n\n[https:\\/\\/public.tableau.com\\/app\\/profile\\/upndown\\/viz\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\\_16114624177710\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/gr9sro1mqg471.png?width=1002&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fc21af702904945f5aa76ae8d7d85c1be4c3a84)\n\n**Possibility of Arbitrage ending soon**  \nCEO Dr. Lisa Su has said many times that the acquisition will close by the end of the year. She's also always conservative in her estimates. Remember that she said revenue would increase by 37% in 2021, only to revise it in Q2 to 50% growth. Su, you sly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ligcuvdksg471.gif\n\nYou can track the regulatory approval status over here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\\_approval\\_status/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status/)\n\nThe US has already approved and Phase 1 of the approval process for the UK and EU will end on July 6th. If there are no objections, the acquisition is approved from them as well. There are not expected to be any objections. If there were any, they would go into Phase 2, which would end at the end of the year (Lisa's conservative timeline).\n\nThe big question is when will China approve? They're the last ones to give the approval. Well no one really knows when this is going to happen. In Oct. of 2020 AMD said they would be drafting a notification to SAMR (China). But that's really the last we heard of it. \n\nThere's a possibility that China will approve around the same time as the UK and EU, which could be as soon as July 6th. In that case,\n\n[butts](https://preview.redd.it/wsr44v9qlg471.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92b9ec2b60f88b9b5443895e00486e98edfa63ef)\n\nAMD announced on May 19th that it was initiating a $4B stock buyback.

She knows the arb is keeping the stock down and aims to profit from it. The timing of the buyback may suggest that she thinks the approval is going to happen sooner than the end of the year. \n\nEither way, the stock will rocket once the approval happens. Could be in less than a month, if not, then it'll be end of year. Either way we're making tendies, it's just a matter of how soon. Place your bets!

Here are some rockets for your upvote:\n\nSPY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nPerhaps you have heard, but the new thing is to short squeeze everything. There is no other type of DD, just short squeeze DD.\n\nDD actually does not mean due diligence, it’s actually an Akkadian term that Hammurabi came up with in ancient Babylon when he minted the first stock certificate in 1760 BC on a stone tablet, and his younger sister Iltani then tried to borrow it and sell it, and then he asked her to return it immediately, and she had to pay more than she sold it for to get it back. In other words, DD means short squeeze and short squeeze means DD.\n\nBut I’m now way off topic.\n\n**It is of course simple to do a short squeeze, and SPY is the thing that is not yet squoze.**\n\nFirst you find a thing people know, so it has meme potential and you don’t have to build brand recognition. This is actually more important than if anyone has shorted it.\n\nThen you declare a ‘short squeeze’ is possible. Again, it doesn't matter how much it's been shorted.\n\nLastly… You ‘short squeeze’ (*By buying tons of call options, which is actually a delta squeeze and then a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze SHHHHH*).\n\nWhy do I bring this up? I’m glad you asked. It's like I said, it's time to short squeeze SPY.\n\nYou may be thinking… what could be more idiotic? Is there a faster way to lose money? The answers are of course ‘nothing’ and ‘no’.\n\n**But those thoughts don’t serve up confirmatory bias. So instead, here’s a list of things that may help you with confirmatory bias:**\n\n1. Tendies\n2. It’s actually the SPDR, or Spider, S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust. Spiders are vicious ambush predators, the type that would trap and feast upon the tendies of a hedge fund manager if they could.\n3. Citadel Securities, Melvin Capital, and “The Hedge Funds” have surely shorted this at some point, and I hear they aren’t so popular around here.\n4. The short interest is 16%. That may not sound like a lot, but if 21% was good enough for AMC, surely 16% is close enough. More importantly, that is 362 BILLION DOLLARS of shares short. Even at its highest points, GME had something like 15 or 20 billion dollars short and the shorts had no choice but to cover. Even Stevie Cohen and Citadel can’t bail a bunch of hedge funds out of 362 billion dollars in an epic short squeeze of SPY! It would take a fed intervention, and they never do stuff like that.\n\nBut it gets even better! S&amp;P 500 futures trade in arbitrage (fancy word for ‘same way) against SPY, and there are currently bout 2.8 million of those outstanding. Each one is $210k, so this is another $588 billion dollars of exposure… and because each one technically has a long end and a short counterparty, it is in a way 100% short. Wow!\n\nOf course, none of this would be any good with a visual aid, since a lot of people here can’t read. Here’s a graph from the latest SpotGamma newsletter that shows the positioning of gamma vs SPY and SPX prices. They sadly don’t have ES. This suggests that squeezing up will be resisted by options at first and that squeezing SPY is unlikely to work, but don’t worry, the hedge funds would never see it coming if that call interest above suddenly became long calls!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/az9tllkyji471.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d85ed56f73dfc6da5786269195f63e561e15d68\n\nHistory is on our side too.

The hedgies will play dirty and do what is called a ‘short ladder’ attack. This consists of them going to home depot, buying a foot ladder, and swinging it in a low motion at your shins. It also makes your stock prices go down. I recommend buying cowboy boots to defend against this.\n2. The hedgies also can do 'naked shorting'. This is when they take off their clothes and dump ES futures, which just require a counterparty on the other end, and don't require you have the stock to sell, just that you post collateral.\n3. You guys will get distracted by a struggling retailer or mattress company or purveyor of lethal intelligence or something.\n\nPositions: I’ll buy some SPY calls tomorrow in solidarity and because I like to be excited about the stock market over the weekend. I currently have stonks that in aggregate make me effectively long SPY.\n\n*Disclaimer: This is a really dumb idea, don’t do it.

It's versatile.\n\nWhile the silicon shortage is still big and doesn't show any signs of slowing, AMD is still most likely making a shitload of profit from the continuous buyouts of graphics cards for mining and the continuous selling of CPUs.\n\n**EPS/Financial history**\n\nAMD has been continuously crushing quarterly earnings targets for at least the past year, and shows no signs of slowing. It has consistently maintained a steady and rising profit.\n\n[Constantly winning](https://preview.redd.it/qz0qs58rh9571.png?width=332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d615f35e833c3563f23d4de50afe3956f490d61b)\n\nOn top of this, the company has a total cash balance of 3.12 billion and a total debt of only 551 million, which is fucking great.\n\n[It's doing great with managing its debt and total cash to say the least](https://preview.redd.it/vh2sh5xai9571.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61451edd2ef36120f80b83aefbfbce123fe2813e)\n\nNot made up your mind yet? If not, I have even more great news for you! The company has been constantly underestimated/undervalued despite all these great numbers. The past 6 months have been shit which isn't to say it's been terrible in the long run which it definitely has not, but for a company that holds so much market in two major component categories at both the business and consumer level it's ridiculous for the stock to be consistently falling.\n\n[Constantly going down](https://preview.redd.it/j2pavto0j9571.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26816d6c905488484879bc98f527d8ac15accef9)\n\n**Shorts and shares**\n\nThe company is decently shorted with around 7% of the shares being shorted for a company with a solid background, which could be a disaster waiting to happen.

AMD is geared more towards the average consumer which makes up a large portion of the computer market. Not only this but AMD chips are appearing more and more in laptops and pre-built computers.

So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don\'t get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information.  So let\'s talk about it:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What\'s the deal:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide.  This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN\'s warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today\'s value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don\'t know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they\'ll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Now, the part the less intelligent "non-apes" don\'t seem to grasp, but the most important part:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLess discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they\'ve got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it\'s the part most people don\'t seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they\'re paying, which means it\'s in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as "gently nudging" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean "waterboarding until they comply".  You\'re already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why does any of this matter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, "fellow ape", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it\'s this:  If $AMZN\'s "win" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to "win", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE\'s price should not be 13.49 because that\'s what $AMZN is paying, that\'s wrong, and everybody who\'s been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that\'s what $AMZN\'s cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn\'t agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there the "non apes" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn\'t get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO\'d into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn\'t understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can\'t.

This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN\'s warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today\'s value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don\'t know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they\'ll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Now, the part the less intelligent "non-apes" don\'t seem to grasp, but the most important part:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLess discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they\'ve got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it\'s the part most people don\'t seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they\'re paying, which means it\'s in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as "gently nudging" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean "waterboarding until they comply".  You\'re already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why does any of this matter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, "fellow ape", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it\'s this:  If $AMZN\'s "win" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to "win", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE\'s price should not be 13.49 because that\'s what $AMZN is paying, that\'s wrong, and everybody who\'s been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that\'s what $AMZN\'s cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn\'t agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there the "non apes" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn\'t get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO\'d into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn\'t understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can\'t.

Am I stupid?So I took positions against SPY today (and against the DOW, A/K/A "Boomer SPY") because I noticed what I thought to be a divergence between the movement of the market and the underlying indicators.\n\nFrom April 23 to June 17th/18th we can see the following:\n\nThe price of SPY has increased slightly.\n\nThe MACD has formed two bear crosses. Importantly: the second cross is at a lower point than the first cross, and thus it diverges with the underlying direction of the stock price (which is positive).\n\nThe RSI is also at a lower point on June 17th than it was on Aril 23, despite the underlying price going up.\n\nBelow is everything I\'ve described thus far summed up in a doodle:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vabpwvs9s3671.jpg?width=1108&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bbdc21acb8bf33d5b1245b33d68e7d63cc73040\n\nGenerally, when you see the indicators moving in a bearish direction while the stock is moving in a bullish direction it can be an indication that the stock price may reverse. This is also known as a divergence.\n\nAnother bearish indicator can be when a candle closes below a moving average. Swing traders tend to look at the 9 day and 50 day moving averages for confirmation of whether to enter or exit positions. Here, we can we can see a full candle close below the 9-day MA on 6/17 and a full close below the 50-day on 6/18. I think this is pretty significant because these candle closes formed right after the lower RSI/MACD figures.\n\nFor full disclosure I have positions in SPXS (which is a 3X inverse SPY ETF) and SDOW (which is a 3X inverse DOW ETF). I think we may see a continued reversal into next week based on this information and I\'m posting this because I\'m curious if other people are taking similar positions, or at least selling positions in anticipation of a reversal?\n\nAlso this is not financial advice.

For the first time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 36,000 mark. A small-cap index rose 2.7%. A group of retail-trader favorites, including Gamestop and AMC Entertainment holdings had their best day since August.\n* More than 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies reporting third-quarter results outperformed Wall Street expectations. Since the start of the earnings season, this has laid the groundwork for a stock market rally.\n* Meanwhile, data showed that manufacturers faced persistent supply-chain challenges in October. Fed officials will meet this week as investors worry that the economy is facing the most widespread supply crunch since the 1973 oil crisis.\n* According to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, the bullish trend in equities may continue into the Thanksgiving holiday later this month, but "not for much longer," as the Fed is expected to begin tapering and earnings growth will slow further into next year.\n\n# [Chart and PT from 🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY - Monday Nov. 1, 2021 Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjaxvv/i_spy_monday_nov_1_2021/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qvxlpotz1x71.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b71778488bb60543c045bbb81d8129617bf7ff7c\n\n# Today\'s Price Action\n\nO: 460.30\n\n**H: 460.70  (0.14 from 1st 🐂  )**\n\nL: 458.21\n\n**C: 460.04 (0.52 from 1st 🐂 🎯)**\n\n[2 hr. ](https://preview.redd.it/orwhzcxq02x71.png?width=2686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe658e8b507bd7f0ca2e4e3a7cf4ed3e616c3ea2)\n\n[15 min. ](https://preview.redd.it/x8s9nn9e12x71.png?width=2686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cae13b1e7da71ba1a5666c2e081611abad5ed01)\n\n# Tuesday\'s 💩 👖 Shart Chart - 65m Timeframe\n\n* 🐂  in charge above 20 SMMA\n* 🔎 support @ 459.9\n* 🔎 resistance @ 461.38\n* Support - 358.39 - 357.42\n* 🐂 🎯  - 461.74 - 462.68 - 464.24 - 468.91\n* 🐻 🎯  - 455.86 - 454.8 - 453.52\n* ⏬ (gap fill) - 453.53 - 452.51\n\n[65m](https://preview.redd.it/r66g59nu62x71.png?width=2686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2ea0de2d19784d09682f2aa408ea4ce4ce29bb3)\n\n# Momentum - 65min.\n\n* 🐻  Divergence\n   * When an indicator disagrees with the price, this lack of synchronicity indicates a likely change with the chart.\n* 🐂  like to see it break trend and hit about 80.53 - 82.65\n* \\&gt;50 = 🐂 lean\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ba5s4zub2x71.png?width=2686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce118f38ac5d54109dc09e3d181f7eb9c014e53c\n\n# SPY v.

Why is that important? Well throughout these dips this week the stock always managed to recover and close above the 5 day EMA and the 20 day EMA... until today. \n\nThis closed the candle below the 20 day EMA of 470.4... historically looking back whenever SPY closed a candle below the 20 day it usually bounces near the 100 day EMA which is 455.2\n\nThe same applies to the daily bollinger bands. We had been bouncing off the mid bollinger and closing above it until today. We saw a close below the kid bollinger of 469.81... in general the price usually finds support near the lower bollinger band which is also near 457.15\n\nDaily RSI is in a downward trend and the daily MACD is going to cross over to sell very soon. \n\nAll of this brings me to the conclusion we will see 455 very soon... it should also be noted that there is a support line that perfectly runs along 455 which we saw SPY bounce off on 12/20/21, 10/6/21, 10/4/22, 10/30/2020, and 5/4/2020... yes this support line is almost a year and a half old. \n\nI am anticipating a sideways/ slight recovery and rest day tomorrow that should see a retest and rejection near that 20 day EMA before we close our 2nd candle below it.', 'label': -1}, {'text': '$120k gains on Spy puts.

Early morning we saw the test and rejection of the 20 ema. we shortly after saw the test and rejection of breaking the 50 ema which left us in limbo. \nwe tried during power hour to gain any momentum to run up and was not able to get any green momentum. we found ourselves selling off heavily right at the end there dropping as low as 466 before we closed. We also have a confirmed daily and weekly sell on the MACD along with a bearish engulfing weekly candle. \n\nnext week i expect a similar fate for us. i expect us to retest the support at the 50 ema which i suspect we will break easily at 464.5. from there we should continue this stair step down towards the final goal/ support at the 100 ema near 455. i suspect it to be closer to 456-457 by time we get there. i do find it rather healthy the way this sell off is happening. instead of wild -2%+ days we are slowly stair stepping down. i like it. \n\none thing im watching here is that in general gaps are filled. however if this stair stepping is continued the gap will be below both the 100 ema and the support line. we could see a fast wic down to fill it and a hard bounce. but if that red dotted support line thats over 1.5 years old is broken. we very well could see an even more significant 10%+ from ATH dip. im not convinced thats the market sentiment though yet and will evaluate once there. \n\nim playing my puts till we break below 460 then i will be looking to sell them and find some longer dated calls. i of course still play the intraday options but for my long term thats my play. \n\nof course added a picture of my positons to show im not full of it. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WYKp46C.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GZgW2Vw.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sHCaYGG.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/jhWHtaD.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BiH7thh.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/piOf3iG.jpeg', 'label': 1}, {'text': '$TSLA is wayyyy oversold!', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'PUTS Wrap up: AFRM, AMD, GME, BA', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Spy puts and spy puts only[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'How many of you retards think SPY will hit 480 again before the end of the January?

Working for Apple is a privilege and if you’re not willing to work for it there for base pay instead of full comp package, then maybe you shouldn’t work there in the first place.\n\n5. A shareholder proposal entitled “Reincorporate with Deeper Purpose” - AGAINST. Smells like California bullshit that will cripple Apple’s ability to move fast. \n\n6. A shareholder proposal entitled “Transparency Reports” - FOR. We need to know what Apple is up to China . This will hurt the company financially but is the right thing to do from a human rights point of view.\n\n7. A shareholder proposal entitled “Report on Forced Labor” - FOR. It is against everything Apple stands to benefitting from inhumane labor conditions. Would you want your own children to work for an Apple supplier? Probably not. Then you should for this.\n\n8. A shareholder proposal entitled “Pay Equity” - AGAINST. Apple already knows how to pay people who are crucial to the operation.

I'm just starting this thread for those of us who try to time the overall market using ETFs like SPY.  I have developed a system that I use in part of one of my accounts that has been working well, so I thought I would share it with anyone who is interested.  \n\nMy goals with the system were:\n\n1. To participate in longer-term market uptrends, but to step aside during downtrends (IOW, to engage in overall market timing), while at the same time,\n2. To smooth out returns by scaling in and out as the market moves up and down along its uptrend path.\n\nAnother way to put that is that I wanted to combine value and momentum, but on an overall market basis rather than on a stock-by-stock basis as it is usually described.  \n\nSo, while SPY is in an uptrend I want to be onboard, but I want to reduce my exposure as it runs up toward overbought conditions.  Then, when it pulls back, I want to increase my position to take advantage of the next runup.  Finally, when the short-term pullback turns into a longer-term drawdown, I want to get out completely and wait for the next longer-term uptrend.\n\nI also want to do all of this without making any guesses, forecasting, following news, etc.  I want it to be a purely mathematical system that could be traded by a computer.  It took some time, but I finally worked it out and have been satisfied with the results.  \n\nAnyway, without further adieu, here is where the system currently stands (I'll post every weekend with the latest signals, in the form of two questions with answers):\n\nShould we be in or out of SPY?

Nasdaq and spy couldn't be telling us any more clearly that we will be seeing a correction of 10%- 15% roughly. \n\nSpy broke another support today at 455.5 and not only that but it closes below the 100 ema all the way down near 451.8. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/O3fWIPd\nhttps://i.imgur.com/6K8TnxD.jpeg\n\nOn top of that nasdaq officially entered 10%+ correction territory. Nasdaq broke a major support today and will in my opinion see a dip to 14000. Which would give it roughly a 14% correction. \n\nWith spy confirming the close below the 100 ema we should see a dip to the 200 ema near 438. A dip here gives is about a 9% total correction. \n\nI believe once we reach these levels we will be able to see a full recovery and return of the bull run. For those of you who think stonks only go up... maybe go find a hobby for a little bit lol. \n\nHeres what i will be watching going into end of week. \n\nToday and right now Biden is speaking on covid. Hes inferring no more lockdowns or school closings and of course pushing his build back better agenda. Markets could see this as a positive and react that way tomorrow. I dont think we see a full on recovery just from that though. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kXtNyoG.jpeg\nIntraday we are in a downward channel and saw a bounce off support near 451.4 at close. I suspect we see a recovery bounce towards resistance at 457. \n\nResistance levels to watch intraday- 453 --&gt; 455 --&gt; 457. If we can break 457 we could see a bigger recovery run towards 469. \n\nLonger term resistance of 469 is the major resistance that needs to be broken in order to confirm the bear trends broken. Another note on the daily is that the 5 ema has formed a downward resistance line also at 460 that needs to be broken. \n\nSupport levels intraday is that 451.4... if we break this truthfully there really isnt much support till 440. \n\nToday for me was a nice day for me. $2400 gain day for me (not pictured is a call and 2 puts i closed). \nhttps://i.imgur.com/IEMIjMD.jpeg \n\n\nHow im playing the rest of the week. \n\nTomorrow im expecting a bounce to 457 resistance and that we will get rejected. Imma go in on some 456P 7-14 DTE once we get rejected at 457. IF we break 457 ill ride a small call position up. Im not sure where we would get rejected. Likely stop at the daily 50 ema 464. However, overall a close below the 100 ema on the daily should indicate a dip to the 200 ema near 438.

I fully expected after market and futures wise that we woulda started the day down 1-2% not up 1.5% i believe it was. Nonetheless today was a very telling day in my opinion. What we saw today was a retest of the upper limit of this downward bearish channel we have been trading in since January 3rd. Look at the green dotted channel on the 30 minute.

To me that showed that this did not have the momentum to break through. When we rejected the 441.5 twice i bought some 2/4 440P and 339p and one 1/28 440p... all three played very heavily. I got greedy and missed some gains though when we broke 430 for a second but recovered to 433 before market close. I was looking for the bottom drop and never got it.

Now apple can NOT hold the market up on its own as much as people like to think it can. However oddly enough once apple released cry*pto pulled outta its nose dive and spy went from red to green. However, take tesla for instance today... tesla was down 5% while spy was up nearly 2% and tesla finished down 11%. Even the otherday on Tuesday Microsoft was up while the market was down if i remember correctly (or inverse). Either way what im saying is one company will not hold the market up. Though apple is the first big top 10 to release a stellar earnings so some sentiment may change... just keep in mind after and pre market are easily skewed by retail... tesla today was up right until the market open then we saw the true hedgefund take... \n(side note i bet tesla starts its decline down to 500-600 now... tesla today once again broke 25% correction from highs... the market FINALLY sees tesla as over valued and i think we see them take a fairly big hit down. Once this does it will finish our correction of spy and nasdaq to total of 25%... i think msft and apple will maintain their valuations). \n\nSo onto tomorrow what should we suspect? \n\nWell interestingly after hours on my chart (some webull users say they did not see this on theirs).

We DID break it very quickly but the buy pressure was too much. This is our fight zone. 430 and 440. One thing i am seeing is we have moved so far upward in this green dotted channel that unless we see some massive sell off days despite being bearish long term we will break it. However 2 or 3 days of nothing but sell offs (which we have not seen any days of just pure red this week will push us low enough to stay in the channel). Realistically we need a red day to finish down 1-2% in order to stay in this channel. And honestly we are kinda due for one.

So those of you who tuned in for the intraday discussion today (which was a lot of fun doing that together and seeing everyone talk) those wont be happening as much now. I hope to do them one or two days a week still though. I also will still try to update daily like i have been. Just some times posts may not happen to very late into the night. \n\nWell SPY like always wants to be the wild child of the stock market. However, even in her wildness she gives us signs and hints of where its going (thankfully). \n\nHistorically January tends to be a bearish month, however, unless you live under a rock for the last few weeks you would see we had A LOT more than usual. From increasingly out of control inflation, ole Putin stepping out and then of course daddy powell. Big oof this month, however, as people like to say never bet against the stock market. So heres what im seeing and where we are going. \n\nToday we saw yet again a volatile day. I think i can speak for many of us that we expected the typical dip, run and then dip at the end of the day. Its friday after all... but spy lovessss to switch it up. That resistance line (the green dotted) was so u believably strong it had been tested and rejected 6 times. But one ole Biden started speaking he whispered sweet nothings to the market and boom boom we broke the major resistance trend.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Z00hnlW.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/cW0pqOE.jpeg\n\nIronically our sibling NASDAQ saw their similar downward channel break too. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/lelrP8G.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hr0Y5ol.jpeg\n\nOn NASDAQ we got the MACD curling up to sell and the RSI trending upward. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/StW61cG.jpeg\n\nOn spy we have a very similiar setup occuring too. https://i.imgur.com/PPJ4oCn.jpeg\n\nHeres what im seeing and where we may be headed and how im playing the month of February.\n\nSo nasdaq. Im seeing a clear break of the bear channel (blue dotted). But im seeing another clearly formed bullish channel (white dotted). Im seeing a resistance line near 14.1k (using previous high from 1/4 and 1/13 a perfect intersection happens at 14.1k at the top resistance line of the white dotted channel. Im also seeing the daily 20 ema intersecting around this area too. Will definitely be keeping an eye on this. \n\nNow with spy. We are looking at the red dotted bullish channel. Im watching a similiar trend line from 1/4 and 1/13 which intersects the top resistance line of the red dotted channel near 456. \n\nI note that SPYs channel is more aggressive than the NASDAQ channel. However both are on very similar trajectories here. \n\nNow one thing i will be watching is that even im this new bullish channel for spy is that we have a lot of downside still. The 30 min and 1 hour are still pretty overbought (not extremely but slightly). There is still a chance we see a major sell off sometime next week perhaps even monday. Currently support will be somewhere by time pre market moves and everything around 428-430. After such an impressive end of day run today it would be natural to expect some to be given back monday. \n\nHeres how im playing the next few weeks... (keep in mind im going back to work full time night shift so i also wont be able to day trade as much as i could the last 2 weeks).\n\nIm going to be watching the charts next week come monday and be looking for a small dip to go long on some calls here. I will be doing my normal style: first otm strike for whenever i finally buy in but im going to do a 14 dte. Will plan to hold for some nice profit and then roll it out depending on gains and everything provable every 7 days. \n\nIm going to be watching for the upper resistance line test near 448-450 short term next week and long term of 456 by 2nd week of February. \n\nI still hope to do some intraday trading but because of work im gonna be doing mostly longs holding and rolling profits unless i see a change of direction.\n\nOne thing everyone needs to watch out for is Feb 10th inflation data releasing.

Dead cat bounce confirmed? 🤔🤔Really kind of a meh day. if you were patient and waited for a good entry this morning you are probably did okay.\n\nLast few days we have seen a small dip and then rip during power hour. I like to say don't fight the trend... however it appears today we saw a flip in that trend. We did not see the crazy after hours pop. \n\nSPY:\n\ntodays over all while kinda a sideways day but bullish. we tested and are held above the daily 100 ema of 454 which is extremely bullish.\n\nwe currently are looking at a daily MACD buy signal. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/JMgvwjr.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/liLJR8J.jpeg\n\nresistance wise we are looking at heavy heavy resistance at 458. We need to be able to breach that before we can see 460. \n\nThe close above 454 was a possible indication we are going to continue this short term bullish movement. However, after hours Meta (fb) just posted a massive miss (im assuming havent looked at report myself) but they are down an incredible 19% which im sure you can imagine is bringing QQQ and SPY down a significant amount. \n\nPrior to meta missing and dragging down SPY which broke our support line and currently has this down 0.7% after hours and clingly to dear life above the daily 100 ema of 454.... i would have suspected that tomorrow we would get a test of that 459.5 resistance however it looks like this bad news from meta just might be enough to kill the short term momentum. \n\nAs always do not fight the trend. We need to be careful to keep what we want separate from what its doing. I dont hold positions over night anymore especially during times like these. \n\nWe need to see how after hours and pre market sort out but tomorrow we may see the inverse of today which would be a small pop in morning followed by sell off. This very well could be confirming the dead cat bounce. We need to see how tomorrow shakes out but even without a 459 resistance test this could start its next phase of dip. \nAn important level i will be watching on the daily is the 5 ema  sitting at 449.6... a break below this would confirm the downside in my opinion. The 5 ema likes to act as support or resistance depending on the trend. Tomorrow everyone needs to be careful if you are bullish that we dont miss the top of the dead cat and if you are bearish that you dont let an over reaction of the market to meta give you false bias. \n\nNote- post is fluid as meta continues to change after market levels.\n\nQQQ:\nWe tested and held above the daily 200 ema of 363.5 (low of day was 364 though). This overall is bullish. \n\nwe currently are looking at a daily MACD buy signal. \n\nSupport to watch for tomorrow (updating this real time as im watching meta effect the market negatively). We need to stay above 363.4 which is the daily 200 EMA. However, we just dipped nearly 2% after hours and broke that like nothing. \n\nWhile we did break a major resistance yesterday today has some worrisome bearish signals we need to take seriously. Yesterday we very nearly avoided closing a bearish red hanging man candle but the power hour pump saved us. Today we closed the red bearish hanging man candle... this can be a signal of a reversal. We very well may continue to see downside tomorrow and the rest of the week. \n\nA key level to watch is the daily 5 ema of 361.3 this is the last support that keeps me believing we are short term bullish. Once that breaks i think its time to flip back to puts. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/gFC6fXQ.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/uDZigUO.jpeg\n\nOkay so wtf do we do tomorrow? \n\nWell a couple of things to keep in kind. \n\nAfter hour trading is lower volume and can be way more extreme. We should expect in the morning to give some of these losses back as people buy the dip. \n\nToday may be the inverse of what tomorrow brings. Id look for some sort of significant retest of those major supports (SPY 454 and QQQ 366). Look for the rejection to confirm this during market hours. I think a rejection may be your sign to be bearish.\n\nThe market was in a clear correction 2 weeks ago and was in my opinion saved by the tech earnings posted last week. Many of us had even said how looking at last friday it felt artificially run up and didnt make sense to not be dipping. \n\nDo not fight the trend. Let the chart tell you where its going. Dont over analyze or look for something thats not there. (Still working on this myself).\n\nAlso it appears some of that wild volatility we saw over the last weeks is gone. Entry points and exit points are more crucial now. If your trade goes against you it may not come back later in the day like we saw it do 2 weeks ago. Same if you get the right movement maybe its time to take profits early. Dont be greedy. \n\nAnd for my critics who will say dIdNt YoU jUsT sAy AtH? No i didnt. I posed a question to get people to think. And had the market continued its momentum from monday and Tuesday to today and had META beat earnings them being up 19% vs down 19% changes the dynamics. We need to take this market day by day. I highly recommend closing any intraday/ swing positions over night as anything can happen over night. \n\nOne last minor thing im seeing is that bit*coin failed to break its 4 month old resistance line.... \n\nOverall i need to see how tomorrow plays out but it may be time to get back into puts.... we just may see the next leg down starting right now. Amazon friday may be the only thing that saves this bigger dip from happening... or accelerates it.", 'label': -1}, {'text': 'AMZN Stock Split[removed]', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'MSFT[removed]', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Is QQQ guiding SPY?$SPDR® S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust going into today after yesterdays green day and after google/ amd popped off after hours... my question that i expect to get an answer to today is whether $Invesco QQQ Trust is forshadowing where SPY is going. \nlet me explain...\n\nso with the January dip we saw two highs on 1/4 and then 1/13. as we know Tech was the heaviest hit by that dip with QQQ being way over weight tech they obviously saw a much bigger correction around almost 20% from the high while spy only saw 10%... \n\nnow lets look at last week and this week. whats driving the market? tech of course. so today we saw spy break and close above 365 which if you see on their daily chart means they broke their resistance line from 1/4 and 1/13 (white dotted). \nmy forshadowing thought process is that SPYs equivalent resistance line from 1/4 and 1/13 is around 460. many if not everyone is citing how 460 is going to be a major barrier for SPY to break. but what if it actually isnt going to be? \nthink about it... QQQ closed above and broke their resistance line. techs (google) gonna push this bullish tomorrow. \nSPY closed at 452.95 and bumped to 455 after hours... if SPY saw a 2% day tomorrow it puts it near 462... 2% bull day when google is up 10% after hours is not unrealistic at all. \nQQQ next resistance is 376 (daily 50/ 100 EMA). That would only take a 3% tomorrow to touch resistance there... which is not unrealistic. \nso the question is... right now is QQQ leading SPY and foreshadowing further upside for at least this week?\n\nin my opinion yes. im watching for QQQ to break its 376 resistance. if we see a rejection SPY may see a rejection of 460 but i suspect this bullrun continues through end of week assuming meta and amazon continues the tech earning beats... \nhttps://i.imgur.com/eW1BpmR.jpeg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fEPjHJM.jpeg', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'First ever options trade what do I do ? 470 feb 14 spy calls[removed]', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'AMZN Strangle ideas?[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': "AMZN Strangle ideas?Anyone got any AMZN strangle ideas?

I have moved my funds over to TOS but unfortunately to start trading options cash only they need the bank transfer to fully settle first. So i hope to be back trading thursday at the latest. \n- quite a few of you reached out today and shared their 5-10% wins for the day! Congrats guys on the first day of small gains beating yolo gains. \n- a couple reminders here... \n1. There may be days like today where there isnt a clear direction or a clear run that SPY is going on. If its flat and you dont think confidently you can make a 10% options trade. Sit the day out.\n2. Some have mentioned they made 2 or 3 10% trades back to back today. Thats fine and nothing wrong with that. But dont get greedy by over trading. You can force a trade when you dont need to and be just as greedy as if you had just held the first\n3. This challenge isnt for everyone and clearly some people dont understand what its all about. Everyone has a different risk tolerance. And everyone needs to do whats right for them and their families. Some may only be able to do 5% some 10% some 20%. \n4. I made it clear we never let the trade go red. But let me clarify that as there is some confusion. When you first enter you may initially be red momentarily. Its only to be down 5-10% for a few minutes. We may not always as much as we want to catch straight green. But what i meant by this is we never let a trade thats up 10, 20 or 30% finish red because we got so greedy and it turned fast on us. It happens unfortunately that we are right and made a great trade but there is an unexpected reversal. Have a stop loss. \n5. I mentioned a break even stop loss is better than red. Some didnt understand that. Yes being up 10% you probably should take profits and walk away. But if you really think its gonna go your way and really think its going to run. Set a breakeven stop loss and let it go. Of course if you were right and you get 15-20% up move that stop loss to 10%. This eliminates red days. \n6. This is a completely different approach than most people take which is why its getting so much flak. Most people who do options are 100% gambling. They see SPY had a red day and say yes man 10% OTM calls for tomorrow 0 dte for sure. Thats gambling not investing. We dont yolo. We make an informed and calculated move. \n\nAgain once i finally have settled funds i will include my entry and exit with what % i closed at everyday.', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'I predicted NVDA not being able to purchase ARM and was laughed at….. tomorrow evening I’ll be laughing in my limbo!', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Peter Thiel to step down from board of Facebook parent Meta', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Going all in on a fb meta swing[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Need suggestion on Meta options[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': "Facebook aka Meta, I don't like this stockIn fact, I hate this stock.

We saw a very vulnerable and sensitive SPY today. We saw early morning future dip near 436 before recovering to green at open. The fed president spoke on CNBC around 830a and essentially said a whole lot of nothing but did say inflation was worse than expected. Markets than began their sell offs. We seemed to had established a pretty clear and cut downward trend making lower lows from around 945 am to 1115a. Then the market got its first bit of wild reaction to news. The feds dropped a "consumer inflation" survey which supposedly showed that consumers thought inflation wasnt that bad and would be better by end of year.... markets reacted positively and took off for the higher resistance... burning us put holders.\n\nJust when we thought we were going to test the upper resistance line of 444... we got "news" that the US was evacuating the embassy in Ukraine and apparently tanks were seen at the border... markets went spiraling down and broke the low of the day landing near 435.3.\n\nThen they say JUST KIDDING THERE IS NO TANKS... and markets ripsawed back towards the highs rejecting at one resistance line near 440.1... we then finished essentially flat closing the day red down 0.33% at $439.02\n\n\n\nSo what did we learn today?\n\n\n\nWell we learned there is a clear resistance line that will need to be broken near 441.6. We also saw despite the flat day we did see a lower low on the daily.\n\n\n\nOverall 5 out of the 5 last mondays the daily candle finish has predicted the weeks finish... it will be interesting to see if we finish red this week or not.\n\nSupport lines to watch\n\n438.9 --&gt; 436.26 --&gt; 434.24 --&gt; 432.15 --&gt; 427.27\n\nResistance lines to watch\n\n439.5 --&gt; 440.2 --&gt; 441.5\n\nTomorrow we still could go either way and we very well could see another sideways day. Right now we do not have any bullish and we dont really have any bearish catalysts to propel the market either way. One interesting note today was that QQQ/ Nasdaq was green while SPY and DOW was red most of the morning. Nasdaq managed to finish green despite an overall red (but flat) market.\n\nPostions-\n\nI sold my 2/18 441P i picked up friday for a 5% loss and I sold my morning 2/16 438P for a 15% loss both during the 1115a market pump.\n\nI also sold a 2/16 440C for a 5% loss right as market was dumping at 115pm.\n\nOverall portfolio-\n\nP/L %- 95\n\nP/L- $3000.\n\nWhat did we learn today? We learned that in a market like this 10-20% gains are king. Had i just taken profits at 20% and been satisfied this morning I would have been far better off. Nonetheless we all still struggle with greed and wanting more. Today though i will say we all experienced an unfortunately fake pump and fake dump because of the news.\n\nWe have to remember on fustrating days like this that no matter how good we are and how careful we are the market sometimes is going to do unpredictable things. We never FOMO in and we never revenge trade. we manage our losses appropriately and live to trade another day.\n\nI hope everyone enjoyed the live intraday discussion today and i will be holding another one tomorrow.\n\n(Ill add picks later reddits being weird)', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'How’s 2022 going with everyone? Here is mine a nutshell! And why I’ll go all in $NVDABack in mid December 2021 after the fed meeting the market had a rally, all my heavey tech based positions (all in blue chip tech, with no investments in ballooned uniform companies) recovered from the minor dip of November caused by omicron, from the meeting my takeaway was that the market will get oversold early 2022. I’ve then asked advice from a friend a trust with over 30 years of trading and his feedback was that worse case scenario is a 10-15% correction early 2022.

The only people who don’t know that are the team at Reddit, who can’t be bothered to build a decent search interface. So instead we resort to using Google, and appending the word “reddit” to the end of our queries.\n\nPaul Graham thinks this image means Reddit as a social media site “still hasn’t peaked”. What it actually means is that the amount of people using Reddit as a search engine is growing.\n\n📷\n\nWhy are people searching Reddit specifically? The short answer is that Google search results are clearly dying. The long answer is that most of the web has become too inauthentic to trust.\n\n## How do we know Google is dying?\n\nIf you’ve tried to search for a recipe or product review recently, I don’t need to tell you that Google search results have gone to shit. You would have already noticed that the first few non-ad results are SEO optimized sites filled with affiliate links and ads.\n\nGoogle still gives decent results for many other categories, especially when it comes to factual information. You might think that Google results are pretty good for you, and you have no idea what I’m talking about.\n\nWhat you don’t realize is that you’ve been self-censoring yourself from searching most of the things you would have wanted to search. You already know subconsciously that Google isn’t going to return a good result.\n\nI’m far from the only one who thinks Google is dying:\n\n[Daniel Gross](https://dcgross.com/a-new-google)\n\n&gt;In 2000, Google got popular because hackers realized it was better than Lycos or Excite. This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren’t using Google anymore.\n\n[Ask HN: Has Google search become quantitatively worse?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29392702)\n\n&gt;The results keep getting "refined" so as to suit the popular 80% of queries, while getting much worse for any technical or obscure queries. Forced synonyms and "people also searched for" are typically useless and almost infuriating. Once you get off the first or second page, the results get even worse-- with pages entirely unrelated to the query (e.g. not even containing the searched phrases). They are probably testing/already implemented some sort of multi armed bandit type optimization like on Youtube\'s search results where they just show any popular pages (ignoring relevancy) to see if they yield a click.\n\n[Michael Seibel](https://twitter.com/mwseibel/status/1477701120319361026):\n\n&gt;A recent small medical issue has highlighted how much someone needs to disrupt Google Search. Google is no longer producing high quality search results in a significant number of important categories.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Health, product reviews, recipes are three categories I searched today where top results featured clickbait sites riddled with crappy ads. I’m sure there are many more.\n\n[Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1477760548787920901)\n\n&gt;This may not just be a problem with Google but possibly also the recipe for beating Google. A startup usually has to start with a niche market. Why not try writing a search engine specifically for some category dominated by SEO spam?\n\n## Why is Google dying?\n\n### Ads\n\nIt is obvious that serving ads creates misaligned incentives for search engines. The founders of Google pointed this out themselves when they were just getting started.\n\n[Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page (1998)](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html)\n\n&gt;“Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users…we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers…Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.”\n\nUnfortunately, these thoughts on the failings of ad-based search engines read like an instruction manual for what Google did next.\n\nThey’ve dialed it up to the max recently to squeeze out every last cent before their inevitable collapse.\n\n📷\n\n### SEO\n\nThere are tons of people whose sole job is to game their way to the top of Google, so it shouldn’t be surprising when search results deteriorate in quality. To be fair, this would probably be an issue with any search engine, but you’d expect Google to be able to come up with a less gameable algorithm.\n\nHere’s a [fun story](https://alexskra.com/blog/the-mermaid-is-taking-over-google-search-in-norway/) about how one website gamed their way to the top of Google in Norway.\n\n### AI\n\nGoogle increasingly does not give you the results for what you typed in. It tries to be “smart” and figure out what you “really meant”, in addition to personalizing things for you. If you really meant exactly what you typed, then all bets are off.\n\nEven the exact match query operator (“ ”) [doesn’t give exact matches anymore](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27052634), which is quite bizarre.\n\n## Why are people appending “reddit” to their queries?\n\nThere’s a fun conspiracy theory that popped up recently called the [Dead Internet Theory](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/). The claim is basically that most of the internet is bots. There aren’t real people here anymore.\n\n[IlluminatiPirate](https://forum.agoraroad.com/index.php?threads/dead-internet-theory-most-of-the-internet-is-fake.3011/):\n\n&gt;TLDR: Large proportions of the supposedly human-produced content on the internet are actually generated by artificial intelligence networks in conjunction with paid secret media influencers in order to manufacture consumers for an increasing range of newly-normalised cultural products.\n\nThis isn’t true (yet), but it reflects some general sense that the authentic web is gone. The SEO marketers gaming their way to the top of every Google search result might as well be robots. Everything is commercialized. Someone’s always trying to sell you something. Whether they’re a bot or human, they are decidedly fake.\n\nSo how can we regain authenticity? What if you want to know what a genuine real life human being thinks about the latest Lenovo laptop?\n\nYou append “reddit" to your query (or hacker news, or stack overflow, or some other community you trust).\n\nGoogle is dead.\n\nLong live Google + “site:reddit.com”.\n\n*If you are interested in more thoughts and ideas on search and organizing information, you may want to follow me on twitter* [*@dkb868*](https://twitter.com/dkb868)*.*\n\n## Appendix 1: response from Google.\n\n### Google claims the exact matching feature is merely unintuitive, not broken\n\n[Danny Sullivan](https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/1493702054673485826):\n\n&gt;I work for Google Search, passed your feedback along, thanks. You said in the post that quotes don\'t give exact matches. They really do. Honest. Put a word or phrase in quotes, that\'s what we\'ll match. If anyone has an example where they feel it doesn\'t, please let me know...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Here\'s why people often think quoting with Google doesn\'t work when it really does (I\'ve looked a huge number of these reports).  \nWe match ALT text  \nWe match text not readily visible, such as in a menu or small text  \nPage has changed since we indexed it  \nPunctuation...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Punctuation comes into play if you did a quoted search like "dog cat" and there\'s text that says "dog, cat" then we\'ll see that without the punctuation. That doesn\'t seem a major issue but we\'re looking at if we could improve there.\n\n### And Google seems to be right so far\n\nEvery example of exact matching not working so far can be traced back to issues with punctuation, alt text, etc.\n\nFor example, one proposed [failing query](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30355528) was "quotes don\'t give". But HN user [saalweachter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30356152) has pointed out that it is a very intricate punctuation problem.\n\n&gt;For instances, on the \\["quotes don\'t give"\\] example, the first result I get is https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/never-give-up  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If I do a find-in-page for "quotes don\'t give", I get zero results. Oh no! Perfidy!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;... but, if you look more closely, you\'ll find this string waaaaay down at the bottom:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;tags: don-t-give-up, don-t-give-up-on-your-dreams, don-t-give-up-on-yourself, don-t-give-up-quotes, don-t-give-up-the-fight, encouragement, ...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thanks to the wonders of tokenization, that "don-t-give-up-quotes, don-t-give-up-the-fight" gives you the string of tokens, "don t give up quotes don t give up the fight", which contains the exact phrase "quotes don t give", which is the tokenization of the phrase "quotes don\'t give".\n\n## Appendix 2: Google just had record profits, you are obviously wrong, and Google isn\'t dying.\n\nI never said that Google wasn\'t making money. In fact, if Google really is squeezing every last cent out of ads without regard to search quality, I would expect their revenue to be at an all time high.\n\nI am saying that the quality of search results are declining. This may eventually lead to a decrease in revenue, but has not yet.\n\n## Apendix 3: Seriously, what are you talking about? My search results are perfect.\n\nIf you think your search results are perfect (without appending reddit), then you\'re probably right. If every single person agreed that Google search results were trash, then Google would already be bankrupt.\n\nPerhaps it is more likely that 80% of people think Google is good enough, and 20% think Google sucks.\n\nI do suspect that the 20% will be growing in number though.\n\n## Appendix 4: *Yawn*, this is the 87th time someone has claimed that Google search is dying in the last 20 years. This is a big meme in the SEO world.\n\n*"The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated" - Google, probably*\n\nYou\'re right, there\'s been a new article bashing Google every few months for the last 20 years straight. It\'s probably nothing.\n\nStill, it is a bit interesting that this short and simple post is now one of the most upvoted things of all time on Hacker News. There must be a lot of people who resonate with it this time around.\n\nHard to tell if something significant has changed.\n\n## Appendix 5: Random redditor explains it succinctly\n\n[u/a\\_latvian\\_potato](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/st9ri1/comment/hx3zubc/):\n\n&gt;I think I understand what this article is trying to say. It\'s not saying that Google\'s search technology is worse or that people don\'t use Google to search. It\'s saying that people trust less of the results Google shows compared to seeing discussions of it on Reddit.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For instance, if I\'m looking to see reviews of the Honda Civic 2022 or whatever, I actually do find myself typing "Honda Civic review reddit" instead of "Honda Civic review". This is because I want to see what real people and enthusiasts (on r/cars or whatever) are talking about the car, rather than the top results at Google which are basically just paid reviews advertising the car anyway.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even though I kinda know people in Reddit are just as capable of spouting BS that are completely wrong, I find the discussions more authentic anyway than the corporate speak the "big websites" have on their articles that Google shows me.\n\nSauce: [https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying](https://dkb.io/post/google-search-is-dying)', 'label': -1}, {'text': "How do the masses of $TSLA 🌈🐻's on this sub find boyfriends for their wives?[removed]", 'label': -1}, {'text': "I'm sitting on 60k of NVDA and AMD stock that dipped quite hard, thoughts?So 60k presently but I bought close to the top of the pump last november.

Today was no exception. Today we saw yet another trend reversal by the feds. Today was saw red most of the day, though it broke one major support at 443.1 and essentially filled the gap minus a about $0.25... for me thats considered a filled gap. \n\n2pm brought the release of the fed minutes from last month. Markets seemed to have been bracing for hawkish news however, apparently they digested it as doveish (mostly neutral/ no unexpected news) and the markets saw a 180 recovery. We turned a -0.7% day into a positive day within minutes. However, as quick as we saw the turn around the one thing i did notice was that we QUICKLY loss buyer momentum. Watching the candles and volume ticker move in real time once we high out first major resistance at the notorious 446 range i noticed we very quickly lost momentum and from there we struggled. \n\nThe biggest back and forth tug of war came at the 447 mark. pretty much the whole last hour it was nothing but back and forth. This shows me that despite the "good news" catalyst the market ran with there is still far more selling pressure compared to buying pressure. Eventually we started to break down right as market was closing for a hardly bullish but still green 0.11% finish at 446.1. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxgbde2a2ai81.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c80cfed28b226270d66ad5af8a2f30fcf1ff03d\n\nThe nice thing about the last 3 days it has given us a TON of support and resistance lines to watch for future movement. There is no doubt SPY is unpredictable but I am starting to see a few scenarios I think we see play out tomorrow and even into next week. Heres what i am seeing....\n\nOn the Daily we did finally see a close above the 8 EMA of 446.16 (barely) however, we failed to break or even reach the 20 EMA (next major resistance line) at 448.73. To me the face that this "good news" catalyst wasnt enough momentum to turn a mild red day into a very red day is a big concern. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hj0se97e2ai81.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cdcf986a7c1a9b4ad26505a47c1f589be343024\n\nLooking intraday I aslo notice volume (especially intraday) appears to be very low. Up until the fed minutes we saw even less volume than yesterday (based off the graph... someone can comment with the true numbers i dont have in front of me). \n\nSo heres where I think we could be going tomorrow and what would make a lot of sense and a few potential plays...\n\nIf you look at the daily chart (ignore all the vertical lines i had that different time frames do that to it.... those are actually horizontal support and resistance lines). But i want to point out the black dotted line. That line is the downward resistance line that started in beginning of January and eventually saw us dip to 420. That line is sitting right around 454 right now. \n\nScenario 1-\n\nWe see another green run up tomorrow to test that resistance line. Would be about a 1.65% run which is very well within range of a normal spy. For this scenario we would see a rejection a hard rejection. This rejection would confirm we are still in a dip/ bearish short term market. We would then finish here with a hanging man candle (most likely scenario) and the following day (friday) would see a massive sell off falling back down to the 447 range first and then continuing downward. Eventually down near 420 for an official retest (I still personally favor a full on retest of this area).\n\nScenario 2-\n\nMuch like scenario 1 we see a 1.65% green day where we test the 454 resistance area. BUT this time we break the resistance line. NOW with this scenario we would HAVE to break 458. If we fail to break 458 we will see a MASSIVE daily chart triple top... I do not need to tell you just how bearish and bad that would be. It is not out of possibility to do it tomorrow but a retest tomorrow of 458 would be 2.5%. However, it is absolutely unlikely in this current extremely low volume and flat market that we see that. Now if the volume magically returns tomorrow well its possible. But again we need to avoid a hanging man candle here and triple top... This scenario would also potentially play out over two days. \n\n\\-obviously if we did triple top at 458 we all know that would be a beyond bearish scenario. \n\nScenario 3-\n\nSeeing the intraday chart, especially during power hour, we saw all the buying momentum fade. Its arguable had we not had the fed minutes today we could have had a very very red sell off... and especially if the news had been even remotely hawkish we would have seen a very very red day (near 2% if we assume the same movement it did bullish but inverse). \n\n\\-There is very real possibility that tomorrow we start yet another sell off. Like i mentioned above we failed to break the daily 20 EMA of 448.73. If we see a porlonged dip back below the daily 8 EMA of 446.19 we very well could start to see another sell off. \n\nSupports\n\n446.2 --&gt; 445.8 --&gt; 445.4 --&gt; 444.8 --&gt; 443.6 --&gt; 442.7 --&gt; 442.3 --&gt; 441.7 (a major support that bulls need to hold) --&gt; 439.7 --&gt; 437\n\nResistance-\n\n447 (major resistance) --&gt; 448.1 --&gt; 451 --&gt; 454.4 (major downward resistance from january) --&gt; 455.5 --&gt; 458 (needs to be broken to prevent triple top)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me I will be looking for a longer term PUT play (Probably at least 14-30 DTE) IF we see a confirmed rejection of 454. If we break through 454 I will wait to see the test of 458. IF 458 is broke I will absolulely be getting some 14-30 DTE calls as there really would be nothing bearish to hold us back until March when they do their first rate hike and have another FOMC meeting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay story time because I will always be honest with you guys about my investments and my P/L.\n\nMany of you who follow me know I was traveling for work today but still was trading. This morning my plan was if we broke 443.1 to grab puts for the gap fill down to 440 area. Well unfortunately i was talking to my girlfriend and missed my entry. In my fustration (first mistake) and rush (2nd mistake) I quickly attempted to jump into a 2/18 442 PUT (we were near 442.8 i think when i did this)... Then to my astonishment i was VERY confused when when we kept dipping to the why my PUT was going red. At first I thought I got a bad fill or something. But then we bounced hard off that 442.3 area and I all of a sudden was in the green again... it then hit me... I MADE A BIG MISTAKE... In my fustration and rush i bought a fricken CALL instead of a put. I nearly shit myself at first. \n\nHowever, due to my late entry (and pretty much completely ignoring my own strategy cause i was too distracted) I realized i actually had a salvagable play. I was up 5% at one moment and i was very convinced I was going to sell and just take the W and be okay with my mistake.\n\nI then started to get my head outta my butt and actually look to see what i was seeing. It seemed the gap was going to fill as much as it wanted to and we were reversing. Through a VERY long and stressful day I held my call. never going down more than 15% (did around 1230 when the russia cyberattack news came out). To me that candle seemed sus and an outlier based on the actual trend so i held and it recovered. My stop loss was set at 20% the whole time... \n\nNow comes the really sketchy part but at this point I had accepted my mistake and was taking it to the fed meeting (I can handle a 20% loss for the potential of a gain here since i have had a great week....). So on my drive there is about a 45 minute stretch where i have no phone service and it just so happens that the 45 minutes brought me right to the fed minutes dropping at 2pm. I hit the service finally right at 2pm to see the massive dip (still had my 20% stop loss so i was safe) and then i saw it flip (like always first reaction is wrong) and it start going to the races. \n\nHeld it all the way to 447 and watched that fight for a solid hour. Finally during power hour when it dipped back below the 447 mark i took profits. Managed to get a wild 43% gainer on a complete honest 100% dumb luck mistake. I am not by any means a lucky person but this is the luckiest this that has every happened to me ever. \n\nThis did teach me a great lesson though. Double check orders no matter how rushed I am, and to always feel confident in the trend and if you miss the entry wait for the next one. This very well could have been a very very very red mistake. And it definitely gut checked me. But i wanted to share this with you as its a mistake any of us could make. And to show i am real and raw with my trades and trading life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP/L weekly %= 7%\n\nP/L weekly $= $4500\n\nCurrently holding 1 2/18 444P ($160 lotto for fun that i was comfortable doing with the week i have had)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCouple reminders-\n\nI know i made a pre market post today and i did say i would be able to comment much cause i was traveling. I know alot of you were commenting about entries and updates waiting for them. I apologize if anyone missed where I said i wasnt going to be very active due to travels. \n\nthere will be NO LIVE UPDATES INTRADAY until next friday February 25th due to work. I am working the next 6 out of 7 nights and then will be traveling February 24th back home again. The 24th like today will be able to post some some but the rest of the day i will NOT be posting intraday as I work night shift and sleep until 230 and trade power hour. \n\nI WILL still post my nightly TA and Analysis. \n\nSOME mornings i will post a premarket update if there is some sort of big drastic move that i feel warrants an update and changes my TA/ Analysis.  \n\nRemember we do not need 50-100% gains every day. We just need 10-20% gains every day and we need to mitigate our losses at 10-20% so they are easily recoverable in a day or two. When we start seeing major losses like 30-50% we have a VERY hard and long grind to gain those back. \n\nDespite my dumb luck today we HAVE to find the right entry.

The Metaverse is a poorly thought out attempt to pivot business strategies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disputing these thoughts; and why I'm Bullish**\n\n1. **Available user data does not reflect that Facebook is dying; or that it's user base is primarily boomers.** As of October of 2021, Facebook had **2.9 billion monthly active users** (\\~36% of the world's population) -- over the 13 quarters prior; Facebook has ALWAYS posted growth. \n\n* Analyzing that user base; \n   * 66% of those users login every day, \n   * **Median age of users is 31** \n   * **\\~60% of users are between the age of 13-34.**\n* Analyzing traffic\n   * Facebook is the 3rd most visited Website on the internet (behind Google and Youtube)\n   * 11.2B visits per day by 1.5B unique visitors\n      * The next most visited Social Media site is Instagram (which is FB) at 2.9B and Twitter at 2.4B visits. **Facebook gets \\~5x the visits by about \\~2x the unique visitors.**\n   * \\~22 minutes average time per visit\n   * \\~6 pages per visit \n   * **THIS TRAFFIC DATA DOES NOT REFLECT MOBILE APP VISITS, JUST BROWSER VISITS**\n\n2. The fact that Facebook gets 11.2B visits a day by 1.5B unique visitors means that while Apple/Google cutting off mobile data collection may have some impact on FB's revenue; **they still can obtain an enormous amount of data from browser access**. \n\n3. In 2022 the Metaverse is an outlandish concept that most of us (myself included) can see absolutely no value or utility in. Up to now VR has been a novelty with little application outside of video games and porn. It isn't wrong to be skeptical of this. **BUT** as of now Meta is way out in front on building an all encompassing virtual reality platform; and has cemented themselves as **THE** leader/gateway for anyone looking to develop a virtual reality product. If you need any confirmation bias that there is potential for value; Google which companies are investing in/working on/becoming a part of the Metaverse. **Facebook's Metaverse has a high probability to be for VR what iOS and Android have been for smartphones.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for why I believe Meta will see 500-1000% gains over the next 5-10 years:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe iPhone began development in 2004, was released in 2007, and reached most popular status in \\~2011. In that time Apple's stock price (adjusted for splits and approximated for an annual value) was \\~$.48, $5.40, and $12.10 respectively. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow comparing that to the intended timeline of Zuck's Metaverse: Development began in 2021/22. The development timeline that I typically see for release of a product resembling a genuine VR worldscape is \\~5 years. We'll call it 2027. Zuck is predicting 1 billion MAU on the Metaverse by 2031. If we apply the same price movement that Apple achieved with the iPhone; Facebook's current price \\~$210 rises to \\~$2,400 in 2027, and reaches \\~$5,300 by 2031. I appreciate that comparing those price movements is an extremely non-scientific method for prediction and that there was a lot of other shit going on with Apple in that timeframe; so I've applied a 50% reduction to those increases for the sake of conservativeness and we're still left with a share price of **\\~$2,150 in 2031.**   \n\n\nTLDR:   \nFB is still growing and primarily used by young people\n\nFB has more than enough browser based traffic to keep its data supply without Apple/Google's cooperation\n\nVR is a realistic/legitimate growth industry ; and FB has positioned themselves to create the iOS/Android that the rest of VR is run on. \n\nPrice target is $2000 by the end of 2031.

This is a very useful indicator as you can analyze the movements of the markets based on the normal distribution curve.  In normal distribution 68% percent of the data will occur within one standard deviation from the mean, 95% of the data within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% of the data within 3 standard deviations.  Over a large enough sample size the probability of the price of $SPY being further than 3 standard deviations away from the mean is less than 0.3%.  When markets opened Thursday morning the price was below the last bollinger band which happens very rarely.  Many high frequency trading algorithms noticed this and started buying like crazy causing a chain reaction which explains the market rallying Thursday and Friday.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPositions I played last week since positions are required in DD posts now:\n\n[Bought Thursday in after hours, sold Friday around 11:50am](https://preview.redd.it/8daxdhm2i7k81.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a72d545fe296e0a980a5ba9d7ceec7478242aedc)\n\n[Bought Wednesday throughout the morning, sold at the top around 3pm](https://preview.redd.it/46hrvgm2i7k81.jpg?width=1010&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7103f65f9ac4dc326fdf0b5f6846dbd7cbbddc33)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**----------This week----------**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/cqukbyisj7k81.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0100a7672ab1057d355ff1de49bff552fbda480)\n\nA new trend pattern has been formed in the markets with a diamond top.

Except Monday will have some sort of drawdown because this crazy buying pressure has to slow.  Powell will be giving his testimony on the economy on Wednesday morning.  Also the February employment report is being released on Friday.  The entire market will be watching what Jerome Powell has to say on the economy and more specifically what he says on raising interest rates.\n\n[Bill Ackman's Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/82krj56n08k81.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed010a5d21957f59e4fe96c91f22356596259644)\n\nBill Ackman gave a presentation to the Federal Reserve back in October warning them of the dangers from keeping interest rates 0% and from quantitative easing.  Bill Ackman has an influence on the federal reserve, he has also said the Federal Reserve needs to do one big rate hike to shock the markets and restore credibility.  I think when Jerome Powell talks he will mention that a 50bp rate hike is now being considered, like everything else that has happened recently this will cause the markets to violently overreact into the following days.  Wednesday will be a very volatile day, during Thursday and Friday the markets will gradually decline. \n\nNot professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more\n\n**----------TLDR----------**\n\nMonday🐂Tuesday🐂Wednesday😵Thursday🐻Friday🐻, Support\\~432, Resistance\\~452, JPOW important talk on Wednesday at 10am\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will respond to every comment!", 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Should have held SPY call way longer but gains are gains!', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'China thinks military operations in Taiwan - goodbye NVDA and AMD, welocme back INTEL', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'China thinks military operations in Taiwan - goodbye NVDA and AMD, welocme back INTEL', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'China thinks military operations in Taiwan - goodbye NVDA and AMD, welocme back INTEL', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'China thinks military operations in Taiwan - goodbye NVDA and AMD, welocme back INTEL', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'SPY $500, If So (Could be fake news)[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Texas wants to sue Meta into bankruptcy', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Putin goes Boom ☢️ PUTs on SPY', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'How will SPY close on Monday 02/28\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/t2qtyc)', 'label': 1}, {'text': '(FB) META PLATFORMS[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'stock market got me actin crazy 🥴 puts on SPY + calls printed.

It actually established quite the beautiful little channel too. The 8 ema crossed above the mid bollinger around midnight and has climbed from their using the 8 ema as support and the mid bollinger as backup support. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qp6z9zmzvkk81.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41e280cbe59d0e020426fc5c7cebfd30115a6e09\n\nAs you can see on the current SPY pre-market chart if we looked just at this we would miss the bigger picture and not notice the large upward channel we are in... Besides the random wic on the 8 am candle we can see we are still actually in an upward climb since open... \n\nFor many of us I think we still have a little PTSD from thursday morning where we saw a similar setup, however, way more extreme in how red it was. So what does that mean today...?\n\n1. we can NOT go into this perma bull or perma bear.\n2. We can NOT go into this thinking this is the same setup as Thursday\n3. we have to let the chart play out and go from there\n4. we have to take profits when they are given to us. \n\nSo what does that mean for today? Where are we headed? What are some important things to watch? \n\nPre-market we are actually in a range from 429.9 to 434. Today i suspect those to be our ranges too. If we manage to break above 434 we may see another bullish recovery (after all futures is showing this) and if some how break below 429.9 we may see some sort of wildly red day... \n\nThis market can only take so much bad news and so many major sell offs before it inevitably breaks down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ke56beq0wkk81.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebe0e211454499346372b663f1b925935b9b9351\n\nHere is a reminder of the daily chart and the channels we COULD be currently in. It also shows us that we failed to break back above the 200 EMA (439.48) which overall is a bearish sign. we now have also fallen back below the 8 ema on the daily...which is at what magical resistance number? 434.68... Yup the range limit from pre-market. Thats something that makes me go hmmm. \n\nThis daily chart also shows that 50 ema is sitting PERFECTLY lined up with the grey channel i have been watching since January started... Major Resistance is at 449.5 to confirm the dead cat bounce and inevitably the next leg down.\n\nOne other interesting note i did mention on friday analysis was that the daily finished with a hanging man candle... that could signal a reversal of trend. \n\nOkay so here is some levels to watch for today:\n\nSupport- 431.1 --&gt; 429.9 (lower range of pre market) --&gt; 427.7 --&gt; 425.9 \n\n\\-0.5%= 435.6\n\n\\-1%= 433.4\n\n\\-1.5%= 431.2\n\n\\-2%= 429\n\n\\-2.5%= 426.8\n\n\\-3%= 424.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResistance- 433.3 --&gt; 434 (upper range of pre market and daily 8 ema) --&gt; 434.8 (current upper bollinger band) --&gt; 435.6 --&gt; 436.7 --&gt; 437.6 --&gt; (Fridays after hours close)  --&gt; 438.6 (after hours high from friday)\n\n0.5%= 439.9\n\n1%= 442.1\n\n1.5%= 444.3\n\n2%= 446.5\n\n2.5%= 448.6 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately my kids school is closed today so i wont be doing a live like i had planned but i plan to do some trading if they will let me haha. \n\nMy goal is to watch opening hour and see what way we go. See if that 8 ema turns into support or resistance. I will be waiting for a candle to close above or below and then wait for my confirmation candle of support or resistance before i enter a position.

However, as I preach daily we can not go into a trading session bullish or bearish. We have to trade what is right in front of us. \n\nOverall Futures held up very nicely trading essentially completely flat all night until about 8am when we saw a massive spike in pre market taking SPY up to 441.5. However, that would be the high of the day and we would see a downtrend throughout the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2v7t8g7wl8l81.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a661c5c5cdcc44178793aa8222a734ddb5dd107c\n\nEarly morning we saw a very quick sell off taking us all the way to the intraday low of 433.8 before we had a classic SPY recovery/ rest near 439.4 (the daily 200 ema) before we continue back to the daily low of 433.8 during power hour. Overall finishing the day down only 0.48%. Which on the surface doesn’t seem like much, however, considering we Opened at 440.47 and closed at 435.77 that is quite the drop. Overall that a 1.1% decrease from open which is far more impressive then the actual closing % for the day.\n\nLooking at the 15 minute chart overall its fairly neutral and would really allow room for some upside and downside depending on where futures take us tonight. RSI is flat around 40 and MACD is technically a sell however curling back towards the 0 line… Interestingly enough the VIX again finished right near the 30 area. Crypt0 did see a larger sell off day today though which aligns with the market. Overall as much as I would like to get some direction of wher we are going to go we just don’t have enough information to play anything over night right here. It is also why we much go into a trading session with open minds and follow the trend intraday unbiasedly. \n\nMajor resistance line to break for a breakout- 443\n\nMajor support that needs to hold to prevent sell off- 434\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pz1r06vl8l81.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eba5b441cbca10f9201ed18bfcc56ce6c7212530\n\nThe daily chart does draw a big of a better picture of where things are headed but also does not give us any clear definitive direction. But I do see some major trend lines/ support and resistance lines we need to be watching tomorrow and headed into next week. \n\nTodays candle body broke above the 200 ema and the 20 ema on the daily for the first time since February 18th which is an overall bullish sign. However, we failed to close above the 200 ema (439.3) when it was very much so in range to do just that.\n\nTodays candle wic also broke below the 8 ema of 435.03, however, at the end we managed to push and close above that. \n\nOne interesting note on the daily chart is that the support line from the 410 V bottom that Tuesday and Wednesday candles used as bottom support was broke today.  \n\nGoing into tomorrow we will need to keep an major eye on these two support and resistance lines. Overall which ever one we close above or below tomorrow will in my opinion signal what next week will bring. \n\nSupport- 435\n\nResistance 439.3 \uf0e0 445 (top of grey channel) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall this is not an environment I feel comfortable holding or recommend holding anything over night yet. Tomorrow power hour that may change if we get some clear direction. In general the Major resistance line is 445. Until that is broken I don’t feel comfortable risking it on calls with potential short term upside. There is clearly a lot of downward room to 400 to go, but after yesterday markets are currently bullish so you would be fighting the trend.', 'label': 1}, {'text': '3/2/22 SPY DAILY ANALYSIS[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'I’m not sure if this makes me bullish on TSLA…[removed]', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'WSB every time $SPY drops 2 points on open[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'AAPL heading to $175+ over the next week.

Around 1pm we managed to poke through that downward resistance like to negate the channel completely. However, we failed to break through 433.4 and the very important resistance that I mentioned would be a big battle at 433.8.\n\nYesterdays after hours had us at a low of 427.8 which we managed to retest and hold as support today.\n\nWe now have two very clear lines in the sand of bull territory vs. bear territory.\n\nGoing into after hours tonight and Futures on Sunday… SPY needs to break and hold 433.8 in order to see upward bull momentum and SPY needs to break and hold below 427.8 in order to see a continued bearish sell off.\n\nOverall there is not really enough information until one of those two key levels breaks and holds to go long (hold over night) on any positions right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2cdhtof5vfl81.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c2eee2f72a0d9ee2435e239c023ea16b46f144d\n\nIf you take a look at the futures chart it does give in my opinion a slightly better picture of the overall trend that has been taking place since Yesterday morning. Overall it is making consistently for two days now lower highs and lower lows which is a bearish movements.\n\nFor those who watch futures\n\nSupport- 4304.7 \uf0e0 4293.5 \uf0e0 4283 (last support before major sell off)\n\nResistance- 4327.5 \uf0e0 4338.5 (last resistance before breakout)\n\nNow arguably my favorite chart to look at daily at night time to help piece together a better sense of direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/egazjko4vfl81.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af3bf883b2b1780db94bf8808ac1abfa2b309901\n\nI mentioned last night that I believed the 8 ema (which was support) and the 200 ema (which was resistance) was going to be our guidance of where this market was going to head next week depending on where todays candle finished.\n\nWhile there is a very miniscule gap I can see on the daily chart from 433.3 to 433.9 I do not think this is one that will need to be filled as on the actual 15 minute and other timeframe chart we do not see this gap.\n\nWe now have a candled fully closed below the 8 ema and 200 ema again which Monday will confirm but to me shows favor to a bearish week ahead next. However, if bulls can get this candle Monday back above the 8 ema and 200 ema we may see the upwards momentum continue.\n\nIn addition for more bearish indication it is noted the 20 ema is now completely below the 200 ema and continuing to dip further below. The daily candle (which im sure someone else will inform me its something different) is more or less a doji candle too which can be a reversal indicator but in simplest of terms is just a indecision candle.\n\nKey levels to watch.\n\nSupport- 427.1 (the low from March 1st) \uf0e0 421.4 ( the low from Feb 23 and the mid point of the grey channel)\n\nResistance- 434.3 (8 ema) 437 (resistance line from the high of feb 10th and Mar 3rd) \uf0e0 438.34 (20 ema) \uf0e0 439.23 (200 ema) \uf0e0 445 (upper resistance of the channel)\n\nSince I will not be posted a pre-market on Monday here are the levels\n\n0.5%= 434.3\n\n1= 436.5\n\n1.5%= 438.7\n\n2%= 440.8\n\n\\-0.5%= 430\n\n\\-1%= 427.8\n\n\\-1.5%= 425.7\n\n\\-2%= 423.5\n\n10% challenge-\n\nHow did you guys do?

Commodities are soaring: wheat futures, crude oil futures.  While the big money does not want to admit it, the inflation data released on the 10th will be worse than most people are expecting.   The situation in Ukraine is sadly not getting any better; Russia announced a ceasefire and then continued to shell buildings.  Since inflation is getting worse and commodities are soaring the fed is now forced into drastic measures to raise the interest rates.\n\nFrom the technical indicators the whole market is extremely bearish.

But doesn’t it? Doesn’t all movement matter when SPY and /ES are connected? If your answer is anything but yes you are doing your investments a disservice. We have to watch everything and factor it in. So this upward channel is broken which tells me we are going to start pushing towards that lower limit of the support line near sub-400 next. \n\nHere what I will be watching today. We did see a massive recovery but does that mean its time to buy calls? No. Okay… well we had a massive gap fill its absolutely time to buy puts right? No…. We wont know the game plan till this opens. My bias would lean towards retesting those Futures lows near 424 but we wont know where we are going until 930 when this opens and starts moving. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKey levels to watch-\n\nSupport- 429.8 \uf0e0 428.5 \uf0e0 427.8 (Fridays intraday low) \uf0e0 427.1 (the low from March 1st) \uf0e0 425.2 \uf0e0 424.2 (pre market low \uf0e0 423.5 (pre-market 8am wic low) \uf0e0 421.4 ( the low from Feb 23 and the mid point of the grey channel) \n\n\\-0.5%= 430\n\n\\-1%= 427.8\n\n\\-1.5%= 425.7\n\n\\-2%= 423.5\n\nResistance- 431.2 (currently pre market resistance high) \uf0e0 431.9 \uf0e0 432.6 \uf0e0 433.3 (Fridays intraday high) \uf0e0 434.2 (8 EMA daily) \uf0e0 435.2 \uf0e0 436.4 \uf0e0 437.4 (resistance line from the high of feb 10th and Mar 3rd)  \uf0e0 439.2 (200 ema daily)  \uf0e0 439.7  \uf0e0 445 (upper resistance of the channel)\n\n0.5%= 434.3 \n\n1= 436.5\n\n1.5%= 438.7\n\n2%= 440.8 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\nRemember as we go live today… the goal is to make ONE good trade the nets us at least 10%.

Second, Just because it was red yesterday doesn’t mean it’ll be green today. Third, Just because it was red yesterday doesn’t mean it will be red today. Lastly, We have to as day traders trade the chart that is presented to us. Each day is a slice of a the whole pie but each day is also its individual pie. We can not go into today with a made up mindset or we will get burnt. We HAVE to wait for our perfect setup and trade that. We have to secure profits and we have to be smart traders.

This morning we did see a very large double top at 4233 (423 SPY) around 7am (the random 8am candle also had a 3rd spike there too). This to me is going to be the major resistance to beat today.\n\nLooking at futures we do have yet another downward channel I will be watching for us to either trade within today or break.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9j20xvmh16m81.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3832ab64340c905ef1610c30ad5104c7553fe71\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gw76ebqi16m81.png?width=830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=350c52e721dd8a03919b6a7146ec78d9969d2b40\n\nSPY chart itself has a similar channel as FUTURES /ES has formed. We will need to keep a close eye on that. Pre-market is currently sitting at +0.05% green which is about as flat as we can be.

Its always hard to know whats real and whats fake from there. It makes our job today that much harder. Thankfully we have some trend lines we can watch. \n\nApparently the only new people are hearing is that made the market skyrocket was some good news from putin about Russia/ Ukraine, removing Russia as favorable trade status, and possible spending bill? Overall we do have some consumer data coming out at 10am we need to watch and IF this is really propped up by Russia we need to be very very careful. Also need to keep in mind according to CNBC the feds QE is apparently over as of yesterday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fe7xwhyxdrm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b346be77cdb373a7e5984d6ec2676cc733649b2d\n\nThe one thing I am seeing is a nice upward channel (short term) that we are trading within since March 7th. This is an important channel to keep an eye on. \n\nUpper resistance of that channel is 434 and lower support is 424. We also have an important support line that SPY was following PRIOR to the 615am spike. I find this support line to be the most important to watch today for whether we are going to continue upwards or not. That support will be around 428 at market open. We also are trading ABOVE the daily 8 ema now which is a very important shortterm bullish sentiment the 8ema sit at 427.2 and will be a key support for bulls to close above. I have a big resistance line near that 434 mark I mentioned earlier too for the daily chart that we will watch. Overall 440 is the max resistance line that if broken could signal bull markets back on. \n\nA couple other things to watch is VIX is currently below 30 at 29.42. If we see the VIX start to climb back up at all that’s gonna be a sign we are headed lower again. \n\nOIL is down to $105/barrel again so that will be important to watch too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKEY supports today- \n\n429.5 \uf0e0 428.7 \uf0e0428.8 \uf0e0 428 \uf0e0 427.5 \uf0e0 426.9 \uf0e0 426.4 \uf0e0 425.6 \uf0e0 424. 8 \uf0e0 423.5 \n\n\\-0.5%= 423.4\n\n\\-1%=421.2\n\n\\-1.5%=319\n\n\\-2%= 417\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKey Resistance today\n\n430.6 \uf0e0 431.2 \uf0e0 431.9 \uf0e0 433.2 \uf0e0 434.2 (upper limit of the channel) \n\n0.5%= 427.6\n\n1%= 429.7\n\n1.5%= 431.8\n\n2%= 434\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember do not go into today biased of what way we are going to go.

Remember about 70% of the trades are done by algorithms; they move the markets.  I do not think a downtrend this strong will continue forever but in the short term... this is now a strong indicator.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Graphing Calculator](https://preview.redd.it/zbek7vc6sym81.png?width=1703&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9d262038a846f2b2a31c9a32c5bc66acb6d2995)\n\nThis week I just changed the formulas so they automatically calculate the least squares line of regression and plot the offsetted lines from standard deviations.  There is lots of room to move downward on Monday opening since Friday closed at roughly the mean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Normal Distribution](https://preview.redd.it/yrify1vpsym81.png?width=1849&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bee35df9529badbad716c2b7e2e8b9bb078a3a5)\n\nThese formulas will calculate and shade a normal distribution curve for the statistically predicted price of SPY from the days past December 31st.  Normal distribution really does occur everywhere.  On the left side d = 73 which is the day of 3/14.  This is the statistically predicted price for SPY for Monday market close.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Calculation for area of an inequality under normal distribution curve](https://preview.redd.it/w6qprtj7tym81.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=465f38af3fd8c4400990b9feb5fac64a2eb71e5e)\n\nFrom this model there is a 79.7% that SPY will close below 428 on Monday; good news to put holders and volatility ETF holders!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/empxx8bnuym81.png?width=1497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4edfae8679fab8b18cbe045b8ca17564dca41c3)\n\nThis is an extremely important indicator.  When the 50 day moving average crosses the 200 day moving average this is known as a death cross.  While the death cross is not 100% accurate it has predicted the worst bear markets: 1929, 1938, 1974, and 2008.  There are funds that will not buy any stocks that have the 50 day moving average below the 200 day moving average because they will statistically underperform the overall market.  This is definitely something to pay attention to, it will be a major event signaling a bear market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[US Bonds Friday Close](https://preview.redd.it/0xjlc4txvym81.png?width=319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1bee5ab9a72f41582685d8650e1e12f8e2e5049)\n\n[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/dyreyc1ewym81.png?width=1493&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7abbda83409990e8b1209e27f391c9f84a4ff2e)\n\nNot much to say about bonds, short terms are soaring and long terms are flat.  The yield curve is flattening... yes it is happening.  An inverted yield curve has predicted EVERY recession.  This is as close to a perfect indicator that you can get.  If this happens, the week the yield curve inverts will be insane, every fund will be panic selling.  Keep a close eye on bonds in the upcoming weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Federal Reserve Calendar](https://preview.redd.it/dgqqyx5jtym81.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9edb3ee2f4ccf88242a4868801f0d35591798167)\n\nLots of investors will be watching when the Fed has a meeting Tuesday and Wednesday followed by an announcement.

Many people are being misled by the federal reserve's reports.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dj3ldtjsozm81.png?width=1218&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=caf6be31bcab815af153808737b8342894ed3890\n\n**Predictions**\n\nWe are in for another rough week in the markets.  Even though there was 4 red days last week in the markets, nothing will be getting better.  The demand for commodities is increasing and the supply is only decreasing: last week Russia officially banned the export of wheat.  Although there was a correction there is is still an overall uptrend in most commodities.  \n\nThe stochastics are currently about 30 on SPY, not completely in the oversold range so there can still be strong selling pressure.  I think the support zone at 409 will be easily broken and then some buyers will start to step back in.\n\nTwo more major indicators are the death cross and yield curve.  When the death cross happens I am sure investors will panic but remember it is not a 100% guaranteed indicator.  The yield curve is a 100% indicator though.  3 year versus 10 year is flat.  If the 3 month yield exceeds the 10 year yield then that is almost a 100% indicator that there will be a recession in the next one to two years.\n\nThe important event happening this week is the FOMC meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.  There will be an announcement at 2pm EST Wednesday make sure to watch for this.  As seen in the chart above 97% of investors are confident there will be a 25bp rate hike.  A couple of weeks ago I was confident the Fed would mention a 50bp hike in their testimony in front of Congress, it was mentioned but not talked about as much as I thought.  While many people think they need to do a 50bp rate hike they only think the Fed will do a 25bp rate hike since anything major could cause the markets to crash.  I want there to be a 50bp rate hike but the chance of this actually happening is minimal.  A 25bp rate hike is almost guaranteed here so no crazy volatility unless they decide to do a 50bp rate hike... If they do a 50bp rate hike then yeah: everything will crash.\n\nMany investors will watch bad news and do more in depth research so I am expecting Monday to be bearish, I bought UVXY Thursday and Friday and am holding over the weekend.  Tuesday the selling pressure will settle and buyers will probably take control.  Wednesday though, the rate hike decision will be watched very closely, I am not expecting the market to be green if they announce a 25bp hike.  There is really nothing bullish about that, the short term economy is just being propped up at the expense of the long term economy, more people are starting to realize that now.  Thursday and Friday the selling pressure will continue unless some peace treaty is made by Russia, this is unlikely though, Putin does not want to give up.  This Friday is the third Friday of the month and it will be a \\*quad witching event\\* basically lots of futures and options contracts expire and the market will pullback in anticipation for this; it will be a very volatile day.  \n\n \\* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more \n\n \n\n**TLDR**\n\nMonday🐻Tuesday🐂Wednesday🐻(⬛🦢if 50bp)Thursday🐻Friday 🐻, Support\\~409, Be ready for Wednesday!\n\n**I will respond to every comment!**", 'label': -1}, {'text': '2008 Called again.

The crazy thing that if you were to block all the white noise, all the Biden speech pumps, all the Russia bs, all the pumps and dumps intraday and you looked at this chart here. You would see that in almost 14 hours of trading there was only ONE 15 minute candle closed above the 8 ema. That is some hella bearish movement. You could have entered a put at market open and not touched it till end of day and easily made 100-200% gains on your puts. However, of course intraday we have so much going on we can not be so objective. \n\nTechnical wise today had you just watch the 8 ema you would have been sitting pretty. But of course we have the classic sell off as Biden speaks followed by a big rally which we saw attempt to happen two times today. We also saw the VIX peak near 30.4 at 955am this morning and continue to fall as SPY continued to fall, which was interesting to watch. However, we saw around 240pm the VIX go on a massive fear run breaking its 8 ema and peaking at 31.04 before market closed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zu6t15tdavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9721c49c51293f43bc48b26eb1754aeb0aa99fe8\n\n if you follow me and were in the live chat today intraday around noon I mentioned SPY was testing its upward channel support and that if it broke the 424 support we would be breaking the channel and should see a big run down which can to happen exactly as I had mentioned. That’s why watching not only intraday but daily trends is so important. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/es3skajfavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4637043c677b12d440eac3e4c580a7926fb496f3\n\n Which leaves us with this very nice looking bear channel that I also mentioned to keep an eye on. We have officially hit the upper resistance with that pre-market move to 433 and now naturally it makes sense to see it test the support line which puts SPY next week testing support levels between 400 and 410. If you remember last time SPY hit its new lower low of 410 it immediately sky rocketed back up… we very well may see some of that same movement happen next week.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnix2xigavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aad74cba66f0f82571a4740043329461c42c893e\n\nAs mentioned this morning and intraday in the live what does this chart show you? Does it show you a bull chart or a massive bear chart? We are 100% without a doubt in a bear market. Even CNBC said we are super close to triggering their “extreme bear market” indicator that hasn’t hit since 2008 I guess. \n\nTodays intraday movement and this daily candle finish was very important to me and very foretelling for what is going to happen next week. We have a bearish engulfing candle on the daily, we once again after breaking the daily 8 ema failed to close the candle above it. Looking at the EMAs the daily 8 and daily 20ema are damn near falling straight vertical down now we have such a bearish sentiment on the chart. The daily 50 ema closed in even closed to the daily 200 ema leaving only $3.5 left before the death cross happens… We could see this death cross play out as early as Friday next week if we see some similar movement as this week and fail to make any significant upward movement. \n\nIf you remember next week we have the oh so awaited first rate hike and FOMC meeting on Wednesday. It is going to be VERY interesting to see not only what JPOW has to say but what he chooses to do with the rate hike. Remember Thursday markets despite expected CPI did not like it and sold off still. I think next week we are going to see some fireworks on Wednesday and Thursday. IF I was a betting man its going to be the same thing as last week on Wednesday when JPOW testified we saw a fuck you green day followed by 4 very red days. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nThis was not my best week but overall a good week. I was attempting a few different strategies and pushing myself past my comfort zone and it did not pay off. I look forward to getting back to my tried and true method that works out well for me. But overall it was a good week. \n\nI made 15 trades and had 8 green and 7 red. \n\nGoal of the week is $2500/ week or $500/ day\n\nI managed to net a profit of $1100 this week averaging a terrible 4% on the trades I made. \n\nNext week I need to get back on my game and back to the strategy that’s never failed me. No more pushing hard or making risk trades for no reason at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow did you guys do with the 10% challenge?', 'label': -1}, {'text': "From 10k to loser to 50k challenge using SPY 0DTE option trading - Update 5I had previously mentioned I am going to continue posting this thread everyday. I missed few days. Here is my update. I had some losers and winners. Definitely the winners wining the trades. My account wasn't doing much going deep downtrend until started doing 0DTE options. My target was $100 a day. Recently I was able to make $300 to $500 every day consistently.  I use to get upset and down when my trade goes against. Also wait too much to cut down my loses. \n\n1. Nowadays learnt to trade without emotion (not completely , but improved). \n2. This helped me to quickly jump from losing trade to cut loss immediately, and catchup with trends. Now I learnt not to fight the market and let it drive my trading plan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some of my wins. I am up $2k for Feb and $1k for March. Now everything is big both loss and wins. Win I lose, i immediately counter trade and exit with profit there by always maintaining profit for the day. I exceed 300% to 500% my daily $100 profit. \n\nI didn't trade on the missing days in the screenshot due to my work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think? Does this methodology work ?

I know I was a victim of the mornings bullshit and got burnt by the exchanges freezing. Overall next to the GME issue that was the most BS ive seen in a while. Anyone watching and trading this morning saw the massive red candle come in breaking all the supports only to magically have the exchanges “freeze” and brokerages across the markets freeze and magically SPY goes on a nice bull run. \n\nBut atlas no matter the tricks and fuckery whoever was trying to play it was not enough and we still saw another afternoon of selling. Despite the clear red day we did see the bulls end of day save this from getting anymore bloodier than it really could have if it had free rain. \n\nVolume today was another very interesting thing I have been watching for a few weeks. Overall the volume on the day was around 95 million total which is still about 25 mil lower than usual. The last three trading days of SPY have all been below 100mil when the average is up around 120 mil currently. \n\nIt appears China today announced that they are going on some lockdowns for a new? Covid variant which is about the only explanation I have for why VIX opened near 31 dipped to a low of 30 around market open only to go on an absolute tear up to its peak of 33 around 245pm when we saw the bulls finally take some control. It will be interesting to see how the markets react to this throughout the week.\n\nTomorrow we have the first day of FOMC meeting, however, as far as I can tell (outside of leaks) there will be no information released until 2pm on WEDNESDAY. Tomorrow is the first day of the “meeting” from what I understand but markets should not get any news. Currentlly the first rate hike is scheduled to be released at 2pm Wednesday.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0f0bm9kc2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122e09056cbf1c9627dad6e8ad7843e3b9aa0826\n\nWhat do you see when you looked at this? I see an overall big bear channel down with some intra-levels but they are all going down. This leaves room for us to trade up or down depending on the day. However, the overall trend continues since January to be downward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jfrdj1jd2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f52f792738300375b5e7715adb8703898e670f51\n\nTomorrow my expected range if we have a bullish day would be to “level up” near 422-423. IF SPY can get above that 423 mark it could continue to the next “level up” around 428-430. \n\nHowever, If SPY has another red day tomorrow the next level down is 405 to 408. If that level fails we will finally breach into the upper 300s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ix6pbce2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c357daf0e592f9d8f1ced2a0b820ae5e73d20758\n\nThe futures show a similar trend line. Its major support is near 4082. If it can break above 4176 over night it could see a nice gap up. However a rejection at the last diagonal dotted resistance line could result in quiet the bearish move tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58qg4uif2gn81.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=814c28bb8482a52e72f70fbea86dc2c1a5ae1fb2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvn8e72g2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4603fb9582caa2d05b09ea40b1820435e9bc612\n\nOn the daily chart the first picture I highly two important candles and then the next pic is unaltered to allow you to see it more clearly… what do you see here? I see two nearly identical candles and see a double bottom. Its not perfect double bottom but for a daily chart 3/8= 415.12 and today a low of 415.79… well that’s a pretty dang close double bottom to me. It almost reminds me of the inverse of the two green double top candles from February 2nd and 9th. \n\nWhat do I think that means? Well personaly with that long upper wic from the morning I would NOT be surprised to see a nice gap up for futures over night and/ or a green day tomorrow. My anticipation also will be the markets running up SPY tomorrow in anticipation of FOMC being good and only a 0.25bps rate hike. I feel like lately markets love to run this up end of the day. We also finished above the midchannel support line today too, however, continuing to wic above the daily 8 ema but finishing BELOW it really is a very bearish sign. The 8 and 20 EMA are darn near 30 degree angles straight down and the 50 ema is now only $3 from the 200 EMA to complete the allusive death cross. \n\nFor bulls to get a leg up tomorrow we need to see Futures hold its green over night and we need to see the VIX continue its end of the day sell off and breach 31 and inevitably 30. At this range a nice unwinding of the VIX would lead to a very green day. Its very possible tomorrow is green. I don’t know about 3% green but it very well could be nice and green. \n\nBears need to see futures lose its current green, the vix continue back up near 33 and break this double bottom at 415. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\nUnfortunately got burnt by the market wise freeze of exchanges this morning so took a pretty big hit there. Thankfully I had only risked about 20% of my normal allotted per option amount. After that I decided to stay with my 20% of my allotted amount and I also continued to test a new indicator out. Overall still learning how it ticks but overall I am a fan. I also have no idea what happened to my TOS at the end of the day (even TOS help desk says they didn’t see it on their side) but around 3pm I was in a call. I watched on my TOS desktop a put open up randomly. My call then close out red before my eyes and the put then close out before my eyes red too. I asked TOS about it and they didn’t really have much to see about it. I have no idea what happened and have no explanation for it and neither did they. The only thing I noticed is the 15min candle had a massive quick dip and recovery at the same time. Overall not a fan. But none the less made 10 trades for 50% green and 50% red. For a total gain of 1% and a small loss. I do really need to get back to my normal one trade a day and now that I feel a little more comfortable with this new indicator I will continue to watch it. I got too cocky with it today for sure and over traded my gains away at the end of the day which is a cardinal sin. But overall tomorrow is a new day! \n\nI will take a small loss (which really my put was up 15% before exchanges froze this morning and ended up closing it down around 20% by time TOS “adjusted it” for me and the fanthom put I didn’t even enter along with the call randomly closing out for me (and no im not on margin) overall not a bad day today). Everyday is a lesson. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember- DM me if youd like to stay in touch after April 2nd as these will no longer be posted daily...', 'label': 1}, {'text': '🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA - Wednesday March 16, 2022 (0dte Scalpers Delight)[🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA - Monday March 14, 2022 (0dte Scalpers Delight)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/td84xj/i_spy_ta_monday_march_14_2022_0dte_scalpers/)\n\n# Economic Calendar - March 16, 2022\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vq1ril2gmn81.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27171649dacb21aed7f5f338e10e34d65deacf26\n\n# SPY - March 16 - Technical Analysis\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kr9d2di4gmn81.png?width=1382&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=691b03edca7dcc9b5b13a4da98a452844228a3dd\n\n* Nice bounce bulls!\n\nLevels\n\n* Lose 422.03 - 421.42 and look for 418.00 - 415.87 - 414.73 - 412.83\n* Break 426.28 - 427.16 and look for 428.69\n* Break 428.69 and look for 431.39 - 433.45 - 436.49 - 438.28\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cchdn407gmn81.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75cb30c5b53044762909a406d282549e35c98395\n\nNotes:\n\n* Remember, Mid to long-term bearish under 440.

Either way, massive moves incoming, beginning this or next week. A few charts help visualize this.**\n\nOK, so here is a useful nugget of technical analysis on S&amp;P500 that should shed some light on what is about to happen next...\n\nUnless you\'ve been living under the icesheet of Europa, you should be well aware by now that this market... all of it, across the planet, although it\'s the US we\'re concerned with here... is heading for a "Day After Tomorrow", Tsunami-sized crash and depression that hasn\'t been seen since 1929. The only real question right now, is:\n\nIs this it? Has this downturn marked the peak and were standing on the edge of the cliff, our center of gravity already leaning over? or is there still a last bump, a final ramp, to this madness, before it all collapses like a wet sandcastle?\n\nTime will tell, but for speculation purposes, there are some neat technical indicators we might like to take a look at if we decide to speculate the moves to come.\n\nI will use three S&amp;P500 E-Mini Futures charts to illustrate this.\n\nOf note, is the simplicity of the charts to follow. The best chart work is simple and suggestive, not some convoluted overlap of schizoid drawings which could be mistaken for attempts to invoke some esotheric spirits.\n\nTo that end, the features of interest in these charts are as follows:\n\n• 2 × Fibonacci Extentions, different scales\n\n• Quad Witching Dates\n\n• Death Cross\n\n• Main Trendlines of this cycle\n\n• 3-Standard-Deviation Bollinger Bands (they just sit there)\n\nChart 1 - Trendlines: [IMAGE](https://i.ibb.co/0hsXYXV/20220314-225401.png)\n\nYou\'ll notice the 3 trendlines originate at the origin points of the main bull markets of the last decade. This  nested fractal-like feature is pretty common with bull runs, on any scale. As the length of the runs compresses, their amplitude increases.\n\nYou\'ll also notice a big Fibonacci going from the \'07 peak, which is almost the same as the \'00 peak, to the \'09 trough. Bull runs love to peak around the x.618 or x.236 extensions, where \'x\' is usually between 1 and 5, and this market seems to be no exception, after pinball-ing through all key levels.\n\nNOTE: The 4 main trendlines neatly converge to a point. Also, the point coincides with the 5.236 retracement.\n\nChart 2: [IMAGE](https://i.ibb.co/0hsXYXV/20220314-225401.png)\n\nThe Fibonacci in "Chart 1" goes from the Feb2020 peak to the Mar2020 trough, and follows the ensuing run as it plays pinball against the key levels on to new highs. \n\nFor those still unaware of the meaning of a Quad Witching, it is when a bunch of option expiration dates overlap, spawning all sorts of complexities and ramifications. They affect volatility and often price too.\n\nNOTE: The current downturn has found support on the 1.618 extension level. The 2.618 level also coincides with the intersection of the main trendlines, just like the 5.236 in the other chart.\n\nChart 3: [IMAGE](https://i.ibb.co/G7fSVNN/20220314-221834.png)\n\nThis chart is a close-up of the first one. Upon this closer inspection, you can see the current All-Time-High neatly hitting the 4.618 level, which is one of the most popular peak levels for fractal bull runs like this one.\n\nYou can also see, the dreaded "Death Cross" forming. That is, the 50-Day Moving Average piercing the 200DMA to the downside. Now... here\'s the deal with these crosses. They can be fakeouts, from both sides. When a market is indecided such as this one, and the cross is young, it can flip back around and continue what it was doing before. This could be one of those times, or it could be a glaring signal that this bread is toast.\n\nNOTE: Current peak at 4.618, a still-young Death-Cross, 5.236 Fib level matches trendline convergence.\n\nAnd finally, the FOMC meeting is about to happen not far from Friday\'s Quad-Witching.\n\nThere are so many stars aligned here, it\'s a Conga Line of stars. Clearly, there is a massive amount of pent up energy in this market... with an upcoming Quad-Witching and an FOMC meeting, after 2 months of bouncing into a descending wedge, with the 50DMA having just touched the 200DMA... there are 2 main directions this can go:\n\nDOWN - the 4.618 Fib was the peak, the market never retests that trendline and it all collapses at breakneck speed. Your DOOM Puts will finally pay if you cash them right and you\'ve witnessed the beginning of the end.\n\nUP - after FOMC/QuadWithcing, the market does one last quick and furious run towards the 5.236/2.618/Trendline-Convergence area, a.k.a "The Moon", with some bounces along the way at key levels, and while it might not hit it exactly, it would be a ramp to behold... before detaching it\'s boosters, hovering for a moment followed by a fiery re-entry and ballistic fall: see the "DOWN" paragraph above.\n\nWhichever way it goes, a lot is pointing towards it going big. If you buy option strategies to take advantage of the big move, regardless of direction, you might make big bucks on the fall, or pretty good bucks on the rise. And if it goes up, then you can quite confidently put it all in DOOM strategies, since the only way from there is down, and that should pay even bigger bucks.\n\nThis post by no means covers the "whole" picture. It just presents a neat juxtaposition of technical signals and their translation.', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Elon became Ilona :) What now with $TSLA??[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'ATVI and MSFT?[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Bought SPY options at the bottom.

You be the judge… \n\nStatistically speaking if spy opens red there is roughly an greater than 80% chance that SPY will also close red that day. Today we see that statistics are not always correct and why we have to put our biases behind us and focus on what the intraday chart shows us. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t29y4wywd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fe03fe32bd95699cd83928143af59bb99b1163e\n\nLooking at this intraday chart you can see that as soon as market opened the bulls came out swinging and they never really let off the throttle till market closes. Looking at the chart now you can clearly see that bulls broke out, rejected the important 437 resistance, regained steam and then blasted through resistance to new highs. I wasn’t trading most of the day but I like many got burnt thinking the morning rip was the fake out and that we would sell off the rest of the day. Statistically speaking more times than not we would have been correct. Also it really didn’t seem like it wanted to break through that oh so important 437 resistance. \n\nBulls managed to brake this all the way to 441.07 to close here out today for a modest 1.25% gain. However, after hours saw an immediate sell off and is currently sitting between -0.55 to -0.6% right now and using the 8 ema as resistance instead of support. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmhvdfcyd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c11447d825a6cdb86d84ff82de06da5e359f2d\n\nLooking at my daily chart I can clearly see it is time to make a new channel and see if we can predict where spy is going to go next! Overall the way yesterdays candle finished as a hanging man I am beyond impressed the bulls pushed it green today. Interestingly enough today is technically a hanging man candle also. However, when I look at January 28th, 31st, February 1st and 2nd we actually are seeing a very similar setup today to that. That was the last time there was more than 3 consecutive green candles in a row in over 3 months. Today marks only the second time since December 21st that SPY has managed to have three green days in a row. \n\nIt is also noted that SPY has NOT closed a candle ABOVE the daily 50 ema since February 9th and has only closed one above it (including today) 3 times in over two months. \n\nThis is also the first FULL candle closed ABOVE the daily 20 ema since February 9th and before that it was on January 4th.\n\nNow let me show you a few things I am watching for and seeing on this daily chart as we actually have a few different setups forming. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1nhvmvzd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57521c5ea38ad089f76e609166469e79a1b1aa8d\n\nFirst up we have this green channel here which COULD be the start of the bull run… This channel allows us to move as high as the daily 100 ema before we would see much resistance which is around 445 currently. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lixzmov0e1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac86c49e56b8d49e652298c545a7675507100d0\n\nNext we have the red bear market channel. This channel would allow SPY to gap up as high as 445-446 (right around the daily 100 EMA also) before it would see any real resistance. \n\nNow one other thing that I notice looking at todays chart and why its actually very peculiar to me that we hit 441 intraday and rejected so hard downward after hours is that the previous highest high before today was also right at 441. We are currently seeing a double double top at 441 that would if it holds send us crashing back down. Interestingly enough we also have a double bottom near 415. Which if this plays out correctly we could be seeing the following movements to confirm a massive inverse head and shoulder pattern…\n\n 410 \uf0e0 441 \uf0e0 415 \uf0e0 441 \uf0e0 410?\n\nIf we continue to sell off it would be very interesting if we were to retest 410 from this level if bulls fail to regain strength. This pattern actually played out the exact same back in January/ February. 420 \uf0e0 458 \uf0e0 444 \uf0e0 458 \uf0e0 410. \n\nHistory is not predictive of the future. However, it would be quite amazing to see one month+ longer inverse head and shoulders pattern lead right into another. Overall If spy fails to break higher than 441 tomorrow or beginning of next week I would be watching for the retest of 410 before we go any higher. However, if we manage to get a candle closed at or above 445 I am going to be convinced the bull run is back on (for now). \n\nI am also watching for the possibility of a future 441 double top too. Currently on that path spy is on if it were to dip into next week but effectively trade sideways (much like it did end of January for its double top) we could beginning of April see a triple top at 441 that would surely cause quite the downside. We definitely have some big levels to watch out for tomorrow and next week. \n\nTomorrow is the quad witching day which historically in a BULL market results in a usually pretty red day. However, in a bear market im not quite sure what to expect. Chart wise I would be pretty impressed with a 4th red day but the fact that Mondays low was 415.79 and we closed today at 441.07 means that SPY from Mondays low to todays high has gone up over 5.9%. That is an absolute massive gain for one week. Especially when you factor in that spy up until today had not closed back to back green candles in over a month. But for reference the last time SPY had 4 back to back days of green in a row end of January/ beginning of February spy managed to gain over 7.1% in 4 days. \n\nThe one thing we can guaranteed is that we do not know exactly what the market is going to do and we can only be along for the ride. Many of you probably are thinking its time to enter puts because surely its going to go back down. But the one thing we have to remember is that stocks historically go up not down. So in the end as much as this is clearly a bear market we are in… in the end we are fighting the overall bigger bull trend. \n\nI am staring at this chart looking for confirmation one way or the other and honestly I cant say I have any. If we break 445 I think that is a bigger signal we are back for the bull run but if we were to get back under 420 range I would think we see 400 before we see 460. In the end today was a massive break for the bulls BUT if you remember back to January. February when we had the massive “V” recovery from 420 the channel resistance we were in broke yet we continued lower. Again history doesn’t repeat itself but I am seeing quite a few bear case scenarios vs bull scenarios right now. \n\nThe best thing the bulls do have going for them though is that the VIX is still historically higher than usual sitting at 26. Most of the “fear” around FOMC, rate hikes, war, inflation, etc. is truly (from the horses mouth JPOW himself) PRICED IN. So unless something wild and new happens we should see the VIX attempt to lower itself down into the teens again. The natural easing of fear and the VIX returning to its average below 20 should allow SPY to head back near 450-460s. \n\nI do ponder if we see a return to a short lived bull run before the next CPI, FOMC and Rate hike. \n\nThis weeks FOMC minutes release on April 7th. And the next FOMC meeting is April 27th. \n\nThe next CPI is not until April 12th\n\nWith all that bulls do have some freedom for the next few weeks to unleash the beast again. Tomororw will be an interesting day with the quad witching though but Monday should start the “new trend.” \n\nRemember- DM if you wanna keep getting these updates after April 2nd as they will no longer be posted to reddit.', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'SPY may reach $500 by end of this yearEven if this week was a bull trap and SPY goes back to $420 next week, as long as the war ends soon, it is possible for SPY to surge to $500 later this year. Ukraine war will be much more transitory compared to inflation. As long as there is no WW3, we can safely assume that the economic damage to US via sanctions will be small, and most of the negative effect is towards higher inflation due to higher oil price.\n\nHence, I think that the long-term main factor that decides whether the stock market will surge, flat, or fall is inflation and how the Fed\'s policy pans out to bring the inflation back to 2%. \n\nOn Wednesday, the Fed made it clear that there would be 7 rate hikes this year. This was different from their previous attitude where they chose not to tell how many rate hikes planned for next 2 to 3 years. This previous "indifferent" attitude resulted in uncertainties perceived by the market. Will the Fed increase the rate hike by 2% overnight? Will the Fed have 10+ rate hikes this year? Market hates uncertainties, and thus the initial crash before the war crash a month ago.\n\nAs the Fed now makes it clear how many rate hikes will be introduced in next 2 to 3 years, this sent the signal to the market that the Fed knows how to combat inflation (at least the market is more confident with the Fed now). Otherwise, the Fed will not tell us how many rate hikes to introduce. This also implies that recession is less likely to happen as the Fed now appears to know what they are doing compared to 2 months ago.\n\nInflation is not necessarily bad for stock market. Inflation means higher rates, which means higher profits for value stocks. Think companies like Walmart who can charge higher price for their goods. For most of growth stocks, it is not good due to reduced cash flow. However, for big tech companies like Apple and Amazon, they can also charge higher price for their products (iPhone, Prime membership fee), which neutralizes the effect. With the big tech companies constitute higher precentage of the stock market, this means that higher rates do not necessarily mean bad things to the stock market. Furthermore, many big tech companies have their own program of buying shares back, which serves as a catalyst of higher stock price in future. This is in addition to the fact that, in long-term, stock price will increase with inflation (if goods price increases, so should the stock price as long as the number of shares are around the same).\n\nTo sum up, it is likely that SPY will surge during later part of the year, and may even surpass $500 and reach $500. April can still be a bear month, but September, October, November and December are much more likely bull months.', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Lost it all mostly on spy options', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'WISH free delivery is matching and beating the prices of Amzn.

But here we are yet again another day and some fuckery afoot. Its getting a little exhausting at this point. But what we saw today was essentially JPOW reiterate that he is very hawkish (the exact same stand point he had at the testimony 2 or 3 weeks ago and pretty much the same stand point last Wednesday) but for some reason today the markets decided it was time to panic. We saw about a dip from 444.56 all the way down to 440.68 before we finally saw a recovery end of day back up to 444.39 to close. SPY closed at -0.03% which technically makes it a red day but overall really didn’t feel very red. \n\nThe morning movement of SPY was very up and down also with some very unexpected trend reversals.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4l0dtvjqto81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f46c74acd81e23e897fd4c03d60b53a57d56f21\n\nGoing into tomorrow it will be Important to keey an eye on the intraday high around 446 and the lows near 441. Those should be key support and resistance to watch as the day essentially while bearish ended in a sideways manner. \n\nWhat truly is impressive is that the VIX opened at 25.14 and closed at 23.54, dropping a full $2 without SPY moving upward and still finishing green. The VIX compared to SPY very much so under-reacted to the JPOW news today. \n\nTo be honest I actually don’t care if SPY goes all the way back to 480 or if it goes to 400. What I really just want is for SPY to go back to its normal trends where you can actually play it how it looks and not get burnt by a big green dildo candle or a big fat red fuck you candle without any warning. The overall movement does not matter but when the intraday movement is nothing but fuckery it is quite annoying. Volume wise we once again failed to meet the average turning in only 88.3 million for yet again another extremely low volume day. This is the lowest volume day since February 16th. The first sub 90mil day in over a month. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tv8nxtilqto81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500bb803be1eba98e0190710628684d58c6229a7\n\nNow the daily does tell a bit of a deeper story…. \n\nIt’s a little hard to tell in this pic because of the post market blue dotted line but the daily finished in a DOJI which COULD signal a reversal. Which after 4 massive red days would make sense… I mentioned Friday and this morning that today and tomorrow were going to be very telling of where this is going over the next few weeks. Unfortunately we didn’t get much direction. But the fact that JPOW once again told the market hey you idiots shits really bad and we really shouldn’t be bull running and these are the reasons why and the market said oh shit you are right for like an hour then said nah fuck that we actually are good to go for the bullrun says a lot… IF what JPOW said today isn’t going to tank the market then honestly I don’t really know what is going to stop it from going back to 460 outside of maybe a surprised rate hike or the next inflation number being 5x worse or something crazy. This market just doesn’t wanna be held down anymore. \n\nToday though we did close BELOW the 100 EMA at 445.08 (but broke it at one point in the morning). We also found support at the 50 EMA at 440.58 when we had the massive sell off. The fact that this didn’t break through the 50 EMA is quite bull telling if you ask me. But tomorrows finish will be telling. Looking at this chart currently IF we break through the 100 EMA over night at all or tomorrow intraday I would not be surprised to see this push towards 458 to retest the double top from February by the end of the week. IF we can break through 458 there really is nothing stopping this from 470 or 480 within the next few weeks. It wouldn’t shock me one bit to see with the VIX continuing to fall and this continuing to run this break through 458 in the next few days and inevitably retouch 470s by April.\n\nThe only thing I forsee to bring this down is either the US stepping into the physical war itself in Russia, Russia attacking the US, or MAYBE once the next CPI data drops and the next FOMC happens and we hit a recession officially. But  honestly we may be so recovered by then that we just have a minor dip back down 460 from 470 or 480 and return to the top after its priced in. \n\nOverall I would NOT encourage ANYONE to bet against the market right now. My tone may change tomorrow if by some miracle bears can get this to gap down and close BELOW the daily 200 ema at 438.18 and the daily 50 ema at 440.58. Until then im riding the 8ema wave bull train to the top. \n\nAs JPOW once said “Fuck your Puts.” \n\n  \nDM me if youd like to stay in touch after April 2nd are i will no longer be posting daily TA or pre market posts on here...', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Nancy Pelosi Buys $5,000,000 of $TSLA[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'TSLA 5K -&gt; 23K in a day yolo.

The one thing that the bulls do have going for them is that they managed to get this candle to close back ABOVE the daily 100 ema which is a bullish trend. But what I am seeing set up currently is a similar trend we had back in February where we did a massive run up. Broke down. Broke back up for a double top at 458 and then crashed even lower. Granted this time is only over a 3 day period its very possible with only one red candle in 8 days (granted one was technically a -0.03% day). That is a whole lot of green in a very short period of time. I believe apple currently is at its eighth green day. \n\nIf bulls can get this to open green tomorrow we may see a run towards the resistance lines at 458 where we will see if SPY will triple top or break through cleanly. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5t211ojk6fp81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bd2dcb6781b99d46f88b2097ffe0550d40536a9\n\nThe weekly candle going into tomorrow is very similar as if we manage to gap up to 458 and hold there at close for the week we will actually see a perfect triple top at 458 (January 31 and February 7th week).\n\nIf the bulls manage to get a green day tomorrow to finish the week they truly need to close ABOVE 458 to keep the bull run energy going. Bears need to see a close tomorrow below 445.5 (daily 100 ema and weekly 20 ema) to bring some bearish momentum into next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\nI despite having to hold my calls through quite a bit of red at the end of the day managed to make 5 trades today and all 5 were green with anywhere from 10-20% profits. I did have one over night put lotto that closed down 15%. Overall not a bad day at all. Looking for one more strong day tomorrow.

The case for LONG GME.First off, congrats to everyone that made bank from that price action this week. It has been a refreshing change from all of the loss porn. Even though my tits remain jacked for the rest of the week and the short term momentum, I want to discuss my thoughts on GME, why it is a great LONG play based on fundamentals, and why I think it will be the next TSLA. \n\nFirst, these two companies have some essential similarities for my comparison\n\n1. They have a huge retail following and remarkably loyal/enthusiastic investor base\n2. Charismatic, passionate, and incredibly successful leaders in Cohen and Elon\n3. The companies are developing new tech to be leaders in a mostly untapped market \n\nMy comparison on the fundamental side will focus on current day GME as compared to TSLA in 2017.\n\nTSLA (2017)                  GME (today)\n\nMarket cap                           71b                                    10b               \n\nShare Price                            70                                      141\n\nRevenue                                 11b                                    6.1b\n\nEPS                                       -2.37                                    -5.25\n\nCurrent Assets                       6.5b                                    2.6b\n\nCurrent Liabilities                 7.6b                                    1.3b\n\nLong term debt                     11.6b                                  40m (yes, million)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, looking at these numbers they are not perfect, but I think the same thing ultimately held TSLA back that will hold GME back from a fundamental perspective. This being EPS. Both companies proving to grow revenue, but not turning profit or creating cash flow. From a balance sheet perspective, GME is actually quite a bit better here with 2:1 assets:liabilities and essentially no long term debt. The cash burn for GME is a result of their investment into new streams of revenue and will hopefully start to show improvement in regard to EPS with NFT marketplace opening. This same lack of cash flow generation held back TSLA for years, but they did eventually turn positive in 2020 and guess what happened to the share price? Yep, rocket emojis.\n\nTesla share price went from 130 in Jan, 2020 to 793 in Jan, 2021 (adjusted price for splits)\n\nI think long term, if you believe in the NFT marketplace as a good move for the business of GME (as I do), we could see similar price action with institutional adoption and closed short positions over time. \n\nA couple of other things GME has working in their favor:\n\n1. Insiders really believe. Insider buys 104k shares the last 2 days, sells 743 shares (form 4 filing)\n2. Shrinking float. 76m shares - 13.6m(18% insiders) - 21.3m(28% institutions) - 10m (DRS) = **31.1m**\n\nTLDR: GME is the next TSLA (in terms of stock performance). Once NFT marketplace starts to generate revenue and EPS turns positive we will see a TSLA-style run. \n\nDisclosure: 343 shares at 153 average\n\nI like the stock', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'This means sell NVDA, right?', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'When I decided to buy into tsla options right after they opened their german factory without setting a stop loss….well the loss dosnt stop😁', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'If at first you don’t succeed.

It was mentioned that meta’s “metaverse” concept has been laughed off by a few people\n\n2. The overwhelming success of oculus  is catalyst \n\nOn that note I thought it might be worth clarifying what is “the metaverse”\n\nWhat we consider “the metaverse” is essentially and world you can interact socially in. World of Warcraft is a metaverse, as is Fortnite as is the oculus spaces meta is creating. Collectively these all make up “the metaverse” the conocensus is that we should gravitate towards a technology where the metaverse is like the web, and each “space” is like a website we can visit. \n\nFacebooks interpretation is just one facet of this.\n\nWhy is this important? \n\nBecause as mentioned above and on the call, 80% of the vr market is oculus, and by extension meta. So even if their metaverse concept is a flop, it will probably be their devices were connecting with. And they will figure out how to monetize that.\n\n\nOn that note, why is occulus dominating vr? For two reasons, they are taking apples approach to this space.\n\nSteam is like google. They have an open platform, that manufacturers can tap into, htc, Hp, etc. these are just hardware executions to steams vr platform. Like google/android, it’s fragmented with each manufacturer having different variants of vr, each with different tracking technologies. From a development perspective, this is going yo be a nightmare.\n\nOcculus on the other hand, not only connects to steam, is easy to use and setup, and most importantly, is the only headset WITH ITS OWN PLATFORM \n\nOcculus has its own “home”, own works apps, own events, own social spaces, and I guarantee you these will all integrate.\n\nSo until apple enters the space, meta is the apple of vr', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'In 2015, both $AMZN and $BABA wanted to acquire ContextLogic ($WISH) for $10 billion, but we’re rejected.

Bearish at 439 and below. Want to see us close above 450 next week for a few days to be bullish.\n* If we get near 448-450, I want to see if buyers come in - if they do, I believe we will finally get the full measure by the close. If they don’t, then I’ll look to 445-444.\n* All else fails just trust the levels and measured moves, trimming or taking full profit at half measures and leaving runners for full measured moves.\n* The 1-Day Netfow looks bearish so this does give me pause to increase positions at the open, especially if we have a substantial gap up open.\n* Daily RSI - bullish. 65 min RSI - bullish - near overbought. 15 min.

But SPY opened the week at 444.34, seeing an intraweek low of 440.68 and closed the week at 452.69 just $0.19 below its high of 452.98. \n\nWe will start at the weekly candle and work our way back. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmqwa9oaimp81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5999884fdfa51c2325eca379d5767858804f6a65\n\nnote- the grey and pink channels are from the daily chart and do not exactly correlate over to the weekly chart very well so they are off a little but on the daily you will see their true placements. \n\nOn SPY weekly candle the week saw a mild 1.84% gain after the monsterous 5.82% gain last week. Spy now from last weeks low has gone from 415.79 as a low to a high of 452.98. That is a 2 week total gain of 8.9% total in two weeks. That is a ton of green movement. A few things to note on this chart going into next week to watch. \n\nThe candle did finish as a VERY strong and solid hanging man candle. The hanging man candle is the opposite of a hammer candle. The hanging man candle COULD assume a reversal of trend going into next week. \n\nanother thing to keep an eye on is the 20day EMA which lies now at 445.73. This is the first weekly candle closes ABOVE the 20 ema in 10 weeks. That is a very long time to be below the weekly 20 ema which generally trades as support not resistance. With this candle perched above the 20ema weekly we could see the potential for a bullish continuation. There is also a case to be made that SPY may attempt to test that 20 ema support intraweek before going any higher. \n\nA keep resistance I will be watching (that I also expected to test today… and we may have tested had we not had the massive sell off with the VIX reaction to the Saudi attack) is 458. The level of 458 is currently set up as a double top and very well could play out as a triple top IF spy fails to break any daily candle above 458. \n\nVolume wise this week closed out at 385million total volume which is the lowest volume week since the week of December 27th. The interesting thing about that is that is was the last bullish week before spy saw a massive sell off that we are currently recovering from. \n\nWeek candle wise: \n\nBears would want to see the 20 ema at 445.73 and then the weekly 8 ema at 441.97 test as support and see that support fail with an closure of the week back BELOW the weekly 20 ema at minimum but preferably below the weekly 8 ema. \n\nBulls would need to see a green week that tests 445.73 (weekly 20 ema) as support and confirms it before breaking cleanly through 458 with a weekly closure above 460 to prevent a double top from the week of January 18th which had a high of 460. Bulls also need to see a green continuation candle and avoid any sort of bearishly engulfing candle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qq09rscimp81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67a48e3227e4084b642646170760b00ff31fb4bf\n\nNow looking at the daily as I had mentioned this one you can clearly see the channels much better and the overall trend. \n\nThis week we technically had two red candles Wednesday which finished down 1.29% and then Monday which finished down 0.003% and as a doji. So technically we had three green days and two red days this week but as you can see on the chart due to Mondays price action it actually is represented as four green and one red. \n\nMonday was the day the markets over-reacted mid-day to JPOW letting us know a 0.5bps rate hike as for sure going to happen, that they may do additional 0.5bps rate hikes and that they could do some outside of the meetings if needed. The odd thing about the way the market reacted was 1. Everything he said was already mentioned the previous week at FOMC and during his Wednesday testimony yet the markets rallied like crazy. He really did not say anything out of line or that I would call surprising. Yet the markets acted like it was the first time they heard JPOW be hawkish… it was odd. And 2. Despite the clear over reaction that sent SPY from its highs of 446 to 441 which is an impressive 1.1% drop intraday the markets still rallied from 441 to 444.39 to close the day at -0.03%. \n\nThe markets at this point truly do not seem to care about anything that is going on anymore. Much like today they very dramatically over-reacted to the Saudi oil field attack but still recovered and matched the intraday high before close after being down a pretty significant amount. \n\nWednesday was the only true red day this week managing a measily -1.29% close for the day. After 6 green candles myself and many though that could be the start of the dip but SPY had other places closing out another two green candles. \n\nDaily wise I mentioned on Wednesday that a close below the 100 EMA was bearish but SPY managed to get back above the 100 ema to close two candles above the 100 EMA for the first time since January 14th. \n\nIntraday volume has been extremely low with Monday being the highest volume at 107 million and the lowest on Thursday at 65 million. The weekly volume average this week was 77million per day compared to 111 million per day last week. That’s a 34million volume per day difference which is insane considering that’s half the volume we saw in one day on Thursday. \n\nI am not really sure where the volume went someone said this week at one point that it was about 60-80% retail trading this week and 20-40% institutions trading. I have two theories. Either institutions are still sitting in cash fearing a recession and a true crash OR they are waiting until SPY hits just the right point and they are going to pull the rug one last time before we see a new high. \n\nThe lower volume is a concern not so much because once volume dramatically decreased we saw a dramatic bullrun but because what that increased volume can do to spy. This can either get very bloody or very green real fast if the volume returns to its normal. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wz1m0f3fimp81.png?width=852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe3cea8c5d615fa35df30ee3d0004d1721bdddb3\n\nSPY has found itself inside a nice little bullish channel here that it does not seem to want to fall out of. This channel gives spy an opportunity to see 460 as a high Monday or if it were to break through the critical 450 level it could test support down near 444. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x711xuxfimp81.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47b5ef2e83c7b8130e8441e0bb665f01f9e4082c\n\nIf bulls want to see this see 460 and test the double top it needs a clear break through and holding of the 453 resistance line it traded under today intraday. \n\nThe true winner of this week was the VIX and Apple though. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2c8mvjhimp81.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a04f0ab1318576cdc0fcf49a9a3c13af1b582ac8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcv6xemiimp81.png?width=846&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c46789559fc66ddbedac3b23bc8aa505304957c0\n\nIf you look at apple it has also been on an impressive tear from a low on March 15th of 150.38 to a high today of 175.28 giving it a beyond wild nine green daily candles in a row. I am not positive but I am sure this is close to some sort of record. Apple has gone up a total of 16.5% in 9 trading days and is only 4.3% of its ATH of 182.94.\n\nWhy am I mentioning Apple in a SPY TA post? Well here is why. Apple currently makes up 6.94% of the total weight of Spy. The last time we saw our massive dip in January and had the crazy bullish recovery back then guess who also led the charge then? You guessed it Apple. \n\nOn January 24th SPY hit is low and reached its top on February 9th before retracing to its low on February 24th. Guess what days apple hit its low, high and low…. January 24th \uf0e0 February 9th \uf0e0 March 15th. \n\nUntil we see apple close a true red day and it loses its momentum to the upside SPY is not going to see any downside. Currently Apple daily MACD is still very bullish and its RSI is only at 64 which if you look back to its peak in December it will easily run &gt;70. I watch apple intraday to guide where SPY is going. They don’t usually go far from eachother. I have even began picking up a few apple options here and there this week too depending on who is lagging. \n\nNow the VIX saw an absolutely impressive week opening at 25.14, with a intra week high of 25.14, a low of 20.8 today where it also closed. The Vix over the last 3 week has gone from a high of 37.52 all the way down to todays close at 20.8. That’s a 45% decrease in 3 weeks. So what does that mean? That means over the last three weeks we have seen a peak in fear in the markets which obviously coincides with the low in the market. Looking back to this last year VIX has run from an average of about 15 to 20 depending on the time frame. That means we are near the mean reversion of the VIX. \n\nTo me this means that SPY will not be pulled along the way it has been the last week. The VIX intraday for this entire week has been the one in charge. Just like today we saw the massive VIX spike intraday but as soon as the VIX settled and started to trend back down Spy settled and started to trend back up and that’s when I knew I could capitalize on some calls. \n\nThe VIX (fear) seems pretty low and numb at this point and I really do not see anything that is going to re-spook it the way it was in January and February. With the wildcards of inflation, fed movements, war, oil, etc. all priced in at this point we really cant expect anything to disrupt the VIX. Both “fear” reactions this week (jpow Monday and then Saudi oil field attack today) were handled intraday and the fear disappeared very quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\nWeekly profit goal= $2500\n\nactual profit goal= $1025 \n\n(I took a big loss Monday on some perfectly badly timed calls as JPOW tanked the market and had to grind my way back to green).\n\nI made 25 trades this week total (23 spy, 2 apple)\n\nApple- 2 for 2. Average%= 16%\n\nSpy- 17 for 25, Average%= 3%\n\ntotal average% per trade= 5% this week \n\nBig loss%= 70% on a 0dte call that went against me \n\nBiggest win%= 50% on some 0dte calls bought near the bottom today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall- it was a very good week for me. I did not make my profit goal but If I erased the one call I had went very heavy on Monday I would have beat my weekly profit goal. This week I continued to perfect my strategy and continued to test not only my patience but my trust in my indicators and strategy. Early in the week due to the JPOW dump I did get slightly discouraged but no one could have predicted that (though its also a risk to trade when a speaker is going to take like JPOW or Biden) and I should have had a proper stop loss on. This was a good week for me and today I finished on a very strong note. I had 2 days this week where I had no red trades all day also which is always great. \n\nI hope everyone has a great weekend and look forward to seeing you Monday! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember- Next Friday April 1st I will no longer be posting daily TA and pre market TA to reddit.

Thankfully, the bears finally around 1015am were able to get some footing but it was not until about 1230 that we finally saw the bears really dig in. With the 459.2 double top the bears were able to sink SPY all the way to 456.47 for the low of the day during power hour. I had called yesterday that we were going to have a red day and a gap fill and we came within about 70 cents of filling the gap.

The VIX too traded within a very tight range all afternoon from 19.6 to 19.2 before it finally saw a massive pop to 20.51 during power hour and then elevatored down to a close at 19.34. With the VIX being so low the wild swings and moves are going to be less impressive. The best plays I had today were all when the VIX made a big move. That is the best way to play this low volume currently. \n\nApple FINALLY saw a red day! It snapped its longest green streak since 2003 which was 11 days. Closing down a very modest -0.66%. Apple looked incredibly weak intraday today and very much so struggled to get through most resistance. \n\nThe Daily chart looks like we are riding the 8ema wave all the way to ATH. With the gap essentially being filled SPY like I said can easily go back on a bull run tomorrow. With the current channel the max I see is 470 and the lowest I would suspect is 450. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/25mhm5t48mq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb6dd3f2ba49549fd4eec787d06b63377d9e7156\n\nWith March ended which has essentially been a recovery month it will be interesting to see if the start of April Friday will bring a retrace of if we will continue the bullrun.

Last time we had volume of 121mil/ day and movement like this was the start of the bear market back in January. Could April showers bring sorrows and bear arrows? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpal863gctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae1558cc49d0e8655d53d5f897a50cf7307e92f3\n\nDespite the essentially flat pre-market we saw quickly entering the intraday this morning we saw spy establish a bear trend with candles below the 8ema. And that is pretty much where we stayed all day. We saw a nice dip to 456.6 at open that led to a recovery to 458.76 around 11am. That morning recovery should have been everyone signal to buy puts for the end of the day as all the signs of a dip fill to 455.91 and potentially even a dip near 454 were clear and present around mid day. However, due to the wild reversals we have had the last two weeks we had to play it safely and unfortunately missed out on some incredible gains. \n\nHowever, end of the day brought the fire works. Start of power hour we saw the shake out fake rip to 457.36 before we saw spy jump off a cliff with one of the wildest power hours ive seen that took us to a low of 451.16 before finally closing at 451.63. That is an incredible 1.37% dip in one hour. Considering our intraday range was $2.7 till about 245pm the fact that SPY covered over $3 in an hour is quite impressive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzz5hzygctq81.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88eae5847685c5a055a4c5717c596f8bf3fc86d1\n\nNow that we have potentially “peaked” we will look at the downside levels that have not been in play for almost 3 weeks. \n\nThe next levels down support wise (major supports) are 450 \uf0e0 446 \uf0e0 443 \uf0e0 436\n\nThe next major resistance will be 459.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurrently we are also see two channels… the dotted channel that I refer to as the levels which support is intraday tomorrow would be 450 and resistance would be 458.5.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k7hb4p3ictq81.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1dad19dca701e7b16c851b91635d1ab90d34a0e\n\nThe solid line downward channel puts resistance at 455 and support down near 447. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/seizqg1jctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69717795b1650eb859a89204d9457801c930a7f0\n\nThe daily candle close today is quite telling if you ask me. It closed BELOW the daily 8ema for the first time Since March 15th which you guessed it was the first green day of this massive two week long bull run we just went on. While the candle body is only below the 8ema if bears can gap this down tomorrow we just may see a full close below the 8ema which is very bearish. \n\nAlso of note is the fact that this is the first candle closed below fully below the mid point of the grey channel we have been trading within. That tells me the bulls finally lost momentum today. Support of the channel tomorrow would be at 452.5 any movement below that and we have officially broken the bull channel. That means bulls have to gap this up tomorrow and keep her green all day. \n\nThis is also the first back to back red days since the March 14th bottom. \n\nTodays volume at 122mil was the highest volume since you guessed it March 14th. Which that candle volume was 144mil and started the incredible bullrun we just went on. \n\nWith a new month starting tomorrow and monthly expire that took place today, along with the massive end of day sell off there is a very real possibility that the bear market dead cat bounce is being confirmed and we will now start pushing back to 420 range. \n\nAs much as I would like to tell everyone go buy 30dte puts and youll be rich… I don’t trust anyone at all. I don’t trust the MM not to run this back to ATH next week. The worst part about this bullrun we just had the last 2 weeks is that I will not be fully convinced of a bear market dead cat bounce until its too late to even capitalize on it properly. \n\nHowever, once the bears (if they truly are back in control) can get SPY back under the daily 200 ema at 439.33 I will then be convinced we are going to retest the 410-420 lows. However, at that point I would be waiting for a 410 retest. If 410 was to hold and see a convincing double bottom I would be looking for some 2-3year LEAPS to purchase. If 410 was to break I would still fully expect a dip near 380. \n\nThe VIX intraday saw a spike to 21.5 after being pretty flat all day between 19.5 and 20.5. With the vix closed above 20.5 And spy well below where it was the last time VIX was at 20.5 if the vix continues to trend back up we just might see some more downside. As always all eyes on the VIX. It did not lead us astray today or at all this week.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bl5ee9kctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72e4409b6f0832658d580b1f8048c90bfeedfe01\n\nAs you guys know I strongly believe Apple is a gateway into what SPY will do and their correlation is very strong. Looking at the daily chart of Apple we see a similar set up. It closed a candle below the mid support of the channel for the first time in 2 week and saw now back to back red days for the first time in two weeks. Apple however was able to keep its close above the daily 8ema at 173.55. I fully anticipate apple to start heading back down and break its daily 8ema tomorrow too. With the RSI now in a downtrend I will be keeping all my eyes on Apple tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% daily challenge-\n\nToday was another great day of trading in the server. I probably had one of the best weeks I have had since January so far. \n\nI made 4 total trades today. \n\nA 0dte put at open for 10% gain. \n\nA 0dte put that I had to hold all the way to -50% before I was finally able to average down and secure a 20% gain on. \n\nA 4dte put during power hour that I tapped for 25% which of course ran to well over 100% at close. But after greed killed my gains on Monday and obviously no one knowing we were going to dump that far (I fully expected 454 but not 451…) I had to secure profits and then I was out of buying power by that time. \n\nI also played a 8dte Apple put that I was going to hold over night (had bought around 230pm before it broke its support) but ended up selling before close for 45% gain. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall another great trading day. \n\nGoing into tomorrow im currently sitting just under 3x my weekly profit goal and I am going to be very patient and not erase all my gains this week. Being a Friday I have no idea what to expect but the last few Fridays have been quite great trading days for me. I do know the last week every morning trading session has been nothing but chop and tight $2-$3 ranges before we finally make a massive end of day move. I will be patient and I will make my moves count. After 3 days in a row of nearly making my weekly profits in one day im gonna stay humble and not get greedy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRemember greedy and cockiness kills.', 'label': 1}, {'text': '4/1/22 SPY (apple) weekly TA4-1-22 SPY Weekly TA\n\nDid you guys get tricked?

Do you remember when a small mid day pullback was healthy? And that once we pulled back we would just rest and continue the trend the rest of the day? Pepperidge farm remembers…. The morning trend was one of the nicest bear trends I have seen since January, unfortunately it did not turn out well for those of us who were bearish today.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c8fk2hn5o0r81.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fba8e9354ecfee5eaf6d58b49cb9f1cec9fc669\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/90udttq6o0r81.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a158b24bca0b3ddbb7fd4fb45bc8610c091dcfcb\n\nWhen we zoom out the one thing I am seeing is  a very clear peak back on March 29th and we have failed to make a new high four days in a row now and at the same time have made a new low each day. While we just had a massive 2 weeks of bull run it is too soon still to tell if we are in a new bear channel but currently there is quite the case to make that we are starting our new leg down. It just is not as aggressive as we saw back in January. \n\nToday we broke below one of the major support “levels” of 450.5 We traded underneath it for quite a while too before we finally saw a true end of day reversal and finished between two levels. We are currently between the 450 and 456 levels but we are also trading within a downward channel that was established when we peaked on March 29th. \n\nThis downward channel gives us a support of 447 and 454. Intraday there was a very heavy indication that we were going to see a bigger dip today and possibly see 445, however, around 115pm the bears managed to turn arguably one of the clearest bear channels ive ever seen with not a single candle or even candle body closed about the 15min 8ema from 845am until 130pm. That is a very strong trend that I am still beyond impressed that the bulls were able to true reverse which used to be rare, but is becoming uncomfortably more common. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n19rl078o0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31df256ba1c279467564fc5b831bf22d42f3b51b\n\nWill need to see how ES opens Sunday night and how pre-market looks Monday morning but that afternoon run up seems to have heated up the RSI and we now have a MACD sell signal. The last candle of the day was also very impressive by the fact that we once again had massive sell pressure and downward momentum along with the VIX trending back up steadily only for it to slam the breaks on and do a 180 about face and elevator up. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/myjm8539o0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6e542f3729ac5d3488f1c9da09024b2c9e676ac\n\nLooking at the VIX it seemed any time we neared 21 we would about face. It is the same with VIX at 19 it doesn’t seem to want to break below it. \n\nThe VIX is now trending for the last 4 days between 18.9 and 20.6 as its key “support” and key “resistance” areas. Mind you VIX doesn’t really have those but its just the levels the VIX seems to bounce between. Historically over the last year 16 to 21.6 has been the happy range that VIX bounces between. As I had mentioned earlier in the week the VIX is what we need to be trading currently as the VIX has been the only hints to these end of day sell offs. It will be very interesting to see next week where we head. \n\nLooking at Apple it actually showed arguably more weakness initially then SPY did. Apple pre-market levels were much lower then SPY. However, Apple was able to find support near 172 intraday and seemed to like trading around the 172.8 to 173.5 level most of the day before the end of day pop. \n\nAs you can see by the chart next to VIX, Apple too is in a massive downward trend where it is seeing lower highs and lower lows each day now since March 30th. \n\nI wanna touch on Apples daily chart first and then we will get into SPY daily and weekly chart and start seeing some key levels headed into next week!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/httmjjzao0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7376495d302a315872a057f1c6bfef180db14ccb\n\nApple has by all means topped out and peaked. The most recent high of 179.61 on March 30th which also happened to be its first red day in 12 days by all means looks like it could see the next leg down. \n\nApple today broke its bullish channel that was established two weeks ago on the start of its run up. To me that is something to watch going into next week for sure. Apple also flirted with its daily 8ema of 173.72 for a long part of the day and for most of the day it was resistance before the end of day fat green candle gapped it up over the 8ema to close what really was a bearish day to appear bullish. \n\nThe red channel is now void (left it on there for visualization) and the grey is what ia m watching as in play now. The support line of it is VERY strong with three points but the upper is still being tested. I will be watching Apple if the bull momentum is still there to pop to a peak of 179.2 next week. However, what I really will be anticipating based off the RSI and the MACD on the daily I fully expect a retrace to test at minimum support of the daily 20 ema at 169.58. We very well could see a dip as low as the daily 100ema at 164.71 before it finds some real support. This bullrun of Apple was impressive but very unnatural pattern wise. \n\nToday also is the first time since March 17th that a candle has broken below the 8ma. Intraday and later this week I had seen quite a bit of weakness from Apple.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xb80vjgco0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d759271b509ef2466f8a1576c2a5a3eaac644388\n\nNow taking a look at SPY. Today we too saw a very similar (not surprised) move of Apple breaking its current two week bull run channel to the downside. The grey channel is now null and we will look to see if SPY can find some downside next week or not. Today was the first time since March 16th that  SPY was able to get a candle wic below the daily 8ema support line.\n\nThursday and today were the first time in two weeks that SPY actually looked “weak.” I still do not know how they managed to get this green end of day today but I did not have the strength it once had. \n\nThe RSI is at 57 on the daily and the MACD is well above the zero line and ready to cross over to sell for the first time since March 15th. But this would be the first cross over to sell above the signal line since January 5th which we all know what happened after that…\n\nThe daily 8ema of SPY actually acted as support and resistance all day with a majority of it acting as resistance. I was fairly confident we would at minimum see a candle body below the 8ema but the MM had other plans. However, there is a very good chance that we see further downside. In general when spy breaks a wick over a major support/ resistance such as the 8ema, 20ema, 100ema, or 200 ema the next candle or shortly after will be below it. The daily chart finally looks bearish to me. \n\nIntraday had we been able to keep the bearish momentum up I fully believe we would have seen 444-446 range which is the Daily 100 (446.42), daily 20 (445.62), Daily 50 (444.42) and then lastly the daily 200 ema is all the way down at 439.46). \n\nTarget wise for next week IF the bull momentum continues we will look to establish the next resistance point of the orange channel which would be around a max of 460 for Monday. I also have a resistance line from the March 29th/ 30th tops which I will be watching at the 458 level if Monday ends up being bullish. \n\nIf the bears are able to get the momentum going (and sustain it… they have had the momentum realistically a few times these last two weeks but the bulls have refused to let them capitalize on it) I will look for that 444-446 range Monday. We have not see a -2% day in almost a month with the reddest day being a very moderate -1.3% back on March 11th. While I would never play it position wise we are “due” in my opinion for a fairly bearish day.  Though with the vix now trending down in the 20s we may not get these massively green or red days we grew so accustom to. In the last two weeks the average close +/-  has been 0.75 to 1.25%. The only real massive volatility I have seen in the last two weeks was on Thursday during power hour where we dipped 1.4% total. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yv0wre7eo0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dbfb6cbbe8bebb15114dcee0d955f5844d434f8\n\nTaking a look at the weekly chart for SPY now shows a bit of a different story compared to the daily. We are actually still within the bullish grey channel established back the week of March 7th. This channel gives the weekly range of a high of 480 (yes that’s ATH) and a low of 450… if we are obeying the channel. 450 is interesting to me because that acutually is right around the lows of today intraday with us reaching almost 449 for a short period of time. \n\nWeekly volume wise we did see an increase from last week with volume coming in total around 445.5 mil. This is still slightly below the previous 2 months average but about 70mil higher than last week.\n\nThe weekly actually shows a much better downward channel in my opinion then the daily does. The orange channel would give us a high of 460 for the week and a mid channel point of 431 with the current bottom of the channel being down near 404 which is also the weekly 100 EMA. \n\nThe one thing I am watching VERY closely on this weekly chart is how the candle finished. IT finished in a gravestone doji candle. Which is actually a very bearish indicator. Now while its not perfect and could be nothing I look back at the weekly and almost everytime we have seen a doji candle formed on the weekly (week of Feb 28th, Jan 10th, Nov 15th) we have seen downside the next week. The gravestone doji make it even more of a bearish omen. However, the one bullish thing I am seeing on the weekly is the MACD. That macd is sitting on the zero line and looks poised to cross over to a buy. Of course a MACD that’s near crossing can false cross, or can kiss but never truly cross so it should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nOverall I really believe in a bearish week coming up. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tiypiufo0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd2af2a57a48ac76ca61278c226f9a7d60c77af1\n\nWith the 10year and 2 year (-0.06) officially closed inverted and the 3yr and 5yr inverting last week We are seeing the signs of an impending recession. While the market seems to have over the last two weeks shrugged off anything and everything inflation or economy related I think its only a matter of time before they finally start to realize how bad things are and start their panic. \n\nNext week economic and fed wise we have the FOMC minutes on Wednesday at 2pm, jobless claims on Thursday along with consumer credit. \n\nWhile not a big news or data week we have the looming CPI coming out on April 12 which is less than two weeks away and I suspect it to become a talking point again soon. With gas prices and inflation they way they are I suspect the number is going to be much worse than expected and we will see a the markets begin to react and price things in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started the week off on a big L due to greed and a trend reversal. I was lucky enough to have a great 3 days of trading which put me well above my weekly profit goal so I went very heavy wisk on today. I failed to secure some profits that I definitely should have as I truly believed in the bear trend today and was fully expecting the next big move down. However, it just never came. After taking profits well before the massive sell off Thursday with no buying power left I decided despite being up nearly 50% at one point on positions to hold and not take profits as I believe like SPY used to that we would see a small retrace before breaking the intraday low. I did not think the bulls would actually end today green like they did. \n\nWith that being said lets take a look at me weekly progress and monthly being that the month is now over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly profit goal- $2500\n\nActual profit- $3200\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAverage % gains per trade= 3%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekly win rate- 68%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonthly profit goal- $10,000\n\nActual profit- $6,700 (just shy of my goal… which looking back is very good considering I spent the first 2 weeks of the month establishing a new part of my strategy and learning a new indicator) \n\nLooking back it does hurt knowing had I not gotten greedy Monday and had I not gone full risk on today I would have succeeded my monthly goal. But sometimes we do have to risk some to see bigger profits. In moderation and not blowing up an account it can be worth while. But in the end profits will always be king\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonthly win rate- 63%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall it really was a great month that had some great lessons.', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'TSLA $1170C 4/14.

This has been the most hectic first quarter for the market in a long time.  I don't have any major events to speculate on this week, I am now looking at the bond markets. \n\nI remember talking about the bond markets 2 months ago saying an inverted yield curve could come in the next 5 months.  The bond markets are moving very fast however, this is not a good sign and the yield curve actually inverted last week with a 7.5bp negative spread in 10Y and 2Y government bonds.  \n\nIn 2001 when the yield curve inverted this was just about at the top of the market, when the yield curve inverted in 2008 there was still another 8 months before the market crashed.  This shows us that after the yield curve inverts it is only the final speculators that will prop up the market.  In 2001 it was obvious to many big funds that these trash companies were going for an IPO and then running 1000%, they knew that there was a bubble so when the yield curve inverted it was only a short period of time that this speculation crashed.  In 2008 though, the bubble was less obvious to many retail investors and funds, everyone was sure that the housing market was very solid and would forever be.  This caused many people to continue buying even through the obvious signs of a recession (the yield curve inverting).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2esx9y1cj5r81.png?width=1156&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=174fde35e21b44ac9431af1b9ac3d3b02cf85793\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hjnlfjdj5r81.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca999f349064faf40057b32eac2d49f1123dfa2f\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not dumb like we all think they are, they are just saying as much positive news as they possible can to try to keep a positive sentiment in the markets.

If you were a marketing firm that paid Meta for advertising prior to it's previous earnings, would you continue spending the same amount if not more given what previous earnings released said? What about how the company has gone about rectifying the loss let alone preventing further loss?  To top that is the opportunity cost you sacrifice sticking around when you could go to Tik Tok or other up and growing platforms.

How about when you're taking a shit?

I mean think about it.  If advertising is moving it's money away from Meta now, imagine what it will be once it finds out that what the real mean-time exposure to ads would be? It'd be limited to the evening and a very selective audience while competing against free platforms who offer exposure to ads all day long which means LOTS of revenue.\n\nBottom line is this:\n\nZuck is a fraud.  He is the male equivalent to Elizabeth Homes.  The path this firm has moved too makes complete sense because Zuck never designed Facebook.  He stole the idea.

This is the absolute last thing you'd want to be doing in a high inflation environment with commodities surging and the demand for USD dwindling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5e1nhsi20vr81.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5643c3e471743792e54903156ec9efe15cfcf9e\n\nI wrote about the *Doom Vortex* and the dangers of sanctions which are symbolic, and about the coming shortages, immigration crisis, and exploitation by China as a non-sanctioned nation here.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tv7ym1/doom\\_vortex/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tv7ym1/doom_vortex/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nA bear market is defined as any decline of 20% or more in the general market. We’ve had 9 such declines since 1950. After a 20% decline (which we have not had yet), the average bear market lasts 289 days.\n\nUltimately it will be taxes that have to be raised. Remember you’re the ones that pay taxes, not corporations or billionaires who can lever debt. Corporations made up 7% of federal tax receipts last year. That means corporate taxes are ripe to get hiked along with digital asset taxes, capital gains taxes, etcetera. That’s likely where the GOP makes huge inroads with voters going into our elections this fall. Speaking of politics, anybody see France’s far-right candidate *Marine Le Pen’s* sudden surge in the polls against Macron? An insane upset in that election would send absolute shockwaves through the EU that you cannot imagine. If that happened only a month into the Ukraine War when the biggest fallout from it (shortages, immigration surge, inflation) has not been fully absorbed, it’s difficult to imagine an EU that would survive intact because I watched the last time immigration in an economy of plenty brought Brexit and a new political class to Europe. Imagine immigration 5x as bad in an economy of shortages, and rolling blackouts.\n\nThis is natural gas futures. This isn't going to last long before things stop wobbling and start breaking:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3i6izl30vr81.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c6bae5e2e49d52e8c703381e6bf30765c7ac7ec\n\nSo what does this mean for markets? It means a wipe-out. It means the type of capitulation that proffers generational buying opportunities. I see it as more than this, in fact; I see it as a redistribution of wealth, blood on the streets style. My nephew who uses FBA to sell products on Amazon with margins of about $1, has already had to raise the product price 20% to make the same amount of money but his sales volume has plummeted. If he continued selling at the previous price, he'd be losing money with each item. That's an anecdotal and seemingly irrelevant example, but my point is that the weakest will get squeezed first and our economy IS NOT designed for oil over $95. The entire thing has adapted around certain energy input costs like our evolutionary biology has oxygen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0ekwoj40vr81.jpg?width=1160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=661bcbb29604eaedd66ffe9e0d7380346618b31e\n\nLook at the trucker tender reject index above... This is up exponentially from last year. This reading is actually worse than every recession on record.\n\nThis all sets the stage for the coming food crisis late summer into fall which I talked about in the Doom Vortex post. It'll destabilize the Middle East, and send a deadly wave of immigration into Turkey and Western Europe. Fertilizer price index:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/isrm8bj50vr81.jpg?width=920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3aba31e0e672ba0d25214d69fd007eeb631dc73\n\nWe'll look back and see that the bear market started in in November 2021, and was confirmed in April (or May) of 2022 with the 20% down breach. Then we'll look back and see the recession started early in 2022.\n\nMy prediction is that the Turkish Lira continues its hyper-inflationary moves, and goes bust in the next 12 months. That's dangerous because of the inbound immigration issues nobody is seeing play out. They'll be left with the choices of either moving closer towards China (an emerging debtor nation who can proffer money and commodities), or to sacrifice their children at the IMF altar, hoping its SDR (special drawing rights) has enough inputs to float them past outrageous fortune. Either way, they'll be giving away huge concessions. Or they can choose the digital gold pathway, which will cause all types of trouble early, and then later because digital gold over a long enough time period completely demonetizes the political class; but it makes sovereign citizens and the scarcity in the money leads to an abundance of everything else, meaning it would be great for the people at large. Turkey is a strategically located country in geographical terms, and has an enormous manufacturing base. The former is why it's so valuable to China, so EU would be willing to overspend to keep them in the fold, putting evermore pressure on the Euro. Money machine go *brrrrr*.\n\nLastly here's a thought experiment with an anecdotal example:\n\nAssume that Starbucks made an NFT large latté. This NFT latté was exchangeable for a real latté at any Starbucks location. That latté is $5. But now assume that this NFT latté could be held on any non-custodial wallet in the world, which you could spend it from, and Apple integrated spending of such tokenized securities from ApplePay. Ok, but now assume there are DeFi marketplaces for these, meaning I can swap that latte for a Big Mac, some doughnuts, or sell it for digital gold, HODL it, or gift it, take a loan on it, etcetera. Assume any trade of such tokenized securities cost less than a penny, settled instantly, and moved at the speed of light. Why would anybody hold USD (and thusly stablecoins) when they could hold these globally? Why not hold the NFTs instead ? Because they'll keep pace with inflation. Assume the network these all travel on can eliminate the 4% charged by Amex, Visa etcetera. That chargebacks dropped 50%. Refunds were instant. Settlement was instant. Global restrictions were gone. Liquidity could be acquired instantly, and it offered a revolutionary way to advertise like Facebook did a decade ago. That's the Lightning Network's future, and it's not good for banks, remittance, card processors, stablecoins, or paper money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[T\\]he above is the Weimar papiermark versus gold chart.

Well not a whole lot new honestly. All we have learned is that clearly JPOW are hawkish and ready to do another 0.5bps hike in May at the next meeting. We also learned that the previously doveish members are now even hawkish. \n\nSPY had a massive gap down at open today from 451 close all the way to 447.3 at open, which of course left a big gap on the daily chart. We know how SPY does not like to leave gaps too… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fpfvqc4k10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83bc89d145cfecdce94507165673aece3ae9233c\n\nIntraday despite the massively red pre-market and first big red candle SPY traded within a pretty tight range hovering around 445.5 from 945am to 130pm. We saw some green start to take off right before the minutes dropped. They got a lot of people with the fake out (me included) with running it all the way to 448.5 before they dropped it like its hot to 444.2 immediately after. From there I saw some of the craziest intraday swings in such a short period of time that I have ever seen. \n\nSpy dropped from 448.5 to a low of 443.47 (-1.1%, $5) rose to a high of 448.93 (+1.23%, $5.5) and then dipped to 445.32 (-0.8%, $3.5) and rose to 448 (+0.6%, $2.7) all within two hours of trading. That kind of volatility has not been seen in quite a long time. And being end of the day those who were brave enough to play 0dte made some incredible gains. I was able to recoup my losses plus 2x daily profit on one 0dte put on the initial -1.1% drop along with a few call plays to hit 6x daily profit in one day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/20qyh0vk10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c09e88166331fcec08f5b2056873f3ebf36339c\n\nIt is not surprising that we traded so close to 445.5 all day as that level is a key support of the Daily 20ema. It looked like when the minutes released we may see an aggressively red day and close below those key supports near the 440 level, however, 445 proved to be too strong to break through today. We also found out that 448 to 449 was major resistance too, as anytime we touched it end of day we immediately rejected down.\n\nWith a clear MACD sell and RSI trending downward now, favor to bears short term.\n\nOn the daily chart you can see we technically still have about an 89 cent gap from 448.93 to 449.82. Some could argue a gap this small is not important and will not be filled yet. One also may argue since its to the upside the push to close it now is not there as much as a gap below would be. Todays close and post market still have some bearish flavor to it. However, being able to close about the EMAs is fairly bullish. \n\nIntraday tomorrow and overnight we need to see if 1. The gap will be filled up to 449.82 and 2. If the daily 20ema (447.05), daily 100ema (446.7) and daily 50ema (445.2) is going to hold as support intraday tomorrow with the daily 50ema being the key support. If we were to get a bullish push tomorrow the daily 8ema at 451.37 will now come in to play as possible resistance. Failure for bulls to break and close above that again would be bearish. \n\nIf the bears were to get another true bear day I would suspect they will try to close near the 200ema at 439.82. That being the final support bulls have to hold before we would see 410-420 again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l3h71cpl10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c48bf03234f779648e9cdd5b12a2b0a89ce94e9b\n\nThe weekly candle is now coming in fairly bearish after a doji last week would hint to me that we very well could see some red next week also. Key support for bulls to hold would be the weekly 8ema at 444.88 and the weekly 20ema at 446.43. A close back below those would all be confirm a dip next week back near the weekly 50ema of 435.07. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe VIX had yet another massive day today from its low of 21.24 to its highest point of 24.78 ranging 16.6% of movement. This is three massive movement days for VIX in a row, yet we have not really seen a massive 2%+/- day for SPY yet. I believe tomorrow or Friday it is coming. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/859rj1dm10s81.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e1e339da7ce05cd1b42af887d81a063f4c23fa\n\nThe VIX key level to watch is 24.5 for the bears and 22 for the bulls. Now that the VIX is back ABOVE the average of 16.5 to 21.5 the bulls are in favor here as its is usually easier for VIX to unwind down with no new news than to go up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs87cr4n10s81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f73551d16c61e551142a0c8accadd5bff0a408b\n\nApple is looking similar to SPY on the daily chart with a clear MACD sell, and rsi at 53 trending down. Apple also has a pretty significant gap from 174.42 to 173.63 (0.45%, 0.79) on the daily chart. \n\nApple found support today at its daily 20ema which has not ben touched in over two weeks. \n\nApple bulls need a green day tomorrow to fill the gap up to a 174.42, however, they will need to break now resistance at the daily 8ema. \n\nApple bears will look for a close below the daily 20ema at 170.96. Bears will not need a very red day to accomplish this and their ultimate goal will be to get Apple below the daily 50ema at 168.44(only -2% from todays close) by end of the week. If bears can accomplish this 157 to 165 will be back in play. A close below the daily 100ema of 165.31 (-3.8% from close) while a very tough chore to accomplish in two days, it is not out of possibility for Apple depending how markets react. \n\nThe questions going into tomorrow is now that the markets have the full minutes from FOMC and nothing news wise until April 12th with the next CPI data…. Which I fully expect to be awful and another emergency/ surprise rate hike. With the markets now seeing the true hawkish fed and the new info about the balance sheets/ QT and rate hikes is the markets going to go back into full panic mode like January? Or will the markets too quickly price this in and return to full rally mode? \n\nI will be looking at tomorrows close and more importantly Fridays close for that clue. We have key supports and resistance that will give us a clue going into next week. \n\nI will be back on the sever all day tomorrow after taking the morning off for personal errands and I will also have a proper pre market post up around 9am tomorrow on the server for everyone. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a pretty good day for me.\n\nAs I said I was gone all morning and ended up not trading till about 1230. I entered some Apple and Spy puts around that time that I held till the first big green candle at 2pm and sold both for -50%. I then was able to grab a nice 80% 0dte play on the way down to recoup those loses + x2 my daily gains goalI had another 2dte -20% put that I played on the first recovery bounce when it faked us out red before ripping green (which is when I entered calls). I then played two different 2dte calls one for 40% and one for 30%. Overall being able to hit 6x my daily profit goal is incredible. I look to go into Thursday and Friday with low risk and being very conservative as I do not want to risk losing all these gains on silly plays. Friday if I have a good day tomorrow will look for a slightly higher risk on than usual though.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'AMD big opportunity possibly?

At 1045am we saw a massive green candle that took SPY all the way back to 450.63 at its high. I really still do not quite have a reason for this candle as there was no new at the time besides paypal/ tesla starting to mine which surely the markets wouldn’t have reacted to. However, the only thing is the VIX at the time saw a massive dive down from its highest peak at 22.34 straight down to 20.28 within two hours. Another massive 10% intraday move. VIX however, found support at 20.28 and ended up creeping it way back un to 21.57 before close which allowed SPY to fall all the way back down to 446.68 during the last 15 minutes and close at 447.57 for a -0.27% day. \n\nThe one thing I take away from this intraday movement today was that we clearly opened red and intended to be red based on the open price action and the end of day price action. Watching the red candles move (before the rip) vs. watching the green candles move (after the rip) showed quite the story. After the massive green candle up SPY sat n range of 450.63 to 448.5 for over 3.25 hours. However, most of that time was spend between 449.1 and 449.8 (1.5 hours of it). \n\nWhile SPY was able to touch 450.63 at its peak it was very clear that 1. 449.9 was massive resistance and very very heard for SPY to stay over for very long and 2. That 449.1 was very heavy support for SPY also. Going into the end of the day it almost looked like SPY would trade within that $0.50 range till close but eventually the bears stepped in, the vix rebounded up and we got a massive 10mil 15min candle reaching a low of 446.68 before settling at 447.57 for the day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95v7816wnes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e3e8e4fcea61407a59c774101c8748e8b72d393\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/76ppzkwwnes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99320dc48173bf1ad6cd5d521b73dcbe224baa76\n\n15min chart wise I am watching two channels. I labeled one as purple and one as red. The purple channel is the potential bull rally rest before more bull rally channel. Going into Monday that will give a total range of 453 to 446 to remain in the bullish channel. \n\nThe red bear channel which if you see has some black intra channel lines which really form a nice triple bear channel. We are currently trading in the upper part of that top tier of the triple channel and rejected resistance of it today when we hit 450.63. To remain in the bear channel top tier resistance gives a max of 448 and gives first support at 443 followed by 438 if we break into the middle tier of the channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6y56qixnes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33e64d65b64953786461671b1908b02a325d0816\n\nLooking at the daily channel SPY impressively managed to remain in both the overall bullish red channel and the bearish grey channel today. However, looking at the daily candles we saw a massive gap down that finished in a doji, followed by a green candle to fill the gap, followed by another red doji. I also am seeing the 2nd day in a row that the daily 8ema acted as hard resistance and that SPY failed to close above it. That is a pretty bearish finish in my opinion. In addition, we also saw a dip once again below the daily 20 ema at 447.25 and the 100ema at 446.76. We looked like we were just about to close under the daily 20ema which would have all but ensured a red Monday. \n\nHowever, this is now the third candle that has broken the 20/ 50 ema and that has closed completely under the daily 8ema. It appears it is only a mater of time before we see a close below the 20, 50 and 100 ema below 445.43 and test support at the daily 200ema of 439.98. I believe that day is going to be Monday. \n\nWe also are still seeing a daily MACD sell signal along with a slightly downward RSI at 52. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fetk2i2ynes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a419da17b2e005aadd75813539c147308c53b897\n\nWeekly chart wise it is a bit different than the daily chart. This one has three channels to watch as we find the true move to come. The key take away from this is the doji candle last week above the weekly 20 and 8ema proceeded by the red candle that broke the 8 and 20 ema. Mind you the candle today unfortunately did not close below the weekly 20ema at 446.53, which would have sealed a more confident red week. The candle breaking back below the 8/20 ema is a bearish omen. The weekly 8ema also failed to get above the 20ema this week due to the downside. Weekly chart wise we will look for the candle to break down below the 20ema at 446.53 and the 8ema at 445.11 with a goal of the 50ema at 435.11 as the next support test. \n\nFor me I will 100% be looking for a red open Monday and look for a retrace to 440 Monday. 445 should be pretty strong support as we have seen but after the massive rejection at 450 again today I believe the downside is being built and shape into the market. I also think markets are going to price in CPI data Monday in order to be able to run it up Tuesday if news is better than expected. There is a chance we could see 450-452 Monday and then CPI Tuesday will tank the market down to 440-445 but I give that about a 20% chance vs. the 80% chance I see 440-445 Monday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t33olsoynes81.png?width=852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=046478ba09cb3e0b263d12b2bf85f4eeaa41852a\n\nApple daily bull channel was once again broke today. This time in my opinion a nail in that bull run coffin. We are now looking at a new bear channel (yellow) for next week. With the 10 year yield running so much high today at 2.706 TECH looked extremely weak and will definitely struggle to get some bullish momentum until we see those trickle down. \n\nOne thing that we saw today with APPLE is that it failed after two full candles rejected the daily 8ema completely that today I failed to even break its daily 8ema and it closed under its daily 20 ema. I mentioned yesterday and on Wednesday in my TA that a close under the daily 20ema for Apple is exactly what the bears needed in order to see a potential downside of 165 to 168 this week coming up (daily 50 and daily 100ema). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og8sx17znes81.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=354ae4bf20fb8d43dc656cd1a08d8ab49137e2f2\n\nOn Apples weekly candle the one thing that I am watching for is that we technically are still in a weekly bull channel. The one thing though is that unless Apple can get an unbelievably impossible gap up to 176 it will break the grey bull channel and be within its red bear channel. \n\nThe weekly 8ema at 168.85 was not breached this week but we can with $0.50 of it. I suspect a proper test of that Monday and I suspect we could break below the weekly 8ema and even the weekly 20ema at 165.52. \n\nAs I mentioned in the daily section of apple I fully anticipate a drop and test of the 20 ema weekly support at 165.5 this week and that in and of itself will drag spy down too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5zi3v810oes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f33bd3ee93c97bdbd9c9c9d8513422476230af4\n\nQQQ had a very bearish week this week seeing this nice red bear channel forming. With a current MACD sell signal along with a falling RSI at 47 there is plenty of downside with tech. The 10 year treasury rising to the highest levels in decades is going to make it very hard for tech bulls to get any run this week. Monday range for the red bull channel puts us at 348.7 to 330 (unlimited downside). QQQ would need to see a red pre market that holds and does not allow for break of green otherwise we will be looking for a new channel come Monday to draw. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp2zdwu0oes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5f1adf517d000d2e51827a9cd27106f64c79e5\n\nQQQ weekly chart looks the most bearish of the three. I am seeing a reversal candle last week with a long top wick followed by a very red candle this week that failed to break last weeks highs. This candle broke through the weekly 20, 50 and 8 ema supports. With a close like this for the QQQ weekly candle I highly suspect that we could see a test as low as 320 to 330 next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vq57nki1oes81.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc4b964fec7d65af2c8fee89ed0a3c1672584c81\n\nThe VIX saw a wild swing of a week with beginning of the week lows ranging at 18.5 to the highest of 24.78 on Wednesday. The VIX closed the wek at 21.17 which is pretty much dead nuts middle of the high and low range. That 18.5 low of the VIX is some of the lowest we have seen SPY trade since January 13th. Being that the VIX attempted two times this week and two times last week to unravel below 18.5 but couldn’t says a lot about the markets fear. With the VIX closing this low at 21.17 there is plenty of room for the vix to rebound upward and cause a sell off this week coming up. \n\nHeading into next week we have only a four day week with Friday being good Friday. That means we will NOT have Friday expiations of options, however, we do have OPEX on Thursday for the Monthly options expiring. \n\nWith CPI data coming Tuesday morning. Despite everyone knowing its going to be terrible and I don’t really see how it can not be worse than expected due to inflation, the war, gas prices, covid, etc. My expectation is to see the market price in a terrible CPI Monday and Tuesday the markets will be free to rally if it is as expected or they will tank if it is terrible and then recover. The one thing we need to watch for next week is if CPI is truly terrible whether the feds (JPOW) will do any sort of emergency rate hike, unwinding of QT, balance sheet adjustments, etc. \n\nMy anticipation would be SPY see a red day Monday probably nothing impressive -1% to -1.5% to get us to that key 440-445 level. Overall the one thing I continue to learn every week is that the VIX is the gateway to spy. If you are not watching the VIX and learning its levels you are handicapping yourself. \n\n10% challenge weekly update-\n\nOverall I was able to have a pretty great week this week thankfully. \n\nI made 25 trade. 17 of which were green for a total 68% win rate on the week and averaged +6%/ trade.\n\nInterestingly enough I was 0 for 4 on apple trades which is not normal for me. \n\nMy weekly profit goal is $2500/ week and I was able to return a total of $7004 this week. \n\nSome lessons this week is that I need to manage my risk, I let quite a few losers run for way to long and that hurt not only my account but my % gains for the week. \n\nThe one thing that I want to do this next week is continue to limit my capital/ trade allocation. I saw myself this week start to increase my capital and in doing so I did not decrease the risk with further out expirations. This week I will work on risky trades (0-2dte) using smaller capital and when I feel confident in a trade utilizing 3-5 dte for the increased capital. I also need to make sure I remember to stay humble after a big week so that I do not take a chance of ruining those gains and seeing a revert to mean of my account. \n\nOverall great week for me and the server despite some fuckery in the markets which I do not forsee stopping at any time soon unfortunately.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'AMD vs NVDA vs MRVLOkay so I’m being completely transparent I own a lot of NVDA effectively it is artificial intelligence AMD I dumped for NVDA I do want to establish a position into another semi I was curious AMD is a beast but Marvell is a top pick at JPM and Goldman was curious or I can just add to my NVDA position MU doesn’t move much nor does Intel any feedback would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'AMD vs NVDA vs MRVLOkay so I’m being completely transparent I own a lot of NVDA effectively it is artificial intelligence AMD I dumped for NVDA I do want to establish a position into another semi I was curious AMD is a beast but Marvell is a top pick at JPM and Goldman was curious or I can just add to my NVDA position MU doesn’t move much nor does Intel any feedback would be greatly appreciated thanks in advance', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Buying SPY puts and calls this week', 'label': -1}, {'text': "Will AMD hold $100? My analysisAMD is at a really interesting spot, especially when you look at its [price history](https://imgur.com/a/14exHYw) all the way back to $10 and below. \n\nAs you can see, we got several clean bounces off of $10, $25, $50, $75 and perhaps now $100. These even steps dominate the weekly chart, looks extremely orderly to me compared to most stocks I've looked at. Right now it's balanced above the [downtrend that started at ATH](https://imgur.com/a/1UGyUPo), so a decision will be made very soon if it's gonna lose $100 or hold it and go higher. My theory is that the semiconductors were murdered a tad too much this week, and big money will take a second look at it over the weekend and scoop it. Especially since AMD is back down to this year's lows, and has already bounced cleanly off $100 on 1/28, 3/8 and 3/15. \n\nNot saying for sure it'll bounce, but it would be breaking it's trend of clean bounces going back 6+ years. Only exception was the 2020 crash at $50 which it clearly wanted to snap back from asap. Other than that it's only lost one of its key levels by no more than 3.1%. So this is an easy dip buy for me with a really good risk/reward ratio. Stop loss just below $96.9, so call it $96.5. Reward could be very good for a long-term hold or bounce to its 200sma around $118.

I have seen some analysts saying that inflation could spike to 10%.  Oil rose 35% in March reaching a high over $130 per barrel.  I am expecting inflation to be at least 8.5% which is going to shock the markets.  \n\nAnother factor, is that we have never experienced a market crash with as many high frequency trading algorithms that we have now.  The covid crash was not a complete recession, but we saw the insane movements intraday on all the indices.  I am fearing that there could be some massive panic selloff which is accelerated by high frequency algorithms in the near term.  The chances of this happening on Tuesday are low but are increasing as each day passes.  \n\nThe amount of people who are bullish on the market is also decreasing every single day, even people on WSB are starting to fear a recession and feel it will be a more likely outcome.\n\nI hate to be that person, but, over the last year with unemployment decreasing, spending increasing, and now inflation accelerating... this is exactly like the roaring 20s before the great recession.  No need to speculate that far ahead this is only a one week prediction.  Also I doubt the Federal Reserve would let the stock market crash over 80% without interfering.  At most there will be a 50% bear market similar to 2008.\n\nThe stock market will still be sloping down this week except the inflation data will cause some panic sell, then it should recover in the following days.\n\n \\* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more \n\n**TLDR**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j38bqv92ajs81.png?width=1281&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39172bb2a032402fe4c78d52443440fff4a1a227\n\nI will respond to every comment!', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'What are your guys thoughts on AMD?Just got some AMD yesterday for $101.75 and wanted to see what you all think about it good bet?\n\nAlso got more Disney?

After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my -2% red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20, 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days. \n\nThe bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesn’t have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema (above for bearish and below for bullish). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hpw0uyrqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e988c2486c9a35886e64c0572dda7db4c7f52f\n\nWe actually established yet another downward channel today that I don’t suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nzmwaslsqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=460f3ed4daf222a62703d594bc51c6a74e98085e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/li7lzt7tqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4347b8f4c091377d1ce4fba1560a3adac832fe92\n\nWe are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse. \n\nBut on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I don’t really forsee (unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10% that we do it) but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gk5l6gstqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1186f1a49dfdb4c8482bfe6b8db71a3e6c0a15d\n\nThe daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14m0bnhuqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb628bb79afa7a42f5d89e96ee5161666ca6c136\n\nThe daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20, 50 and 100 ema on the daily (445.21, 446.55 and 446.63) but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised (again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected) for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside. \n\nChannel support is 437 and resistance is 451 (unlimited upside) BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I don’t suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7xoaqpvqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7116303960c6b14d65486a7a6055fe9d2f6ebe3b\n\nWeekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within. However, we too opened and closed a full candle completely below the weekly 20 and 8ema (443.96, 445.9). The next support for the weekly puts us near 435.3 (weekly 50). \n\nAnother thing of note for tomorrow is the MASSIVE put OI out there for Wednesday and Thursday (monthly option expiration). \n\nWednesday OI shows literally nothing for calls. 16k at 437p. \n\nThursday monthly has 15k 445c, 55k 450c. Otherwise 121k 440p, 66k 435p, 113k 430p.\n\nThat is a massive amount of OI to the downside that’s expected this week alone. With this I would be very surprised not to see downside the rest of the week. Perhaps, we could see a relief rally tomorrow if CPI is good but I think Wednesday and Thursday is red with a goal of 430. The 430p monthly OI lines up with the TA I presented earlier too. \n\nWith the last CPI being 7.5%, expected at 7.9% but the consensus at 8.4% its not quite sue what we will see tomorrow. But with this being the first CPI with war, gas prices, more covid, etc. I have a feeling we will see somewhere closer to about 8.5 to 9%. I will be anxiously awaiting these numbers tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvve2nvwqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6cb5a86ef7f0a6606d8305928378625e0d55be0\n\nApple had a heck of a red day today too (mostly related to the MASSIVE spike in the 10 year to 2.774 today). I mentioned too on Friday that we should see a test of the daily 100 ema since we had broken the daily 20 ema. I did not, however, expect it to happen today. However, I was able to capitalize on some puts this morning. \n\nApple now is in an interesting place. Its clearly in the yellow downward channel and broken way out of its grey bull channel, with the 10 year rising which will obviously wreck tech. I think It is possible we could see a test of the Daily 200ema again near 158. However, my caveat for this is we must get bad CPI. A good CPI and a drop in the 10 year will send Apple soaring again. Apple is a risky play here. \n\nChannel support tomorrow is 157 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 166.6 which puts us back above the daily 100 ema and daily 50ema. A close tomorrow for apple back above the daily 50ema of 168.6 would be a bullish signal. However, if Apple loses 165.54 (daily 100ema) we can expect further downside this week. \n\nI currently am not in any apple positions as my target for my puts was 165 and I closed them at 166 this morning. Before the small intraday recovery. I may re-enter some longer 30dte puts depending on CPI and tomorrows finish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rvihq1qxqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=815d5abea3eb8fcfa988a512045e85dccccf6818\n\nThe blood for AMD just continues, but even worse off today was NVDA taking a massive -5.2 hit which I believe it was down around -6% at one point intraday. I actually entered some May 20th 85P on AMD this morning at open. With AMD now breaking what used to be VERY strong support at 100. This 100 support dates back to July 29th 2021 and saw around 7 support bounces before it finally broke down. With the 100 support broke I will be looking for a support bounce next near 72-74. This is the next major support which from July 2020 until may 2021 it saw 6 support bounces here before it made its way to 100 support. The next logical place for it to go is the 75 area which is why I locked in an 85p and did 39dte to give me some room to be right. \n\nI am also watching the 50ema now breaking below the 200 ema (tomorrow most likely) to form an official death cross. This should give it some continued downside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h42lt6cyqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=656bccd6c7693ffbff25068cf8b80b2484feb77c\n\nFord attempted to have a very bullish day opening around 2.5%, however, after a massive daily 8ema rejection I entered a May 20th 15p on Ford. I forsee after the daily 8ema rejection that Ford will continue its downward spiral that its currently in. Next major support I see for Ford is around 12.8 and after that is 11.2.\n\nFord also has the daily MACD sell signal and a lighter RSI at 38 which could show its nearing the bottom but Ford is very much so a give and take stock that I don’t suspect the RSI to be an issue. \n\nAgain took a 39dte put to give myself time to be correct but feel comfortable in this position. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26yjjyxyqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e647a1487ff5cbb7889db0f47334e17a6429f2b\n\nQQQ saw yet another massive gap down at open today to stay impressively within its current red downward channel. When I wrote the Friday TA I mentioned I was not sure it would stay within that channel but it did some how. \n\nChannel support is 322 (unlimited downside) and resistance is 342 for tomorrow. \n\nI also am seeing the daily 8ema now breaking below the 20, 50, 100 and 200 ema which is a bearish movement. Almost with the 20ema now back below the 50ema. I called out on SPY that 420-430 was support I suspected. I based that off the January 24th to January 28th price action. QQQ is currently already at that support here at 340 that I called out. That tells me TECH is most likely going to see further lows down near the March 15h lows if now lower. I for see 39 to 330 as next supports for QQQ. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qghek3jzqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50292337467bbf1fd1b3d55a377e4955d987401b\n\nThe VIX had yet again another MASSIVE day today. From low to high covering 11% from its low of 22.09 pre market to its high of 23.42 during power hour. Overall 23.9 was a major level for VIX to get over but once it did it really stepped out. 24.8 is the most recent high for the VIX seen on April 6th before that March 25th is the last time we saw these kinds of levels, but mind you that was on the downside not the upside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dkbfa40rzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718eb38d4ea8f47c4467f046cff1e33dd4fed944\n\nWhen you zoom out on the daily for VIX you can tell we are beginning to wind back up and very well could see the high 20s to 30s depending on what happens with CPI. \n\nOverall I am carrying the AMD May 20th 85P and Ford May 20th 15P over night along with a SPY June 17th 375P YOLO. I think we could very well see some more downside in this market and I while I think playing and guessing on CPI is like flipping a coin bet we see some downside the rest of the week. Even if CPI is expected and we get a flat to small bull rally tomorrow it would not surprise me to see downside Wednesday and Thursday. The market with the 10 year rising, 30 year fixed mortgages rising again, the inverted treasury yields, inflation, covid, war, gas, etc. etc. etc. recession, etc. etc. etc. talks ramping up is starting to panic again and I think despite people saying April is usually bullish I think we are going to start seeing some more downside over the next month or two. \n\nWhile some don’t think it’s a great correlation you know what that i cant post the name of... took a MASSIVE hit yesterday and today. B broke its major support and is now below 40k and E broke a major support now below 3k again. With those breaking major supports after their recent bull run recoveries I have a feeling that’s the pre-ample to the downside to come. I will be very very interested to not only see CPI but see markets reaction to it tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a fairly good day. I had a great morning I managed to play an apple put for 19%, a spy put for 20% and a call for 20%. I had to carry a very heavy put bag that was down about 70% at open that spiked to -30% around the first big drop to 441.5. With us holding there and not sure if we would see a massive reversal like Friday I took the L at -30%. I also played a call and put for -25% then -10% during the sideways chop. Followed by during power hour a two separated 10% puts. Overall intraday trade wise I finished near my daily profit goal, however, factoring in my L put I carried over and realize the loss on I finished in the red. To be today was a win because I managed risk and loss. Had SPY reversed back to 445 or even not dropped to 441.5 I would have had a fairly large L to carry. Today was a win for me.', 'label': 1}, {'text': '4-11-22 SPY (AMD, QQQ, F, Apple, VIX) Daily TA  \n\nThe day before CPI… the bulls were fast asleep snoozing the day away while the bears frolicked. After waiting over a month I ALMOST got my -2% red day. If you remember my TA from Friday I was pretty certain today would play out pretty much exactly how it did today. The key on Friday for me was the resistance at the daily 8ema and wicking below the 20, 50 and 100emas. We finally got the close below them today. While im not a huge fan of overnight plays on SPY Friday was one of those days. \n\nThe bears came out in full action without any signs they were going to stop today. To color me impressed would be an understatement. Today is one of the first days in months that I can remember SPY not closing a single candle inverse of the trend on the 15min chart. What I mean today is despite only 4 candle bodies above the 15 min 8ema there was not a single candle closed above the 15min 8ema which is a VERY strong trend. It is a rare day in SPY world that the trend doesn’t have at least one to three candles inverse of the trend on the 8ema (above for bearish and below for bullish). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hpw0uyrqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e988c2486c9a35886e64c0572dda7db4c7f52f\n\nWe actually established yet another downward channel today that I don’t suspect to really matter much over night as most intraday channels will end up being negated due to time lapse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nzmwaslsqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=460f3ed4daf222a62703d594bc51c6a74e98085e\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/li7lzt7tqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4347b8f4c091377d1ce4fba1560a3adac832fe92\n\nWe are clearly within the triple red channel still and as I mentioned this morning we broke down through the top tiers support and now are trading within the middle tier. We also established a purple downward resistance line that was started Friday morning. I am not sure if that will hold over night either though due to time lapse. \n\nBut on the red triple channel the middle tier support puts us near 436 and resistance is near 441 at open tomorrow. I don’t really forsee (unless CPI truly is like 9.5 or 10% that we do it) but if we break through the middle tier support next support is near 430 to 431.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gk5l6gstqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1186f1a49dfdb4c8482bfe6b8db71a3e6c0a15d\n\nThe daily chart is something of beauty to me. As you can see we clearly broke the RED upward bull channel and there is no change to salvage that nor readjust it to even convince me we are still in that. Surprisingly we actually broke support of the bearish grey channel too. However I went ahead and adjusted that to look as so now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14m0bnhuqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb628bb79afa7a42f5d89e96ee5161666ca6c136\n\nThe daily chart tells nothing but a very bearish omen for SPY right now. Today we not only opened below the 20, 50 and 100 ema on the daily (445.21, 446.55 and 446.63) but we also wicked below the daily 200 ema AND closed below it. I would be very surprised (again unless CPI is some miracle WAY better than expected) for us to not retest the 420 to 430 support area at this rate. The MACD is still confirmed bearish and RSI at 45 has plenty of room for downside. \n\nChannel support is 437 and resistance is 451 (unlimited upside) BUT being that we actually broke this channel today I am not convinced that 437 is very accurate. Price action wise I look at 430 as the next major support for SPY. Of course I don’t suspect outside of a terrible CPI that we will see that tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7xoaqpvqzs81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7116303960c6b14d65486a7a6055fe9d2f6ebe3b\n\nWeekly Spy chart is very busy as we continue to search for the channel we are within.

JPMorgan will be the first of the top six banks to report earnings, with Wall Street focusing on how the volatility caused by the Ukraine war affected investment banking and trading operations.\n\nTreasury 10-year yields fell after reaching their highest level since December 2018.\n\nOil has surpassed $100 per barrel.\n\nThe rise in crude oil prices, along with other commodities, has fueled inflation fears, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively.

I believe the correction is over and the market has now gotten more used to a more hawkish fed.\n\nThe fed has gotten more Hawkish due to inflation, which I believe will begin stabilizing and even subsiding over the next several quarters.   \nPrimarily because  :  \n1- Consumer demand and spending has been declining for two months and will continue to do so IMO, due to a moderation of govt spending bills, stimulus money running out and savings declining.\n\n2- Because inflation of energy prices due to the Russian-Ukaranian war have mostly already been baked in since March.\n\nSlowing inflation can give leeway to the fed to turn less hawkish, which can fuel a major bull market rally.  \n\\-- AMD\'s Fundamental Picture --  \nAMD\'s price has gone down by nearly half since its major peak last year at around \\~$160  \nNothing fundamental about AMD\'s business has changed . The company even raised its growth expectations for 2022 in its last earnings call. AMD is expected to grow its revenue by no less than 60% by the end of the year and more than double its profit.  \nDemand for semiconductors continues to be very strong and will remain so for the remainder of the year.  \nAMD successfully completed its acquisition of XLNX late last year, which strengthens AMD\'s competitive position in the server business, and area where the company has been kicking ass and taking record breaking market share from Intel.  In fact more than a quarter of all x86 CPUs sold today are AMD, the [highest market share](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-amd-4q-2021-2022-market-share-desktop-notebook-server-x86) in the history of the company.\n\nThe company is also expected to release the first ever 5nm x86 "Zen 4" CPUs [this year](https://www.techspot.com/news/92835-amd-ces-2022-roadmap-zen-4-am5-ryzen.html), which would extend its manufacturing process lead vs Intel and allow it capture even more market share and grow profitability and margins.\n\n\\-- AMD\'s Technical Picture --\n\n1- I believe AMD has bottomed here at the \\~$90 level.  \nWhy?  \n\\- We tagged the 100-day moving average for the first time since April 2018. The last time this happened AMD went up from $10 to $30 in six months.  \n\\- We hit a double bottom on the daily RSI after a major peak. The last time this happened was Dec 2018 and AMD went up by 60% the following 6 weeks.  \n\\- AMD has been on a very strong bullish trendline since 2016. The stock just entered the most attractive green buy zone on my hand drawn pitchfork channel. This has only happened 3 times in the last 5 years. Every time it happened in those 3 instances AMD went up by 38%, 240% &amp; 66% respectively.   \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/md7sngogsnt81.png?width=1496&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1ad41472f6cf7a1dc7d0c907061ac0e8b82bb58\n\nThis DD encompasses my opinions and educated guesses about the macroeconomic and monetary environments for this year which may or may not be accurate.  \nI am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Then I noticed, that both have margins of error, so finding the average of the 30Y + 10Y would be an even better indicator.  Also as the bond yields approach 0 they will decrease slower.

Analysts predict that number will be closer to 2.7 million. Either figure would mark a significant downturn from the 3.98 million added during the same period in 2021.\n\nInvestors’ hyper focus on new paying customers led Netflix shares to plummet 20% after the company’s last earnings report in January. In addition to weaker-than-forecasted fourth-quarter subscriber gains, company executives quietly admitted that competition from other streaming platforms was having a negative impact on its growth.\n\nNetflix has increased its content spend, particularly on originals, amid intense competition in the streaming space. To pay for it, it’s hiked prices of its service.

Most of the upward bull swing was made within the first 45 minutes of the day though with some impressively large green candles. \n\nAs you can see we closed ABOVE and well ABOVE the red bear channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcsh3xt43ku81.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b345fa48e77df7e86869db0613be60f979aa6c\n\nSo yep you guessed it… SPY OFFICIALLY broke the bear channel started back on March 29th. BUT we have NOT made a new higher high until SPY  breaks that large black dotted like at 450. Once SPY breaks 450 I will officially call this a bull run. Until then we could be forming a wider bear channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iw2qdxb53ku81.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=471f6939e5131df16c424c56bd97408bf9d65fb1\n\nWhich looks something like this! \n\nThis much wider bear channel gives us a resistance as I mentioned at 450 and a new support at 432. Now the one issue here is that Netflix just got absolutely obliterated on its earnings again (down 26% as im writing this). With Netflix posting a massive hit like that I worry that the markets are going to over react and take a hit here to price in terrible earnings. We have Tesla earnings after hours tomorrow and that will be the true test of what is going to happen with the markets this earnings season in my opinion. However, it would be naive not to expect a retrace tomorrow with this Netflix hit as we see right now -0.44% currently. Definitely will be something to watch intraday tomorrow. 442.7 provided heavy support today so that is definitely a level we need to keep an eye on tomorrow. As long as spy holds that (bounced off it after hours) I believe we will see green tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pf0coi063ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a97057111bcce4b3e507b4e6554e79d929a1510d\n\nSPY daily chart we are still in the bear channel as I mentioned until we see 450 tomorrow (if it comes). Right now the main take aways for the day was that the bulls managed to close Spy ABOVE the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema today after opening below all the EMAs. That is a VERY bullish finish today and will in my opinion set the tone for the rest of the week and next. The only bearish take away I have from today is that bulls were not able to close above the daily 100ema of 446.04. However, this close here gives us a easy spot to close above the daily 100ema tomorrow. The daily 8ema of 442.7 (at the time) provided support almost all day today and that is something I will look for to continue tomorrow with the 8ema closing at 442.91. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f6eeqj63ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8701d9b4131fb199290bfdf86b8d30be77cf6fd\n\nApple had a bullish day today also but actually failed to break its bear channel on the 15min chart. This channel has a resistance of 168 tomorrow and support of 160.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xsd4pu673ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d525b6936b700ef73774b51c580f140de41bea97\n\nDespite Apples green day it actually looks more bearish than SPY today. Apple failed to break its daily 8/ 50ema at 168.27 today. That is actually fairly bearish, however, bulls could argue Apple closed above the 100ema after trading below it for 3 days and now has an opportunity tomorrow to close above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100ema. The goal for bulls tomorrow will be to close above 170. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/npvf60r73ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c594662927394de8e92430af721c2d7aef84ad3\n\nQQQ of apple and SPY is the one I recommend going long on here, knowing it COULD see a small drop if earnings really are bad these next two weeks. I had my girl load up on QQQ today as I find it to be a great buying spot for it. QQQ is roughly 19% of its highs still and to me offers the most upside potential. \n\nQQQ as you can see broke their bear channel today. QQQ also was able to close ABOVE its daily 8ema of 345.35 today which is the first time if almost two weeks. The daily 20 (348.85), 50 (351.93), 200 (357.18) and 100 (358.06) are all now well within the grasps of QQQ if you can close above it. You can also see QQQ managed to hold a crucial support of 338. I mentioned the possible head and shoulders formed that would shoot QQQ back to 375-380 in the next few weeks. If bears are in control tomorrow they will attempt to close back below the daily 8ema again and also break it back near that 338 support line. \n\nOverall we are entering earnings season and now is a risky time to be holding ANYTHING over night. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3c8tjh983ku81.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b586e1e9ecc4c2b151dabed52e3560134610e10\n\nRealistically besides Tesla tomorrow and SNAP on Thursday there isn’t any truly market moving (not that SNAP is) earnings to write home about. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was quite the day for me as I was able to make about 2.5x my daily profit goal today. I have officially secure my weekly profit goal already which is crucial since I wont get to trade Friday. I will look to continue to play conservative the rest of the week. The change to 3dte and a small position size so far has been great and successful.

The bearish volume just kept flowing in and never stopped. With an impressive total range today of $14.66 which hit 153% of the average true range of $9.56.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nf8vfss13kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=790c5abb2c522b791f8596c4f0c884a5113808d1\n\nWe are in such an impressive bear channel right now and such a violent bear channel that if it breaks 410 Monday we very well could see below 400 by Wednesday before FOMC. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qw8bgle23kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1024f388939b9eacc977f556151dffe291f1a07\n\nOn the daily we are at an impressive point to say the least. We failed to reach the low of February 24th by about $0.60. the low of 410.64 is the most recent low. With us hitting 411.21 intraday one COULD call 411 a double bottom potential. \n\nI am still working on a theory that we are in a sideways (blue) channel from 415 to 458 with a few outliers here and there. So if SPY is able to within one or two more candles return to and hold above 415 it think my theory holds true. \n\nHowever I am also working that theory of the red bear channel which gives us a low of 400 by EOW (May 6th) or if we are within the orange bear channel we could see 394 within the next two weeks if we continue a steady decline. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9p9zk1x23kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=259aed3e45e607bebb028bfd3875283ff6d8fc35\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/10vsaod33kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49079a5190515d39d1ad9aff7ac3df3b5eef3857\n\nI shared this weekly chart last week which show how we very well could be headed for a true bear market and could see the weekly chart touch the 200 ema at 360 for the first time since the Covid crash, and before that was the 2018 crash. 405.88 is currently the weekly 100ema and will be interesting to see if SPY can hold above that next week or not. If spy was to lose that next week I think we all but would guaranteed a visit to the 200 ema of the next few months. \n\nOn the current trajectory we could see the 200ema at 360 by middle of July. \n\nAs you can see we have a fuck ton of bearish momentum ahead and formed this week. It will be VERY important for bulls to not let this drop below 405 this week and definitely not let it stay below 405 this week. \n\nMy personal take is that we are not going to break 400 YET. I think we are going to see 400-405 Monday or Tuesday (about a 60-70% chance) and then Wednesday when FOMC happens JPOW is going to use his fancy works and nimble tools to rally the market like last time. As long as JPOW doesn’t throw a 100bps hike out there (whether we need it or not) the market should rally. The recent narrative is that inflation has peaked so realistically we should hear JPOW be singing that tune this week. \n\nHowever, IF like January JPOW gets up there and acts scared or says some off the wall stuff we are going to see 380-390 EOW without a doubt. There is a pretty good case to argue Monday we will see some sort of relief rally. A -4% drop on realistically a nothing burger is going to have some sort of relief. I would suspect us to revisit 415-420 on Monday. That doesn’t mean Tuesday may not drill us to 400-410 though. Current downward trend/ extreme bear channel resistance line for Monday is at 420. If bulls can rally the troops and break that we may see a bigger relief rally headed into Wednesday FOMC. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oj1tmjx33kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f767098018fb33df40b2cda293666dd4e28b36\n\nI had mentioned earlier this month that we had some consolidation periods that were followed by rallys. We do appear to be making another one of those periods right now if you look at the blue circles followed by the blue arrows. Each of those hit 450-460 range. If this one drops slightly lower around 400 it would be safe to say we could rally to 440-450 range. \n\nThe daily RSI is also starting to become very oversold finally hitting 35. This RSI is the same exact RSI that SPY rallied from in February and March. I will be very curious to see what FOMC and next week brings. I am going long here though at these levels well slowly entering long which I will touch on in my positions and the end of this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/asxdbrf43kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a70689dba051dc9f2bacac5b46173b324a76ada2\n\nApple had quite the red day today, of course not the same 5% green it had the day before, but after that earnings beat followed by not so great guidance it saw a -3.66% red day. \n\nApple finished back under its daily 200ema. I had mentioned that breaking back under the 200ema is not a good sign for apple. Apple has not had two candles in a row below the 200 ema since the Covid crash. Another candle Monday below the 8ema would be the first time in 2 years. \n\nApple also had a great upper channel resistance rejection this morning at 166.\n\nIf apple continues this trajectory downward we could see 145 range by middle to end of May. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0w1f25153kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a52e5bb95077c6d1e96c7af1afb8eb14c874e837\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfpohti53kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a11653e6d214f8d0f212855bab3c1643a4667aa\n\nOn the weekly chart Apple has not broke its 50ema currently at 154.57 since covid crash. Currently Apple bounced off that 50ema this week and on the current trajectory is about to see it broken this week if it doesn’t see some serious upside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9t8fx163kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96fa025c14b2846bb031ec97f0cc81bd1521f296\n\nQQQ is on an impressive downward trajectory and is the first of Apple, SPY and QQQ to break its low from February. It will be interesting to see if QQQ will bounce this week or not. Its pretty safe to assume that until QQQ bounces SPY most likely will not bounce either. \n\nI had mentioned that 310-315 was a key level to watch for QQQ and we hit there today. \n\nI will be watching to see if QQQ will break upwards towards 318, 322 and 328 resistance or if its gonna continue this trajectory and see 300 by the end of week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4navxm63kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b487587b68af408ed9c6a8ab1f31bb61ba0c354\n\nQQQ weekly charts actually on an impressively aggressive downward trend right now. It also unlike the February and March it closes a almost full candle below the weekly 100ema of 324.81. As you can imagine the last time that happened was the covid crash. \n\nThere currently is a fairly good argument we COULD see the weekly 200ema at 276 before the end of the month of May. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7g7s0773kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c75164fc17b18776781577187d92b8e5119b23ff\n\nThe VIX is going to be something to watch over the next week and where it opens Monday. If you remember I said a week or 2 ago that until we get something to spook the markets and the VIX can get back near 35-40 SPY had no chance of seeing 400. Well I stand by the fact that we really have had nothing to spook the market, it just conveniently just all of a sudden remembered that inflations is bad and covid/ supply chains are bad. Earnings this week arguably was the catalyst the market needed to spike the vix and see these levels again. \n\nLooking at the VIX daily chart our happy spot is 28 to 33.5. I will be watching for those key levels next week as we head into FOMC. With the added “fear” of FOMC on Wednesday we may see the VIX hit that key 40 level. \n\nI do believe if the VIX keeps rising we very well could see 400 Monday or Tuesday. However, I think a lot of that fear of the market and fear of the inflation unknowns with FOMC will dissipate on Wednesday and by Friday we would see the VIX unwind back down to or below 30. \n\nLooking back at February the VIX range at heights was 28.5 to 32.5 with a two big spikes to 39 and 36. In March the heights had us at 28 to 34.3 with a few spikes up to 36 and 37. So its safe to say while we may see a quick spike to or above 35 it would be pretty safe to assume that it would be short lived and be the next day or at least two days later their would be a dip in the vix and relief rally in spy. \n\nLooking at this more I do for see how we could hold around this level Monday and Tuesday. See a massive spike Wednesday only to see FOMC bring the vix down and start the next short term bull run. Unless the FOMC can reveal something terrible that is going to keep the VIX held and based here above 32 and even close to 40 there really isn’t in my opinion a big enough catalyst to see sub 400. \n\nDoing a quick look back since the Covid Crash anytime the VIX has spike intraday over 35 and especially anytime it has hit 37-40 it has within a week feel back down and fallen hard. This week if I happen to catch a day where VIX spikes to 37 to 40 I will hit up some 14dte OTM calls banking on that massive relief rally. \n\n10% challenge weekly wrap up-\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 20%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 3 dte 40%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 15%\n\n4/29/2022 put 0dte 40%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 3 dte 1%\n\n4/29/2022 Call 0dte -20%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 3dte 27%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 40%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte -50%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 5%\n\n4/29/2022 put 3dte 15%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 20%\n\n4/29/2022 Put (apple) 7dte 9%\n\n4/29/2022 Put 0dte 12%\n\nI made 54 total trades this week (25 calls and 29 puts)\n\nWin rate- 74% \n\nPut win rate-72.4% \n\nCall win rate- 72% win rate \n\nMy biggest loss came from a bad bounce on a 0dte put on Monday (still haunts me because it bounce hard and then would have been green). MY biggest win came from a call. \n\nWeekly profit goal- $2500\n\nActual week profit- $4,247 \n\nThis was a very tough week for me where I suffered some very large losses especially on Monday that I had to overcome throughout the week. Going into today I barely was green for the week but I was able to have a killer day intraday today. \n\n8 of my 54 trades were 3 dte or higher for a win rate of 62.5% \n\n46 of my 54 trades were 0-2 dte for a win rate of 76%\n\nMy weekly goal was to have a win rate of 80% which I fell short of. I am pretty content with the overall 74% win rate and for the last two months that has been my average now. I would like to see 80% this week. However, one thing I want to take into account is trades where I exited at less then 10% of a loss. While yes that is a loss and not a win that is me manually exiting a trade because I recognize I entered a bad time, caught a bad bounce, momentum faded, etc. \n\nThere were 6 total losses for less than 10% loss. \n\nSo 40 wins plus 6 calculated/ mitigated losses= 46 or a win rate of 85.2% \n\nThat is something I would like to keep track of over the weeks to. I preach in my server that mitigating losses so that they are manageable to recover from is half the battle. Had Monday and Tuesday I better mitigated losses I would not have had had as big of a hole to get out of end of week. When the momentum dies we need to exit. \n\nWe can ALWAYS re-enter a trade and that’s what I have done this week a lot when momentum. Get in get 10-20%. Exit. Wait for the second push and re-enter. Time and time again till the momentum completely shifts. \n\nHyper wheel update\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1z1f47083kw81.png?width=824&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=393cbb9758fe8503e976976442482dca404e03e1\n\nI sat cash most of today with the hyperwheel knowing we would probably see a -3% day of course I did not expect a -4% day but at the 4165 level I went ahead and resold some of my cash secured puts. So I am back on the hyperwheel right now. As I mentioned I think we are at a near bottom and I have pretty strong faith we will see at or above 415 by EOW again when my puts expire. \n\nLastnight I also mentioned I was going to enter some 60dte calls (30 delta) once we hit a bottom as an upside hedge. I did that today. I started at 420 and I plan every $5 we drop to dollar cost average by one contract. I will probably also do that on the way up until we high 425 maybe 430 and then I will let them ride till 440 most likely. At that time I will need to calculate upside vs downside potential to find a good time to take profits. I was very tempted to DCA at 411 today but if we truly hit 410 next week that opportunity will still be there. I am not that worried yet as my current breakeven is 418. Had I averaged down my break even would be closer to 416.3 though. This is a hedge not a full position so I didn’t and opted for the shorter term 432c way OTM calls. \n\nI also at 410 today decided to get some 7dte lotto calls for EOW. I have pretty strong faith in a bounce EOW after FOMC and maybe even before FOMC. Perhaps even Monday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgpkpzk83kw81.png?width=661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=030f50f2d3a9ba06abffd989c04e568e7249d14c', 'label': 1}, {'text': "Musk has already started selling $4 billion in TSLA stock to buy Twitter.

We have officially broken outta the bear channel from April 21st to present. However, we have not broken the 15min bear resistance line from March 29th that puts us near 442. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbazyth4sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f99ea0758f76382a45c3751af5cd49d52f8a9d8\n\nOne thing bulls need to be careful of is that we now see a TRIPLE top formed on the 15minute chart at 430 from March 26th, March 28th and today. We rejected pretty hard there and have fallen pretty hard from that high after hours now. There is definitely question whether we continue rally tomorrow or retrace. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/is3wg815sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b11d9e61cd40a3f27d83fc2a069cd1def991696\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cu2j2k5sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a75000d47918f6b03c5d4cc4b2c971d03bb260b\n\nCurrent daily chart you can see we have NOT broken the bear channel there YET. We actually perfectly rejected the top resistance line much like April 21st. This resistance line also happens to be the Daily 20ema too. \n\nBulls are going to need to see a clean green day tomorrow and try to close around 437 to confirm a breakout and step far away from this bear channel. \n\nHowever, if the bears are able to keep up this after hours rally (bear rally) then we may see a nice red open and test support down close to 423 and even 420 tomorrow. As long as bears can open this red and keep it under 428 tomorrow they maintain the integrity of the bar channel but will need a pretty red day to get low enough that Friday doesn’t break trend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vz8vkc6sjx81.png?width=841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f02b570fb5942b1816522fd36647de02f8bd1151\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/930w7sr6sjx81.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de3ea1b9f94eb1f5570762e6a405c57c0c780366\n\nOne thing that may help the bears though is the fact the VIX went from a high of 29.42 today all the way down to 24.94 at its lows before it bounced off that 25 level. \n\nThis is the first time the VIX has been touched below 25 since April 22nd. As I have been saying the current 3 week long vix trend has been between 26.5 to 36.5 with a mean of 29 to 32.6. Now that we have broken lower we could see a return to the previous mean levels of 25 to 18.7 before we had the massive sell off. However, after what could be argued as a massive over reaction to the FOMC announcement and press conference we very well COULD see a reversion to mean tomorrow on VIX and SPY. That’s the way I am playing the rest of the week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jk3a7a7sjx81.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a29c672c98c9fd1541cd200f2ffadf7468b59fd\n\nAs you can see Apple has broken one bear channel BUT has not fully broken the lower highs yet as you can see below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ce4l2fq7sjx81.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2c29a07101d5832fd44a1fa353229aecbc15de6\n\nMuch like SPY apple is RIGHT at is channel resistance line and will need to see a pretty significant move downward over night which it has done after hours to lock this bear channel in. If bears can keep this under 165.7 at open and maintain a red day tomorrow they should hold bear channel integrity and look for a retest of the daily 8ema closer to 161.6 and eventually the daily 200ema near 158.25.\n\nHowever, if bulls get the breakout we are gonna look to test that resistance peak from April 21st at 171.5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faqx6td8sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e8a6f677606aaaa2a67be578af078a9f6ea8fc4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2prpuvu8sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bcfb3249b03fe2aac2adafc70ea49452c3ade0b\n\nAs you can see QQQ too maintains a bear channel. With a rejection of its daily 20ema and the bear channel with a after hours retrace. If the bears can maintain a high of 328 (which is also a major support/ resistance line) tomorrow then they will look to push red and test lower supports of 323 and 317. \n\nBulls will look to break through the daily 20ema of 332 and eventually test the daily 50ema of 342.\n\nSo whats the theme here? We had a hell of a bull rally today but we are not outta the bear woods yet. And even IF we see a short term bull run we are still on all tickers a overall bear channel. I would equate this to a bear market rally. I don’t know how big it will be or when it will stop but we soon will find out. There is a case to be made that we are going to break down again tomorrow and will end up back at the lows of the week before Fridays close. However, bulls have an opportunity to break some highs and close a green week after 4 red weeks in a row. As long as SPY closes above 412 it will break its 4 red week trend right now. However, it does not mean it breaks the bear trend. I would again call this a bear market rally. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nMan big oof here. Today is one of those days where you watch your account go from massive loss to big profits. I took advantage of the FOMC run and scalped tons of profits today. I watched my account around 11am this morning go from negative two times weekly profit goal to now close of market being up one times weekly profit goal. \n\nSometimes when we are facing red we have to keep fighting but we have to be smart about how we fight. This morning and really all day 0dte was not paying well and was just burning me so I made a switch to 2dte and they paid like crazy. Now that I am in profits for the week I will look to take some risk off tomorrow and Friday and try to end with 2x weekly profits if I can. \n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gt5h9syasjx81.png?width=457&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5e78923d6d195e3f035898eac7ef6a7ae8dfe3f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also cleared out my account positions and will talk about that here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4tkiwrkbsjx81.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3ed2c0e413a536d443717ef0988aadbb99d2d1b\n\nSo overall this is what I carried over night last night.\n\n\\-I close the MES cashed secured puts for 5% before the JPOW rally (regrets but I took a calculated risk as rallying $10 we coulda easily fallen $10 and with the losses I was at I could NOT risk my account with that drop). I will look to see how rest of the week plays out and see if I resell my puts or hold till after CPI on Wednesday\n\n\\- EOD I closed the 441C for 52% profits\n\n\\-EOD closed the 432C for 60% profits\n\n\\-before JPOW I closed the 421c  for -52% and the 423C for -70%. Of course I had no way of knowing we were going to see 430 and I wanted to salvage what I could. I fully anticipated the best bull case of 425. Which barely woulda breaken those even but with theta eating 0dte up like crazy I had to exit when I could. It was quite a large loss and that’s what I found back from all day. \n\nThat’s the hard part we have to make calculated risks. I should have just closed last night at -32% and -55% but I expected a morning rally but that didn’t happen so I took a bigger loss. However, had the morning dump been a morning rally I woulda got paid huge on my risk. In the end we have to stop letting losers run so long. I still struggle on this and especially in this wacky market I struggle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4gc4gp7csjx81.png?width=961&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e409866141d12a92b4cc66d5686a6f8863aa4279\n\nCurrently this is what im holding… So my goal for those 59dte CALLS were to hold till 430 maybe 440. But I expected a bit of a slower run up. I think 430 could be our top and at 50% I felt I needed to take profits now. \n\nSo I am now repositioning for the next drop. End of day today I purchased a overnight put 2dte 428P and I also picked up some 382p (15 delta) 57dte puts. My goal with these is to add one put for every $2.5 we go over 430. So I will next add at $432.5, $435, etc.   \n \n\nI have no doubt that we will revisit within the next 60dte 400 range. And when we do I will look to make similar profits like I did off the 60dte calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rjjcp6scsjx81.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fa540c390e5d1279d7fca9fc0cf0b69aba0f4d4\n\nTook a gamble on the hyperwheel and loss… as you can see the Buy and hold is far exceeding my hyperwheel return. However, I have no contracts currently open so I am risk off right now. As I mentioned I was not comfortable with not knowing if we would dump or rocket after JPOW. I had a quick thought to throw them back on at 415 but by time I could think about it the opportunity was gone.\n\nI will watch tomorrow and Friday to see how we end up and decide if I readd my CSP before next week or wait till after CPI on Wednesday.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'gains on spy puts', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Sorry guys it was me , I shorted 51 million spy contracts on demo', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Ghetto Trades on Tsla cost $4 for Max profit of $500', 'label': -1}, {'text': '$SPY is hella sus right now.[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'More AMZN puts 😀', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'SPY 10k YOLO $432 5/9 CALLS', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Gainzzzzz AMD', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'What are you complaining about my SPY 500 calls are green.', 'label': 1}, {'text': "If Robinhood is such a POS brokerage, you could make the meta-bet of your life.Why bet on Robinhood going to bankrupt?\n\nThe meta-bet would be puts on the entire system.

This might not be new information to some of you, and I know a few of you have noticed this shit already. This post is for the people who blindly trade SPY FDs based on the daily discussion in this subreddit and can barely read a chart. Hopefully, this information inspires you to learn how to read candlesticks.\n\nWho am I kidding, none of us can read candlesticks. None of us can even read. That\'s why I included lots of charts with colors and shit because most of you gave up reading after the first two sentences.\n\n**Things You Need to Understand Before You Read Further:**\n\n*Elliott Wave Theory -* This theory just basically says that people buy and sell in a predictable 5 wave pattern due to the concept of herd mentality among investors. Waves 1, 3, and 5 are long and predictable uptrends (new investors enter bullish positions because everyone else is bullish). Waves 2 and 4 are short and unpredictable countertrends (investors are now getting cold feet because the price has been moving up for a while and there is uncertainty as to whether the current price accurately represents the value of a share, so people sell). Wave 5 is always followed by a relatively large countertrend correction.\n\n*Trends and Countertrends -* A trend (in this context) usually just means a bull market. Price is moving upwards, followed by a small correction, followed by another period of bullish price movement. This is when you should be trading because **trends are predictable.** Countertrends are the bearish price corrections that occur after a bullish trend in order to confirm support levels. Countertrends can take many different forms and are therefore very unpredictable. **You should not trade during countertrends because, again, price movement is not predictable.** \n\nI was going to go on to explain some bearish patterns and other basic jargon but I know you\'re not gonna read it. If you aren\'t familiar with the triple top, head and shoulders, Fibonacci retracement, or support and resistance lines please stop reading and run a quick Google search on those terms.\n\n\\-----------\n\n**Okay.

Instead, I\'ll just show you my analysis and let you draw your own, very intelligent conclusions that I am sure are not based on fear or greed whatsoever. \n\n**Ladies and Gentlemen, I Present the "oh fuck" Zone** \n\nStock drops after an aggressive push upwards, forming a new resistance line at the peak. Following this, new support will form at a level that I have deemed the "oh fuck" zone, or a zone in which the price will breach critical support and plummet to a new low. You\'ll notice that there are recurring patterns and sequences that present themselves in every chart that I will show you after this brief breakdown of the "oh fuck" pattern.\n\nIt usually goes like this:\n\n1. Stock drops after an aggressive push upwards, forming a new resistance line at the peak.\n2. SPY fights back above that resistance line but is unable to produce a trend upwards. It then tumbles down below this resistance.\n3. After that, you\'ll see bearish price action as SPY gasps for air but is unable to successfully recover above resistance.\n4. The "oh fuck" zone is breached and SPY dumps. Hard.\n\nHere\'s the 2018 chart. It\'s easy to analyze because it\'s very cut and dry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The \\\\"Oh Fuck\\\\" Zone \\(2018\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qwmnkelj1sx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ba591bed177665f6e560e3ba1df29028bc3c972)\n\nHere\'s the crash of 2008.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The 2008 Crash, Charted](https://preview.redd.it/rt5qxkfw1sx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f81919bea43ad7aa8e6c4ec18fde0dfcc4debb78)\n\nAnd here\'s where we are now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current Chart, With \\\\"oh fuck\\\\" Zone](https://preview.redd.it/qrywz4rd2sx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6e0ef1e93641693d5092d3c2e702a9b38fdc54e)\n\nNow, you might be thinking "but how do you know this isn\'t a trendy move and we\'re not just gonna shoot up from here? Don\'t stocks only go up? It\'s easy to draw lines on a chart for price moves that have already happened", and honestly, you\'d be correct. I don\'t know for a fact that this is a guaranteed recession signal. For example, here\'s a chart showing where SPY recovered from a similar pattern in 2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[An example of SPY recovering from the \\\\"oh fuck\\\\" pattern, 2019](https://preview.redd.it/xtvewx2e4sx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec073c233e4611271f0a265ba4492dfe3fba270)\n\n**Now, how do we know when to expect these patterns?** \n\nI\'m glad you asked. This is where the Elliott Waves come into play. We can predict the severity of bearish price movement by determining where we are on the Elliott Wave pattern. If we are on waves 1 or 3, we can expect the countertrends of waves 2 or 4 to be relatively short and mild. If we are on wave 5, we can expect a shitshow as soon as the 5th wave trend ends. \n\nAnd guess where we are now. That\'s right. We are in the middle of a massive countertrend following the previous 5th wave trend. This happens every couple of years, but we are overdue for the big one. Here\'s a chart showing our current position on the Elliott Waves.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Our Current Position Along the Elliott Wave](https://preview.redd.it/a1wt5nxuktx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7abc8d8176cb58394459c250c0a6b811899428a1)\n\nIn all honesty, there\'s no telling where we go from here. But one thing is for certain, this is a massive countertrend. Keep in mind that the term "countertrend" doesn\'t mean that the price only goes down. It might go up and down over a period of time. Being in a countertrend really just means that we are in the middle of price movement that is not trendy, or goes against the previous trend. We can\'t accurately predict the price movement of a countertrend, which is why we are all getting fucked on moves that we thought we had all figured out. If you still don\'t understand, here\'s a couple charts showing you what a countertrend really looks like and the unpredictability that lies within.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2018 Countertrend](https://preview.redd.it/3av5v3a1mtx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f4a80b25b0a5958a49d43073086e9b1cf4cfc87)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2008 Countertrend](https://preview.redd.it/0rncil04mtx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c6fb5c91b43880c57aac13db87b7098cb37ff02)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current Countertrend](https://preview.redd.it/pbfg2uj8mtx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e85505ebcdb20f2788db056599a100f0af6c85)\n\nAs you can see, there is money to be made on both Call and Put options within these trends at certain points.

A lot. But it\'s almost obligatory that I include a hypothetical scenario regarding our current SPY price to the 2008 chart. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here\'s a side-by-side without drawings or markers.](https://preview.redd.it/ff3tkaointx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba835731f29dcd5c1aa4f60b25ecadda55cda6b8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[And Here\'s a Chart With a Super Shitty Price Correlation Map](https://preview.redd.it/whqsbyenntx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43c00a18b90f775a8d916740d5dcc2594e7a158f)\n\n"It\'s not identical! some of the price moves are way longer or shorter", yes I know. You are right about this as well. This map is mainly here to highlight the similarities in price action and how the market responded to those movements. And those reactions mimic each other very well. This kind of price action doesn\'t happen every day. But of course, formulate your own opions based on your own research. Don\'t let me stop you from buying those weekly calls.\n\nIf I were to guess, I\'d say we hit 450 again before we dump. We might dump before then, I can\'t guarantee anything. Fuck it, we might not even dump at all. But I know for certain that if SPY cannot break the resistance above 450 and produce a bullish trend, we will dump harder than you ever thought was possible. With JPOW\'s speech at the FOMC basically saying "fuck it we ball", there is no real solution being presented in order to fix this massive looming economic correction. In fact, this potential recession is key to recovering the health of the economy. It might be the only thing that can fix this shit. I mean, you gotta remember that recessions are necessary for a healthy economy and they are inevitable. Of course, better monetary policy could have been enacted to soften the blow, but it\'s a bit too late for that.\n\n**So...**\n\nHere\'s a Fib trend retracement of SPY currently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Current Chart - Fibonaci Retracement ](https://preview.redd.it/9i2fjvobqtx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d567c5913439ae194b3ed232895b68e3094dce31)\n\nThe grey line is very near our current "oh fuck" zone.

Close for an 80% gain which granted that’s some killer profits on an over night lotto… end of day it was up at 500% before power hour. Does it hurt? Yea I mean a little but it hurts less then -100% so I got that going for me haha. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5jr3bue2rx81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c86651baa7438492d0b57792f42b80e0311c24ad\n\nIf you didn’t know there is a WIKI page with the large moves for SPY well we made Top 10 today and missed top 5 by 0.07%. \n\nNot gonna like the fact that SPY was down 3.8% but 1115am was beyond impressive and had broken -4% intraday before noon. This is one of the fastest and most aggressive intraday drops ive watched. I thought there COULD be a chance we get the circuit breaker today but that wasn’t in the paybook I guess… for now. \n\nThe thing that actually sucked the most about today was I went into the day bearish But in my head 420 was the max I thought we would drop. We had nearly blown through that before we even had the first candle of the day and then once we broke 418 I really was speechless. \n\nI always tell myself man I want a massive 4-5% day cause I know imma make bank but real talk the whole time you are in such disbelief that when you finally believe its already over. Especially today I mean it was so volatile and then one 11am came we pretty much traded flat all day with not a really big move to play. If you had an over night put and held you won. But for me I felt I kept playing against myself and pretty much just traded against myself winning one then losing one then winning one. Thankfully still netted 3x daily profits but not an ideal end to the day. \n\nSo where the heck are we now? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zb6rnwgf2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3565aa6f309f2d91b2bac9f3ff697faee9b3008a\n\nTriple Top confirmed… lets puts 430 in as a MASSIVE resistance to break now. I am actually gonna enhance the line size and color it blue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mznda9g2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0daadbded146272b5aab0b326f599178f41907d8\n\nSo we are obviously still well within the bear channel and now we are trading within the middle of the bear channel which means we could test resistance or we could test support again next. We have been slowly trading less bearish but this was a pretty big knock down. Currently support is at 405 à 390-400 (bottom of support depending on how fast we move) and resistance is at 424 (top of bear channel). After we break 424 we have 430 to deal with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pfs9z0sg2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ae65727e55811bebc27c6fc7c7831f541aaf55b\n\nHere is the current daily with the three bear channels one longer term and the two shorter term. As I had mentioned yesterday we perfectly rejected off the 430 level for the resistance line and we had to gap down to maintain and boy did we. Now the question will be what do we do tomorrow? \n\nSo we reached an intraday low of 409.44 today but 412.32 was pretty much a magnet for us all day today and was clearly support. Once we broke that we hit 410.1 for a bit before we recovered end of day to 413.81. What I am seeing is that 411.7 is a major support now over the last two months. If you look at the Feb 24th candle we close at 410.64 (within in reason of a daily support), April 29th the low was 411.21, May 2nds candle body sit on the 411.7 line, and then today we saw a ton of support in that 411-412 range. I think we are seeing a major support forming here at this 410-412 level on the daily. Even look at the May 2nd candle that did hit 405.02 we close above the 410-412 level and saw a large recoil that day. \n\nMy theory is that’s our bottom for now. I think tomorrow we are going to see an inside range day which means we can trade anywhere between 425 and 410 tomorrow. \n\nMajor support levels at 411.8 à 405 à 402 à 395 (this is actually bottom of the broader bear channel we have been in since January) \n\nMajor resistance- 417 à 420 à 424 à 426 (current bear channels resistance line) à 428\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7zq0ybh2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f2033284968433b95652985519cbc30ed207358\n\nI don’t usually reference the daily chart unless its Friday but I think its important enough to share here. We have had four week in a row of red candles on the weekly chart. We have not done that since the 2020 crash. 412.07 is the weeklys open and as long as this candle closes ABOVE that we will see a green candle to snap the trend. I have a feeling that we are going to finish about that level tomorrow. I don’t think they are gonna give us the red day. As you can also see we bounced this week off the weekly 100ema at 406 and off the support line of this grey weekly channel. \n\nYou can also see the Feb 22nd  (wick) , April 25th and this week candles bodies are all sitting right on this 411 support range. I think this is our default support for now. \n\nI can see two maybe three scenarios for tomorrow\n\n1. We are going to say fuck it all and drill straight to the core and have another -4% red day and touch 395 to confirm support of not only short term bear channel but broader bear channel too. \n\n2. We are going to see a massive rally back above 425 \n\n3. We have a range day/ inside day like I mentioned. We could touch lower support of 405 but most likely would revert back up closer to 420 by EOD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9imnsgzh2rx81.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=591a5c29270951b8cf61a836fb481e0e5a0aadae\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6hcwzii2rx81.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d31cfdd716a5a2a51e265a5d904a5df9280b033\n\nSomething I was playing with earlier was looking at the April 21st to April 26th dip before we finally recovered. It ws about 7.4% of movement down. If we are assuming a similar top was in at 430 we could see about the same range… a roughly 7.4% move down would put us right at 400. Which is in range of tomorrow if we have another massive sell of. Just some food for thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uva5zs3j2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acb665e5139e8c6f52627559f443da641f346322\n\nNotice anything similar about the QQQ chart compared to SPY? Let me show you a little closer… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fpp636jj2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2854cbcf6a2df89a94248319ef92c34f670ccaa7\n\nYes that’s right you are seeing a double bottom on QQQ at its support of 310. Actually wildly enough the double bottom is within 3 cents of each other (May 2nd 309.65 and todays low of 309.62). That’s a pretty convincing double bottom to me. \n\nQQQ traded perfectly within this channel today.\n\nMajor supports- 310 à 301 (bottom of current red bear channel)\n\nMajor resistance- 318 à 324 à 327 (resistance line of bear channel)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wjo1op2k2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67937a450d7c9e82d00dc79179bfd50dc520000c\n\nThe VIX had a hella impressive day trading from its lows of 25.78 to its heights of 33.20. That’s a total 28.8% of movement upward today. The most impressive thing of it all is that when you look at the beginning of the day and pre market you NEVER would have suspected that. It just kept rising and refused to stop. IT was definitely interesting to watch unfold. Now the question is… why? What caused it. Wildly enough… this isn’t even top 10 biggest VIX spikes in one day… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1jotoqmk2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d41e1c29fbfd19c9b56f9f48ba925637723d691f\n\nAight some of you are NOT gonna like this cause this is definitely TA-ing the VIX which I KNOW is a no-no… trust me its impossible BUT there is a pattern. And when I see a pattern imma share it. \n\nSo lets look back at the January/ February dip. We saw a massive spike to 39 à dip to 26.9 à another spike to 32.8 à recovered to lows near 20. \n\nMarch dip.. we saw a massive spike to 37.8 à relief down to 27 à another spike to 37.5 à unwound to 18.5\n\nSo our now April/ may dip… we saw a massive spike to 36.6 à relief down to 25 à another massive spike to 33.2 à will we see relief back down to low 20s?\n\nMy theory is yes we will. Now the timing on it is the tough one. The January peak day till it started to unwind was 5 days. March was 15 days. Currently we are at 4 with tomorrow being day 5. If you include the spike to 33.8 on April 26th we are at 8 days… \n\nSo while it MAY not happen tomorrow… there is a pretty strong case in the next week to two weeks max we should start a bull run. One could argue that markets are waiting for CPI Wednesday before doing so. But there is potential we could start that unwinding now. But looking at this there is a case to suspect we see VIX revisit 35-40 and SPY touch that 390-400 level first. \n\nSo really anything can happen tomorrow belief it or not… How am I playing it? I am playing it bullish for tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a good day I made 3x daily profits but I honestly felt like all I was doing all day was fighting myself. I erased just as much gains I had. Especially during that sideways window from 11 till power hour I kept fighting myself and not trusting myself. But im looking at just under 2x weekly profits this week going into tomorrow and I plan to have a good day trading tomorrow and be conservative to not erase any gains. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kihxb98l2rx81.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f14f75dccd43824be1b123125aff73e78ce132cf\n\nHere is my current positions I am carrying into tomorrow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jbve7yol2rx81.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c05b9b2ee7294a55361fe689f7091436c96f400d\n\nI decided to sell my cash secured puts near 425 this mornign when we LOOKED like we were bouncing before things really accelerated… obviously you see about how that goes. I overall see limited downside tomorrow and next week so I will be rolling those tomorrow before market close, Overall not too worried about those. \n\nI closed out my 60dte put position this morning also (way too early)… the plan with that was to load up as we bull ran for an anticiapted drop. Well now the plan is to load up 30dte calls for a potential bull run this month. \n\nI opened this at 425 and averaged down a few times today. I don’t plan to average down again until we touch 405. I fat fingered my DCA this morning and instead of buying about 3 controls I bought 6 so that was not ideal and now this is a much larger long position then I planned for but sitting here I am looking pretty good. My breakeven for these are 415.2 so I mean we are looking pretty golden especially if we see that move back to 430-440 next week or rest of month. \n\nI also decided to open a 418C lotto at close of day I was able to close that for 10%. So I then opened a new 415C lotto for tomorrow. I feel fairly confident whether it be in the morning or all day that those will print. \n\nAnd my hyperwheel. As you say my current puts I sold are very red but I will roll tomorrow for more premium and an expected bounce next week.

Why? Because Netflix won\'t be replacing current users plans. They\'ll just add a second tier that sits below their current $14.99 plan. Everyone who is currently subscribed will have nothing to complain about. Probably won\'t even notice it\'s been implemented. I\'m guessing it will be somewhere around $7.99-$9.99 and include said ads. It only gives the people more options and get\'s the company another revenue stream. Both great things IMO. \n \n\nFURTHERMORE. I believe (**Speculation alert**) Netflix will be expanding hard into foreign markets. I think they will, if they haven\'t already, invest in deepfake AI technology that will revolutionize how content is dubbed. [See this for an example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfvX2ToA1Ig) Imagine watching Breaking Bad or Stranger Things in Spanish/Italian/Whatever **Natively** where the actors lips are in sync with the dub over.

Inflation is starting to cause issues everywhere across the world, seriously this is happening everywhere.  Countries are starting to limit their exports because of how bad shortages are getting.  \n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine their wheat supply was completely cut off, India stepped up and started exporting more wheat, and people\'s fears of shortages faded away.  This is gone now, yesterday India just shut off all wheat exports to save it for their own citizens.  Inflation is accelerating at dangerous levels when the global economy is slowing.  I think that a 100bp rate hike is necessary but Jerome Powell does not have the guts to do that.  By the June meeting, a 75bp rate hike will be expected.\n\n The global economy is getting worse and worse.  I expect stocks to rebound this week though.  The bond market finally reached this trend line which has indicated every other past recession.  Usually, there is one final rally after the bond market tops though.  The market definitely will not reach near all-time highs but at this point, a bear market rally is extremely likely.  \n\nI still believe there will be a huge panic sell but that day is for sure not next week.

Besides the stock market dropping, why are people bearish on Meta? Let’s take a look at what the bears 🌈 🐻 are saying to better understand risk-to-reward on our META plays.\n\nReasons for 🐻 META sentiment: high \n 1) metaverse is autistic af &amp; Money pit\n 2) competition; TikTok, etc\n 3) missing on earnings Q4\n 4) losing users\n 5) Company wide layoffs\n 6) Lawsuits \n 7) Apple headwinds \n\nLets address the META 🐻 case.\n\nI do agree the pivot to the “next frontier” of the immersive metaverse was dumb af 😂 for a platform barely anyone trusts to even put personal information on. No way I will use it for work, etc , like ever. FB also never created the idea of metaverse, they simply just tried to take credit for it all. Also the amount of investment will be a money pit especially with little ways to monetize. Theres also competition for metaverse and social media platform competition like tiktok. However im neutral on tiktok because it could fade away in a year or 2. But losing users for META was due to competition, however the user numbers are returning with global market reach and can continue up, we will Have to keep track to ensure META isn’t continuously losing users Quarter by quarter. \n\nMissing on earnings Q4: we did see META beat earnings Q1FY22 so back to business for them! Layoffs also help cut expenses. Net income did fall, which im thinking metaverse bs R&amp;D skewing operational expenses. Meta’s advertising revenue in Q1 2022 still grew by 6% YoY to $27bn despite Apple headwinds. \n\nIOS privacy issue per COO is focused on:\n1) Growing video monetisation, especially short-form video-like reels 2) Evolving Meta’s ad systems to do more with less data 3) Investing in AI and machine learning to support our ads infrastructure\n\nOVERALL: bullish\n\nReasons:\n1) META will overcome privacy issues dealing with IOS\n2) User growth will show strength in next earnings as fad social media platforms dissipate\n3) earnings will be beat next quarters\n4) someone internal will tell Mark Z to stick to stealing people’s ideas instead of trying to come up with his own and hopefully pull plug on excessive spending on Metaverse \n5) P/E of 15 = undervalued \n6) Michael Burry bought shares at $222, and he is the ultimate 🐻 \n7) META is not disappearing anytime soon\n8) find new ways to monetize all their holdings like Whatsapp\n9) FAANG apes 🦍 strong\n\nPositions: 300 shares at $201.58\n$10k of cash set aside for call options (not opened yet).

All of Fridays price action was within that channel and today we were once again within that channel. However, today we had the black plague channel where we spent most of the morning until about 115pm when we finally saw a break upward. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgjr4yt2hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a7c14de14b2eee729a8900572d773a0e9b4eb05\n\nUsing the resistance of Thursday and Friday I was able to form a bull channel that SPY traded within today and actually EOD bounced right off of. \n\nAfter hours we are actually seeing that red support line being broken down. \n\nRight now after hours we will watch for 398.5 support (black channel) to hold or break. The 15min and the 5min have both been riding the 8ema downward since about 230pm when we saw a huge rejection at 403.97 for the intraday high. Black channel resistance is 401.6. \n\nI am looking for over night to see SPY break this 398.5 support and test 396.1 near open. There is a chance we could see spy hold 398.5 and test 404.3 channel resistance (purple) at open but my guess being that the bulls were unable to follow through today and with Jpow speaking tomorrow is that we will see a fairly red open somewhere between that 398.5 and 396.1 range. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kchvrhg3hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68606e15c9243609c88ea99326ddac8c8ec2ec03\n\nDaily chart you can see we closed a daily doji today which after an attempted breakout and recovery from 385 bounce Thursday that is not a very good finish. While I expected us to follow through and touch 412 (red channel resistance) it looks like we are very well may head back down for another grey channel support line test near 382 this week. Today the bulls also once again failed to break the daily 8ema which is also another bearish indicator when it was so easily in their grasps. \n\nWe have also seen a dramatic decrease in volume over the last week. We haven’t seen volume this low since April 20th which was the day before a massive dump. \n\nIf we are able to get a bullish day tomorrow 405.2 is going to be the major hurdle to get over and most likely will act in a similar manner 430 resistance did. \n\nWe are also looking at a 404 double top with May 11ths candle\n\nAs you can see the bearish momentum and indications are continuing to add up.\n\nMajor daily supports- 398.2 à 392.9 à 385.4\n\nMajor daily resistance- 402.5 (daily 8ema) à 405.2 à 411 (red channel resistance)\n\nKeep in mind weekly support is 380 and weekly resistance is 445.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0p7pt794hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=438555f2d7688b71c6e6526dc13e465560942954\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwa93no4hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87257b66bc53941571c1a7c4c9ebef4bb3f5c421\n\nSome interesting fed stuff going on tomorrow… JPOW at a future of everything festival? No idea what the heck that is but its live so thatll make markets scared… then we have Bullard (hawkish) at 8am, retail sales in the morning, Harker at 915, Market watch says at 2pm its an interview so that means hes gonna be questioned, then 230 Mester speaks on inflation and at night Evans speaks at 645pm. Plenty of thinks to make the market freak out for sure. Which very well could be why we got a chop range day today. \n\nWe have notable earnings in the morning too from Walmart. Depending on what Walmart posts and more importantly their overall guidance will be interesting to note on how overall consumer is doing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0iavfxe5hxz81.png?width=897&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c83af8826b63459073044bf5b75c64b5db09b291\n\nLastly we can take a look at the VIX… the VIX actually had a pretty massive day today opening near 30.23 and reaching 27.36 at its lows… that’s a drop of nearly $3 or 10% while SPY had a red day. That’s a very important thing to note. In general its not a perfect correlation but if the VIX is dropping and SPY is having a red day that means overall the market is agreeing in the bearish movement and is no scared by the bearish movement. That’s something I mentioned last week that occurred a few times. \n\nThe other thing to note about the VIX is that the last time we saw a big drop like this in the VIX to this level we had a huge recoil the following day back over 30. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0rsrr226hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d547c1fbb30b8e690d1335a12bdc240be4a0d26f\n\nActually now that I see it that has happened two different times. Once on May 4th (FOMC meeting when we rallied to 430 then dumped the next day) and then once on April 25th we closed very close to this same level. So it looks like April 25th was a 0.58% green day that closed at 428.51 and was followed up by a -2.9% red day that closed at 416.1. So that will be something interesting to watch over night. We very well could see the same outcome. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nThese range, chop, theta burning reversal on reversal days are wrecking havocing on my lately. I feel like no matter how much we try they are truly just unplayable. This pretty much is a scalping market and cut your loses early kinda market. Which is even harder when the trend reverses every 30 minutes for 3 hours straight. But in the end I was able to make a few risky plays EOD to recover some losses but still finished down around -3x daily profit goal. A recoverable loss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6n03b3p6hxz81.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4e654a5e20cdefe5f5b3c093ee6a327fd04b154\n\nThe 4dte and 10dte were calls I held over the weekend that I cut the losses on and shoulda just closed out on Friday but they were relatively smaller positions. But the 0dte for -32% and the -44% 2dte puts did the most damage today. I am thinking of forcing myself to add a -25% trailing stop loss onto my positions until we get outta this reversal happy market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbwb6l67hxz81.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94fec8321b5635a345cb053304bfece652f5b5c8\n\nI am carrying this 2dte over night tonight. I expect based on the fact that bulls failed to capitalize on what shoulda been an easy softball pitch to 412 resistance today that we are in store for more downside. I also am banking on a pop in the VIX overnight with all the feds speaking and JPOW and will be holding this in hope of another big dump. Now quite sure we get a -3% days like the last two drops below 28 but heres to hoping right? haha', 'label': -1}, {'text': '$AMZN[removed]', 'label': -1}, {'text': '$SPY 5 reasons why I am going long (short term trade)**Tldr**\n\nRussia is actively working for a way out of Ukraine.

I was watching intraday driving and up until about 1015 it looked like we were headed for another disastrous bear day. But the bulls were able to get it done today and managed to break into the next level up of 396 to 406 and close within that channel. \n\nHowever, we have a couple key things to bare in mind as we head into tomorrow (and these are before SNAP destroyed the markets after hours). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30u5rnrv9b191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06bfce12aff19c1ec22b21262e32645e4d59450c\n\nThe daily chart which is arguably my favorite chart of them all to reflect on everyday has painted quite a grim picture for us. \n\nCouple big things to note here Today was the lowest volume day since April 20th which led to a nice 1.5% red day and another 2.74% red day following that. While we did finish above the daily 8ema of 396.64 the failed to close the candle body over it and we also failed to break into the next resistance level of 398. Being that we failed to break that key 398 resistance that was easily obtainable it would be natural for us to retest support at 392.6 which we are currently trending dangerously close to after hours. \n\nOn the daily I drew four blue arrows. If you note these four blue arrows they all have about the same trend. 3 days to make a new LOWER high point near the daily 8ema that then leads to a massive sell off. The current daily candle much like the other three candles I highlighted all are hammer candles (with the exception of the April 21st candle).  I would have liked to see the daily candle test close to that red resistance line of the bear channel but this could be the next high high before we see a sell off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gnv9xajw9b191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a1847b7e14f9c1e7538be86c03daa26e21328f2\n\nYou guys all know I absolutely love my VIX chart and heres why! I highlighted it in orange this time to show you just how strong this “channel” is that the VIX likes to trade within. Overall the VIX since end of April till now has traded between 28 and 34 for the majority of the time. Lately everytime the VIX bounces off this 28-28.5 range we see a pretty significant recoil back over 30 the following day. \n\nThe most notable times the VIX has gone under 28 and then seen a recoil the following day were April 26th (-2.9%), April 28th (-3.7%), May 5th (-3.55%), May 18th (-4%) and last Friday May 20th (while finishing +0.04 we all remember it had a massive drop from its height of 397 to 380.5). Now we have ole snapchat who decided to take a big oopsies with their earnings currently sitting at -30% (LOLLL), which also took FB (meta) down 7.32% currently and pretty much the rest of the market into the red I would say its all but in the bag that we should see a fairly red day tomorrow. One thing to note is that after hours that 393 support did hold fair strong. If we were to break under 393 it would be fairly easy to assume that we will see 388 tomorrow if not lower. 393 to 388 was a range we traded within a lot last week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f612x48x9b191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed229166f44bd46e899680fd1c1fddfd9aaf2913\n\nAnother reason im a big believe in puts overnight is that on the weekly SPY perfectly rejected tis resistance line that’s now 8 weeks old.  I am looking for a test of 378 support this week next.\n\n10% challenge-\n\nI was traveling today and only played one 0dte put near 10am that some lucky theta member got to collect some premium on is all I will say haha. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/34jr171y9b191.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e6a6b6d10f06e171154310f769a540ac5ad3b5b\n\nI opened this put around 315 when it looked like we might actually close under 395. I felt very strongly about holding this over night ever before snap and everything else. With a current breakeven at 393 with this current IV I suspect that we will see the VIX spike back near 30 tomorrow and us open at or under 393 tomorrow morning. It will be very interesting to see how futures react over night. With the VIX trend, spy daily hammer candle, FOMC minute anticipation tomorrow and now snapchat earnings tomorrow I think a very bearish day just might be in store for us! \n\nFOMC minute release reaction TA\n\nI did a similar post for the probability of how SPY will react when FOMC happened a few weeks ago and figured I would do the same for SPY with FOMC minutes. As you know almost anything fed wise will move the markets fairly aggressively. \n\nFebruary 16th \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/klt1knry9b191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eacd2e97c9648e828d26c301c15a8f9773bc2776\n\nFeb 15th- 1.61% \n\nFeb 16th- 0.11+\n\nFeb 17th- -2.14% \n\nFor February we saw a large gap up the night BEFORE the eve of fomc minutes (so that would be our Tuesday) and then it traded within a fairly tight range all day. FOMC minute day also saw a large gap up over night then drumped all day till FOMC minutes were released and took off on a massive intraday bull run. The following day however was followed by a ginormous sell off. \n\nApril 6th\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1el0aecz9b191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1e4da70b5f211d59513c7959867fe3cfa1ce5ca\n\nApril 5th- -1.26% \n\nApril 6th- -1%\n\nApril 7th- 0.5%+\n\nLooking at the APRIL fomc it’s a little different… so as you can see we sold off into FOMC which tells me the market was expecting bad new however, once FOMC minutes released intraday we saw a dump then massive recovery. The following day of FOMC did see a large sell off intraday, however, this was the time for SPY where we were seeing massive intraday reversals left and right. \n\nOverall both FOMC minute days does look like puts at open is the play and that a straddle right before FOMC minutes might be a great play too.', 'label': 1}, {'text': "AMZN option help Ok, I understand how options work blah blah blah, but with the amazon split coming up, I thought it would be a good idea to buy some 4000$ calls OTM for 8/19.

Well you would be wrong to assume anything in this market. For about the last month or so it really seems like we get about 1 good day a week that has a nice beautiful solid trend that we can follow and the rest are full of these 6-8 reversals and massive wicks and pumps/ dumps and fakeouts. Which makes it nearly impossible to trust those other strong trend days. \n\nUntil the last hour of the day the range was 388 to 393 which is a range we have seen many times before. However bulls were able to break her out above that EOD but failed to close over the key 395 resistance for the next channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z6oozzifki191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4620bace72e3504b29d85131e01e96b35cc0a0f\n\nAnother user in my server posted a tweet that had this symmetrical breakout triangle right here. Overall this uses the peak of May 17th and May 23rd for resistance and support from May 20th and today. I can see the pattern however what I see more clearly and more important is the blue dotted resistance line for this 15min bear channel. This channel as you see below goes all the way back to beginning of April. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/68fkreyfki191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5921e6cee3a64e44f45787cf8e9199eb4a7bedaf\n\n397-398 will be key resistance level to watch pre market tomorrow and at open tomorrow. If we break above that and hold above that level especially if we see a big move like 400 on the 15 min this MIGHT be the bulls attempt at a bear market rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kd3niggki191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96acb7d8c855b3b87526a5332a3596b9379b1d5e\n\nI left my blue arrows up which show the channel resistance touches. Overall we have not had an official touch since May 4th (FOMC day). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfskqnwgki191.png?width=924&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e008268e95c4555b5a32a36095ebcadfd2a86d8\n\nOn the VIX to go along with the 28 to 34.8 channel I mentioned last night we are coming to a decision point. We have been making higher lows since April 21st and making lower highs since May 2nd. We are going to see a massive SPIKE in the vix or a massive DUMP in the vix potentially as early as tomorrow. \n\nBull case- On arguably an easy lob to bears they failed to maximize losses today. The ViX only momentarily broke 31 before closing basically exactly where it opened. Despite the lower volume today bulls were able to but a 180 reversal on SPY today and prevent it from seeing 385 support again. Looking at May 19th there is a 387 double bottom in play. With FOMC minutes tomorrow if there are no surprises the markets could use this as a rallying point as there is not much new news for the next two weeks till we have CPI June 10th and FOMC June 15th. If bulls can get momentum this is there best shot at a 2 week rally. 393 has been a key support range for SPY and being able to close above that today should allow for a pop to the next resistance at 398 tomorrow. Todays daily candle finished in a dragonfly doji. Most of the time this is a reversal candle and could signal upside the next day. \n\nBear case- despite opening down 1% after the first hour it appears that SPY essentially realized there was an over reaction to all the earnings news. The VIX is still hanging out at its lower level near 29 which gives it a higher upside potential tomorrow especially if it holds that support line its been using to make higher lows. The daily dragonfly doji candle can be signaled as a revesal candle IF its at the bottom of a down trend. So think 3 red days in a row with the last being a dragonfly doji (look at May 2nd and really even May 12th for examples) but when the dragonfly doji is after a run up it could signal a loss of momentum and could cause a reversal back down. We closed the daily candle fully under the 8ema today of 396.03 and with the red bear channels resistance at 398 tomorrow (the same one as the 15minute) if we see a hard rejection there tomorrow morning at open we might get further downside throughout the day. The best bear case however would be a morning dump to test 387 if not lower closer to say 385 before we see a massive recovery EOD (probably due to fomc minutes) that results in a huge hanging man candle like we have seen 3 other times now ( April 21, May 4th and May 17th). Yesterdays and Fridays price action failed to break through the 398 resistance level and its pretty arguable that we can expect that resistance to hold strong. \n\nI posted it last night but the last two FOMC minutes have seen a morning dump followed by rally. \n\nFebruary 16th pre market had a massive gap up to 447.75 before falling all the way to 443.93 at open (-0.8%). From open SPY dropped from its high of 444.81 to a low of 441.94 at 1230 (-0.7%). However it held a range of 442.7 to 443.7 from pretty much 945 am to 2pm when FOMC minutes dropped. Once minutes dropped SPY went from a low of 442.02 to a high of 448.06 EOD (+1.3%). IT should be noted that spy closed at 446.61 on the 16th and dropped all the way to 437.11 the next day for a drop of (2.2%) the following day… Interestingly enough the VIX dropped all the way to 24 on the 16th only to end up back near 28 the following day before market closed…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6nmzkm3iki191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20ab2ebb1df42f83bc2793def608189ad4d8fcaf\n\nApril 6th FOMC minutes is much different though. Pre market saw a high of 451.27 at open before it immediately sold off until 8am hitting a low of 446.51 (-1.1%), however the 8am candle saw a huge spike to 451.11 (1.1%) before it then held the 446.51 range till open. At open spy dropped from a high of 447.59 to a low of 444.5 at 1215am (-0.7%). SPY held range most of the day and then saw a pop to opening price before FOMC minutes at 2pm. Now this one saw a MUCH different reaction and arguably this is the reaction we have gotten recently for fed stuff. Which is a spike up, a massive drop, then a massive recovery EOD. SPY shot up to 448.53 then immediately dropped to 443.47 by 230 (-1.1%) then rocketed to 448.93 (+1.2%) right before power hour before it dropped back to 445.32 (-0.8%) and recovered to close at 446.57 after another spike near 448. Interestingly enough the next day also saw a fairly large drop intraday from close of 446.57 to lows of 443.53 (-1.1%) before a MASSIVE v shaped recovery to 450.69 EOD (+1.6% from the V bottom). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ftr2raliki191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ece94b3705580bf73cbeaff71f90c95ab932a222\n\nBoth days saw a -0.8 to -1.1% open and both days then saw a -0.7% drop at open before holding range most of the day.  Unlike the last few FOMC and CPI which have been fairly predictable to be honest I feel like FOMC minutes are not nearly as easy to track. It seems fairy safe to expect a drop in pre market (though we see that spy is now up +0.42% AH) and then expect a 0.7% drop pretty much immediately at open which then leads to a range bound day all day till 2pm. \n\nThis could look like a -1% open= 389.95 at open followed by a 0.7% drop 387.22 range holding until we see FOMC minutes. This is quite interesting to me because we saw intraday today that 387 was such a strong support and we very well MAY retest that in the morning it appears. While this is 100% speculation I will be curious to see how this all plays out in the AM\n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall it was one of those days that started out GREAT and would have ended great if I stopped trading at 10am… we had some odd massive spikes in volume today and one of my puts got burnt really bad in the AM and then when it appeared we were dropping below 388.2 support I entered another put that too would get burnt. Overall one of those days where the reversal is hard to believe and doesn’t really match the technical. The strength of the sell pressure this morning should not have allowed what we saw today. Nonetheless we live to trade another day. It was another one of those days that had we just taken profits at 5-8% profits all day we woulda been making bank. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cqmnt9jki191.png?width=523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a0ff6d96441dfc2a5dc31a859ce170763e87092\n\nUnfortunately ended up marrying some puts over night… hoping my prediction is correct and we see a drop near 385 to 387 to be able to exit at less of a loss tomorrow. Despite AH being green I think there is some fear in FOMC minutes after what happened at the WSJ interview. However, I have fully accepted the fate of these puts. I had an opportunity to exit them on that fake out 245pm sell off and failed to do so. That sell off was very convincing and in a normal market we should have continued back to the LOD not made a new HOD during power hour. That is one of the reasons I do wonder if the bulls are going to be back in control for a while here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h0lieiqjki191.png?width=673&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e24615f75858b224abccf357cfb00025fd477ad', 'label': 1}, {'text': '55k Gain porn today trading 0DTE SPY puts &amp; GME calls', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'NVDA good earnings, price go down?', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Nvidia Tumbles After Supply-Chain Woes Hurt Revenue Forecast - $NVDA[https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/RC6WM7T0G1KW](https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/RC6WM7T0G1KW)\n\n  Nvidia Tumbles After Supply-Chain Woes Hurt Revenue Forecast\n\nBy Ian King and Mark Gurman\n\n(Bloomberg) -- \n\nNvidia Corp., the largest U.S. chipmaker by market value, slid in late trading after Chinese supply-chain woes and the war in Ukraine weighed on its sales forecast. \n\nRevenue in the current quarter will be about $8.10 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday.

That’s made it harder for companies like Nvidia to capitalize on still-growing demand for chips.

They believe that the Fed will be able to hike only so much and are happy to get \\~3% from 10y US Treasuries and \\~3% implied inflation from TIPS.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Staples Investor**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Remember when Walmart rallied in Q4 of 2008? The Staples Investor remembers. This investor is pivoting to safe equities like staples, real estate, utilities and possibly energy. Recession or not, we need to eat, to rent and to turn on the lightbulbs. See you at the next recovery, they are confident they will be up.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Dividend Seeker**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Dividend Seeker is close in style to the Staples investor. With a nice drop in markets, dividends are becoming compelling again and the Dividend Seeker is looking for 4%+ dividends to weather the storm  \n&gt;  \n&gt;t**he Call Underwriter**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Call Underwriter owns a portfolio of equities and sells calls against it. Like the Dividend Seeker, they want yield. They do not believe equities will appreciate during the downturn, and seek the extra carry provided by selling premium.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Tech Investor**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Tech Investor is the new incarnation of the Staples Investor. Maybe 20 years ago Walmart was the safe choice, but the Tech Investor believes that now it’s Big Tech that is a safe choice. AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT are all infrastructure plays and they’re here to stay.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Short Seller**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The short seller believes in doom and gloom and will use inverse ETFs or even put options to stay short the market. “*The downturn has just begun, just wait till QT starts!*” said one of our most bearish users.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Note: QT is Quantitative Tightening, the unwind of QE.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;t**he Cash Hoarder**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Cash Hoarder thrived in a time of low inflation and reasonable real rates. Now they are facing a real challenge as real rates for short term bonds are deeply negative, and they are thinking maybe about moving to Japan.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Note ‘cash’ here is used as a synonym for T-Bills of 3M or lower tenor.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The Dollar Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Dollar Bull knows how markets work during a recession. When the global economy falters, money flows back to the big ole US of A. The Dollar Bull is not unlike the cash hoarder, but they have a cross-currency view of things - and will pounce back on oversold foreign holdings one day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The \\[forbidden word\\] Bull**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The \\[forbidden word\\] Bull has discovered that a popular asset class cannot escape correlation with the equity market. After \\[forbidden word\\] suffered yet another 60% drop from peak, the \\[forbidden word\\] investor is eyeing that $29.7k level from July 2021 and thinking “will it breach or rebound?”.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**he Gold Bug**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Gold Bug knows that the precious metal is where the buck stops. Come hell or high water, recession or inflation, Gold is the ultimate safe haven. Russia war? High inflation? Recession? Gold is the answer.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Conclusion**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are many valid approaches to invest for safety during a slowdown. If we blend together all these styles we get a defensive portfolio made of Treasuries, High Dividend / Defensive stocks, Gold, some \\[forbidden word\\] and a collar (i.e. a sold call and a long put).', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Just signed a personal loan for 250K to afford one TSLA leap contract (expiry June 2024) - Richness here i come![removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'TSLA puts - should would could have closed in profit lol', 'label': 1}, {'text': '$82k on SPY 250P 8/19/22', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Those weekly $420 SPY calls will DEFINITELY work out for you', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'SPY fighting to catch a breath above 400', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'I sold my TSLA shares and yolo’d into 3x leverage ETF because it literally cannot go tits up when you retards actually think “the competition is coming” and pushed it down to $620', 'label': -1}, {'text': "BABA going to make moves like TSLALook at 10 year {only} chart of TSLA &amp; also of BABA; BABA going on only of 8 years now since ipo.\n The similarities on the technicals are just as TSLA was June 2020 after its peak from a previous approx 3 years before 70’s to lower 40’s. \n BABA total geopolitical stock manipulation has taken and held it down though is one of the 10 only companies in the world doing the numbers it is doing.

Trade the opening hour today, a few intraday moments and power hour today. Overall I have a similar plan tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kko0kjvbw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4835140d30388ffff2aa332d493307662aa8c4f2\n\nOverall I didn’t miss much today… mostly a pretty unexcited and expected range day. Mondays (todays the Monday of the week) lately have been pretty sideways trading. Afterhours is showing some green but nothing to overly write home about yet. However there is a support line that the 15min charts holding fairly well and Friday we saw an afterhours rejection of the resistance line Friday of the bull channel and spy intraday today failed to break that high. \n\nHowever as we take a look at the daily and the weekly we see a little more detail of possible moves. Overall I will try and be a little more detailed here due to no post on Friday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7i0b7gywbw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07060e2199267be23baa67c6f5cc953f299d131c\n\nNote the highlighted circles that I will later speak on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oqt5l7sxbw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46c2066249e60daa56d5bca6522a15dc22527b67\n\nOn the daily we have a very nice bull channel we have been trading with in since May 19th with support being established on May 20th. Friday we saw a pretty much wickless candle close and I had mentioned in my server Friday I felt about 75% confident in overweekend puts but I didn’t enter then as I knew I would be camping and was unsure of service. Overall those would have printed today. We have followed that wickless candle up with a beautiful red doji. While hard to tell it is technically a gravestone doji due to the candle body being slightly shifted below which is actually a signal of a reversal of trend. Previous daily tends ending in a doji like today have resulted in massive sell offs. \n\nWe also have a gap on the daily from 407.04 to 407.7 that will need to be filled. \n\nIn addition what we saw today was a rejection intraday of 416.5 which now makes a double top there on the 15min chart. In addition if we look back to April 26th to May 5th this was an important price level. SPY failing to reach this Friday and hard rejecting it today during a bear market rally in my opinion is a bearish sign . I believe SPY has lost its bear market rally momentum and we are going to see a retest of lower support. If we look at the May 2nd and May 6th candle 405.6 was a major support for them (and resistance on May 9th/ 10th). It is likely we see a retest of this area before we go any higher. That would be a 1.7% drop from close today. Everyone is saying this is just like Marchs rally but it really in many ways is not and this candle finish today is confirmation that it is not going to be the same result. I think many people are about to get really burnt on that. \n\nI adjusted my probable/ improable zones a little as you can see. \n\nIf SPY is able to continue this rally though, we could see 427 as fast as Friday. That is a likely high and rejection zone for SPY. If we managed to break through that we could see as high as 438 by June 7th (right before the next CPI). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b58otmi3cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1f194e97ba671f4558f34f77e80b5e2d7decc3f\n\nOne thing to note on the weekly of SPY is that it FAILED to close and break above the weekly 8ema last week. Today did see us break it momentarily however we are not at a doji on the weekly and we are seeing SPY well below the weekly 8ema again. Likely support is the weekly 100ema of 405.92 (remember I said 405.6 was a key support area earlier… that’s likely to be tested)…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19kvqz44cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f0447485c59723a540b5b0de4b7e267ff0b6f25\n\nApple has the same finish today with a near double top doji and a gap from 144.34 to 145.26. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v6olau4cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718a7e4f39a829d012f6079422599be1e4a77f2b\n\nYou guess it… QQQ has the actual double top with a doji on the daily AND a gap from 300.92 to 302.42.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ebdvpi5cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34610e7b0fd28436d0312c42a5fe98deebf293b8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unhlhzx5cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57af63c3d97ff72be8736c16cf7ec6d62b977bb8\n\nInterestingly the VIX opened with a massive near $2 gap up which is most likely the result of the morning dump. However once we breached 30 for a short period of time we did see it sell off the rest of the day before settling with 26 as its low. It never managed to break its Fridays lows. \n\nThe things I am seeing with the VIX is that we are still making lower highs BUT we are really struggling to make lower lows too. I drew a fat red line at VIX of 25 as the line in the sand. We will not have a true rally under VIX drops back under 25. \n\nA few things to keep in mind as we head into tomorrow. Tomorrow starts a new month and we know how Spy can change tunes fairly quickly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/geqfscw6cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4870ebb67d04d4e3961ba3e92516a31ccaf82430\n\nWhile this is NOT new news… this is enough to “spook” the market tomorrow in my opinion. Plus we don’t really know what this is going to look like. \n\nOverall I am bearish for tomorrow. If SPY can hold the 405 support area either tomorrow or this week I suspect we could get a bounce and rally further up towards that 430-440 levels. However, if we break below and especially close below 405 I do believe we have some more downside headed our way. This was enough of a bounce to shake people outta long puts and trap people in long calls to start the trend back down. \n\nIf SPY is big green tomorrow and recontinues the bull run on good momentum today like we saw last week I will too remain bullish till we see closer to that 430. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nDidn’t trade much like I said today (honestly kinda felt great)… hit half my daily profits during opening hour and just vibed till I found a good entry). I liked it. Reminded me of my prime trading days that I really need to get back to. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjbyt0j7cw291.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7a5dd7b4a0bb787215a87761db792bc8dba206\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubw582y7cw291.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95556354368bcd30bb4b4035c54b8a5492bc6b00\n\nOvernight I decided to swing this put… bought it at 1.33 premium with expected VIX rising back near 27-30 again I will be looking at some nice profits as long as we open below 410. Will look to evaluate where we open in the am and sell/ buy pressures along with the VIX trend to decide when to lock in profits or take an L.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Alright boys, recently found out people with too much power have been tracking every thing I do for years.

Good… now lets jump into it. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjhvnwulp2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d893775ce8e52cdc1bb685b2c142950795fae13e\n\nClassic spy today with about 11 reversals… Morning started off hella bullish with that 1%+ green open and we even tested the major resistance of 416.6. It looked like we were early on consolidating ready to bust through resistance and finally see the 420s… Well low and behold we were actually preparing to dump the rest of the day. Somehow SPY still managed to pull out a green day. Its actually funny because these bearish days are being masked by a small green day close. \n\nIn the last month we have had 11 of these non trend days &lt;1% +/- and only had 10 trend days &gt;1% +/-. Overall that’s 50% of the time that SPY is finding itself in some sort of chop. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/911ikptmp2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f614968318013f986d5d5bc99683faa04c288746\n\nDaily wise we DID break the bull channel support. However, there is a case to be made for slight error adjusting the bull channel down to look like this. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j77euqenp2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaa329e4ef482cd30597a2ca41fc7199a764c908\n\nAs you can see the more important thing we see here today is the purple downward channel. As you can see we are stating to make lower highs now. We are yet to make a lower low which would happen if we break 406.93 this week. This is using the sideways chop from May 27th to present. \n\nI will closely be watching the black bull channel and the purple channel tomorrow. If we are to drop another candle below the black support line which would happen unless SPY see another large gap up above 413.7 tomorrow (key resistance from 2pm today). And bulls would have to run all day long with no stop to keep us in the black channel. If this black channel breaks tomorrow I will start to look for the next leg down. Which with CPI on Friday its highly likely we will see it very soon. \n\nPurple channel gives resistance at 416.2 and support at 404.3.\n\n409.4 remains major support though. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ud90j32op2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae3db89e7b25cdc0e10fe48b746cfd6bac3d0209\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwzrhwnop2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cbba05b5b33ffdeaed1429c16b749219e82e3bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6gx5h6pp2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9954d3d741ac93dc7fa7a935871111e352422cfc\n\nMonitoring the VIX you will see that we today broke through the downward resistance line. We are finding ourselves at a break out back to 30 or break back down to 20 trend here. We did break through resistance today so one could assume we are going to see 30 by EOW especially when we look at CPI on Friday. Now the one thing to note is that since Thursday we have been stuck in this 24.8 to 25.8 chop zone. The VIX cant quite unwind and the VIX cant quite rocket up either. Until we see a close back under 24 or back over 26.5 I don’t think SPY is going to see this sideways chop and reversal happy days stop. \n\nToday is another one of those days that drive you nuts. Everything and all your indicators are firing and looking perfect the trend looks as trendy as it cant and you enter seconds before a fat reversal. I am still not quite sure this morning what caused that 11am dump nor the nearly 1% spike on the VIX. But that moment cause SPY to go into a downward trend. At 2pm the volume and momentum was all there for a recovery too and yet again got clapped down quickly. \n\nmy best advice right now... is bunker down if you are struggling.... cut your position size by 1/5th and just vibe... dont trade unless you feel 10000% confident in your position. If you dont want to risk anymore get a TOS paper account. There is no reason in this market not to take a break from real money... we need to protect our accounts and our futures... we can not make bad choices that lead to accounts getting blown up. \n\nToday and friday i am afraid is alot of what we are going to see for the next months or so until either SPY finally reaches capitulation OR we finally recover from inflation and markets feel confident feds not going to crash this market. we are close to neither of these and until we see one of these play out most days we are burning money. \n\nWe need to go heavy on the one trend day we get (those 3-4% days and go beyond light on fuckery days like this). It appears to me that if we are not seeing VIX fully track with the trend (so vix up and spy down…. Vix down and spy up) that we are going to be stuck in chop. With CPI coming up on Friday it will be very interesting to see what the markets are going to do especially with FOMC following up 3 days later. \n\nI am having a hard time being bullish or bearish here. I think personally we are going to chop in this 407 to 417 range until Friday and that’s going to decide whether we are going to 440 or whether we are going to 360 again. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall got burnt on some calls this morning when I was looking for the 416.6 breakout and from there it was just an untradeable day. Made two small scalps and that was it. Looking forward to cpi and fomc being overing and hopefully getting back to some trend days this month. I don’t really care if its up or down just give me some sort of direction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77p7a3eqp2491.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c12a7c8f23f53f1459ac9845f1f5f6b27d828d34', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'You heard him, load up on $AMZN', 'label': 1}, {'text': '$AMZN down big time.

I am going to be very conservative in my trading for the foreseeable future I have decided to cut my position size by 1/5th and my daily profit goal by 1/5th. Right now this is a tough market and until we get back to the clear trend days and a non reversal happy SPY there is no reason for me to trade full position sizes nor be aggressive. \n\nAlso to any of you guys using ARMERs momentum need to realize its function and limitation... this is NOT build for quick scalps (well i take that back it IS but its missing the money flow aspect of it). this shows sustained momentum trends... this shows the trend we can trust and confirms momentum... this is to be used in addition to the 8ema (my opinion not his)... we can look at just momentum and easily make some trades... HOWEVER, we need to be correct and time it correctly... \n\nthe thing about this too is this may give one or two perfect trades a day (like the call i took earlier) we need to be patient... this isnt a enter as soon as it flashes as it can flash off quickly if momentum isn’t sustained.  \n\nFor me this is how i use this.... SPY, spy breadth, SPY MACDBB 1min, VOLSPD, VOLD and ADSPD (advancing/ declining stocks) have to all be the same confirmed momentum and the VIX has to be trending with ADX and momentum (opposing obviously) before I enter. \n\nIF any of them is missing i wont enter (this is my new rules after so many reversals and fake outs) today so far its saved me from 4 potential trades i would have entered but was missing one aspect.... \n\nAlso, for me i use this as an exit... IF we are in a trade and we turn off momentum then im out. we can always re-enter but if we lose an indicator i like to exit... this is my new trading method. and also how i recommend trading this market until we get back I not a smoother SPY. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ejvb4g1oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6928bec10fe338e6f20cfd51a98f155348ba0394\n\n(Neutral- no momentum on any)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4pbicw1oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=232e47b622f40c12842dd2f46b530e1fdfc9e934\n\n(Confirmed bullish momentum entry)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xtfl4f2oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25b8a1746b689af5d5593c725fe19a3ff103a078\n\n(Time to exit from bullish entry)\n\nObviously this is an extremely conservative approach to trading but as I have said numerous times now this is how we need to trade this market… There is no reason to be aggressive right now. The markets not giving us much anymore. We need to be in asset conservation mode right now. Take what we can get and GTFO until the markets ready to be how it used to be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vi932d33oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05c7b5168e9ebb6d6ce187946325eaed9132afd0\n\nOne would assume when SPY opens -1% red with an elevated VIX that we would be drilling all day long correct? Well one would be wrong. Today we saw the VIX hit a peak of 26.24 right before market open and then from there it never stopped unwinding all day long. This unwinding of the VIX was critical to SPYs morning run and the EOD run too. However, looking at the VIX one would assume we would have a 2%+ green day not this measly 0.96% green day BUT technically with the morning dump and pre market dump we did see about a 2% green intraday move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvw6wql3oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ccd2189de4cbe522147d213f5fbfec0336a31fb\n\nTrend wise you can see that we clearly broke out of the bull channel. However, we are maintaining the purple “sideways” channel which is really a slightly downward channel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kw0dm564oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=513cf99790b1dadecda4ad20c0410ccdb17ed77d\n\nWith a slight tweak we might actually be in a slightly bullish upward channel. Personally I favor us topping out, with today confirming the break of the bull channel and we will now start our downward decent. Especially with CPI Friday and FOMC next Friday I have a hard time believing that we are going to be very bullish long term. \n\nOn the daily I highlighted three big green candles. As you can see the last two big green candles were followed by red days with the most recent one being a significant gap down. \n\nOn the daily we did close over resistance of 415.5, however, we failed to breach the higher lows trend of the channel. Tomorrow daily range for the purple channel is 416 to 405. If we break out of 416 then we might be in that black channel I mentioned, but again I favor at best some sideways action. I think there is a lot more pressure on this CPI then the previous ones personally. If this is a miss we are gonna see a bigger reaction then we do most CPIs.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mk9l3ys4oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e22cb60a39515fc04f21fe18509f5e11e61c4591\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkk0ovb5oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b4a3a7818bf00e8a587c5d21749b581fccff644\n\nAs you can see the VIX is slowly unwinding I mentioned yesterday that bulls would not be able to get any sort of footing if we did not see the VIX break under and hold under 24.8. Well today they finally did it. We are not approaching a longer term support line for the VIX. It will be very interesting tomorrow to see what the VIX does… If we see a massive recoil off of this 24 support range I bet we will start our ascent back to 30+ VIX with CPI and FOMC being the fear inducing catalysts. However, if tomorrow they unwind it further I will be looking for 20 VIX and will be anticipating that CPI on Friday will start the spike of the VIX. My working theory is that MM are unwinding the VIX slowly but surely without really bumping SPY up all that much in order to all the VIX to properly spike during CPI and FOMC. If they hadn’t unwound the VIX then CPI and FOMC would almost certainly give us VIX 40+ and SPY sub 360. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday I went ultra-conservative and honestly I kinda enjoyed it. I made a few mental “entries” today that were aggressive (and definitely not following my trading method above) and all of them got burnt to crisps. So going heavy conservative and getting a W today felt great. I missed the morning run and the last thing I wanted to do was FOMO into SPY today. The mid day was set up till about 1230 for a massive dump back to where we opened but all of a sudden at 1230 we got a massive volume spike which subsequently led to 415.74 EOD. \n\nI also took profits quicker then I would have liked to today as I felt the 3dtes were getting massively theta burned and IV crushed to the point where there was little reward to the risk. All three of these positons went on to see 20-30% if not more gains, however, with the IV crush, theta burn and overall lack of trust in this market I took profits when I could and was happy to sit the sidelines today. Profits are profits. Came in at 69% of daily goal today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bktf5kx5oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=71f83d02f6ca386bb71c90d4634783a489738399\n\nAnd for those of you wondering how I can comfortably cut a position size in 1/5th this is what I would say. Whether you are trading 1k or 5k nothing should change. You should make the same entries and same exits. Your risk should be the same. Nothing is changing in my methology of trading, however, I am just taking the risk of position size off the table. I am eliminating one variable till I feel we are at a place where I can re-enter full position size wise.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'AAPL announcing its entrance into the BNPL market', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'spySPY CAN GO EITHER WAY....WANTS TO RALLY...WANTS TO TANK...EVERYONE WAITS ON INFLATION NUMBERS FRIDAY...INFLATION PEAKS..SPY RALLYS ...INFLATION RISES...SPY TANKS....I MADE MY MOVE ...WHATS YOUR MOVE?', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Buyer’s Remorse: NIO Gets Cold Feet and Abandons Its Partnership With AMD Just Two Days After the High-profile Announcement', 'label': -1}, {'text': '6-8-22 SPY Daily TADespite probably one of the most uneventful and boring days ive ever seen on SPY today was a great day and also showed us quite a lot in my opinion. For the first 3 hours of the day SPY maintained the same $3.1 range that was established within the first 30 minutes of trading. The best opportunity of the day was the 1230 dump. From there we just consolidated within a $2.35 range the rest of the day. Overall an extremely uneventful and extremely boring day to trade. Pretty much all but about 30 minutes of the day was untradeable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcjhazrhbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c00dc5253e6821152f32d2a1d875194243d75411\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac84l37ibh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60570d930b71bbc6bed47c6cadaab54c138185ef\n\nWhen we look at the daily chart I think the party is about to be over. We have a couple things forming here. We have that blue triangle which you can see we peaked on June 2nd at 417.44. From there we have now established a lower highs resistance line that has been rejected 4 times including today. In addition highlighted in a red dotted pattern you can see a VERY large ascending wedge which I anticipate we will break tomorrow and will lead to the downfall where we will see a retest of the 390s at minimum over the next 2 or 3 weeks. \n\nWe also maintained that purple channel that I believe we will eventually see support break on it and that will be the time to play some longer dated puts. I think that time is coming very soon. \n\nI fully expect us to revisit 408 support tomorrow at a minimum if not lower closer to 405. Currently 406.4 is the support line of the current sideways channel (406.4 to 416.6). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5kiimo0jbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36e03677135d5eb17c2df677918483e7ccb27d34\n\nOn the weekly we are seeing nearly a triple top (double top for sure) at 416. As long as SPY doesn’t close over 416 this week I fully anticipate the weekly to break that support line at 406.5 next week if not this week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/stnadtzjbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a22e2d869d89f39e94443e26e044323df73c2ce0\n\nI mentioned that the VIX was approaching its crucial support line yesterday in my TA and today I mentioned in my server that 23.8 was the key to watch. Well the VIX bounced right off 23.74 today and EOD failed to unwind back under 23.8 closing just below 24. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o27nlenkbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=286dc30095dd029ac5088285f7a5e2cc05b4bac7\n\nI will be looking for the VIX to start its way back toward 30 tomorrow. With CPI coming only two days away now I suspect markets are going to start getting the fear back in. There has been a lot of chatter about this CPI and a lot from fed members to the point I think we are going to see a bigger miss then expect on CPI. I would be surprised to not see some of that fear set in tomorrow. I will be looking to see the VIX end of day near 25.5 and start its ascent up to 30 Friday and Monday next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojs3am9lbh491.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c202e0ad543621988fb095091d23f9d549e70354\n\nLooking at the last few CPI releases you can see that surprisingly the last 4 of 5 CPI eves actually were green days with 2 of them being significantly green. However, the April 12th CPI we had a massively red day. Looking at the VIX trend For the April 12th CPI we actually saw the vix the week leading to CPI rise from 18.8 to 25. The May 11th CPI we saw the VIX go from 29 to 33 the day of CPI. Interestingly enough looking at the VIX trends 7days prior to CPI this is the first CPI we have seen the VIX unwind leading to CPI. We have over the last really month (actually the last CPI on May 11th) seen the VIX steadily unwind down to where we are not at 23.95. \n\nWe have seen the VIX go from peak of 37 on May 2nd to current day at 23.95 and SPY has only gone from 380.54 (may 20th) to 417.44 (June 2nd) a 9.6% bull run. Oddly enough the same time it took the VIX to go from 34 (March 9th) to 24 (March 22nd) Spy also moved about 9% going from 415.12 to 450.58. \n\nI have two working theories. The first is that the fed and markets know CPI is finna be trash and its finna scare the fuck outta the market. We then have a follow up FOMC meeting only 3 trading days later. With these two major VIX spiking catalysts I have a theory that they purposefully have been slowly unwinding the VIX knowing come Friday, and next week the VIX is gonna rocket again and they don’t want the VIX over 40+ yet and they don’t want SPY back under 380 yet. \n\nMy second theory is we are going to see a great CPI and a reassuring fed on Wednesday at FOMC. If that were to happen we could see the VIX unwind the rest of the way from 23 to 18 (just like the March rally and VIX unwind). \n\nIn March we saw the VIX go from 34 on March 9th to 19 on March 29th which moved SPY from 415.12 to 462.07. 11.3%. If the VIX continues to unwind we could see the last 4% of the rally which would bring us up to 424 range. Oddly enough this tracks with one of my major daily resistance lines perfectly. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pi5ibi6mbh491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a017899cb053a14705b8737d4ce1e24f92625a87\n\nDo I think we see 424 at this point? No I really don’t. I really favor that we are going to get a CPI that’s comes in over expectations (currently consensus is 8.3%). \n\nLast CPI we saw them for the first time predict that inflation has essentially peaked saying we would see 8.1% instead of the previous 8.5%. We DID see a “peak” with a 0.2% decrease from 8.5% to 8.3%. They are now calling for that same number of 8.3%. Now if and when this CPI misses not only is it a miss of expectations its also confirming that inflation has NOT peaked which is a major deal. I predict we come in somewhere near 8.4-8.5%. \n\nIn the off chance we DO see 8.2% or lower that would be a major catalyst for the markets though as it would confirm for 2 months in a row that inflation has “peaked.” Now of course in reality if we look at the world its bullshit there aint no way anythings peaked… But of course they look at the numbers how they want to… \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was actually a GREAT day. I didn’t make my first trade till 1230 on that big drop. I stuck strictly 100% without wavering to my 5 of 5 in agreement momentum indicator and let me tell you she did not disappoint! It saved me from taking 3-4 trades that I would normally have entered. However, EOD when we were attempting to breakout during power hour it was showing 5 of 5 bullish. However, that’s where the overall trend of the day and relationship to the 8ema and comes into play hugely. IT was against trend so I couldn’t bring myself to enter the trade and im glad I didn’t as it obviously came back down… \n\nMy only red trade today was an apple trade I attempted to enter in congruence with my SPY trade at 1230ish. It never saw about 3% and I closed when I closed my SPY put for profits. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv48qmvmbh491.png?width=755&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6ad6871946a8fe5792d224bee1b9ee423b43d37\n\nI decided to go ahead and enter some puts over night tonight. I think even if we open green that we will see at minimum 407 tomorrow intraday. However I favor us opening under the daily 8ema of 410.92 and braking down most of the day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/73ajjidnbh491.png?width=683&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da42e5d21d9f964d8e89812c3ae23c7343141ade', 'label': -1}, {'text': "TSLA 260K YOLOhttps://imgur.com/a/3kLG6GI\n\nYo tards, this is coming from the 6k-440k guy in my ROTH account...got another ~180k cash that I'll deploy if it dips any farther...I have a hard time believing with gas/oil prices spiraling out of control, that TSLA isn't going to benefit..\n\nThey already are the market leader in the space and high gas prices only lead people to dive in EVs further...\n\nAs long as Elon doesn't fall off the bandwagon in his quest for TWTR, this can't go tits up", 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Somebody’s just casually dropping 6mill on AMZN…', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'How will SPY close on Friday 6/10 ?&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/82073l6yyl491.png?width=2121&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c63fcf1a91af847490feda94f68f22fc3165d19a\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/v8ikdi)', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Buy AMD please[removed]', 'label': -1}, {'text': '[Question] Can someone explain why Pelosi bought ITM calls on $AAPL and $MSFT?First of all, I am referring to this: https://www.businessinsider.com/nancy-pelosi-stock-options-congress-trading-2022-6\n\n\nI genuinely do not understand why she bought in the money calls on Apple and Microsoft.

Some people are not realizing how bad the 8.6% CPI report was... the highest analyst estimate was 8.5%.  Our government is not being honest about the current economic situation (not that I would expect them to be).  The federal reserve has been consistently wrong about inflation over the past 2 years.  There is one thing that they are being honest about, inflation needs to be brought down fast.  Jerome Powell already knows he needs to save reserve currency status and bring down inflation as fast as possible.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/l99m90dxx0591.png?width=1479&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ac8bd7ba32d355e0f2708a9f72cac2a26df7b74)\n\nThe bond market has always been a very good indicator of what the federal reserve will follow for the effective rate.  The 6-month and 2-year yields are what I like to check.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/9f10iba901591.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ada35e9b96a8b4f2a8975ab47a2d2a61bde5d98)\n\nThe goal is for the effective rate to reach the 6-month yields, a spread of more than 50bp in the 6-month yields and effective rate will most likely signal a rise in rates.  There are 2 possibilities for next week when Jerome Powell decides how much to raise rates (Purple Line - 75bp rise, Blue Line - 50bp rise).  At the current 6-month yield a 50bp rate hike would equal a 46bp spread from the 6-month yield.  I think the federal reserve will be watching what the equity markets are anticipating... shown above if the 6-month price continues to drop and the yield increase to around 2.23% then I will say there is a 99% chance of a 75bp rate hike.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9tgyaf931591.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7de398e8afd784af07e63ebfbd7d1bb8210fd65\n\nThe 30Y - 5Y bond yields were also inverted this week,  the bond market always shows the economy's health... and right now it is warning of a recession.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pht8ks04a1591.png?width=1362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ca461acebd5b28e07faafee5ef19ef14c0773ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vuqefvpv41591.png?width=1268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3c37c9a7bb6d75c89c0c0da0e6871a296c2d1b2\n\nAnother problem is that our government thinks the economy is strong, this is because consumers keep spending and spending.  This spending is not lasting though and has started to slow down from inflationary pressures.  People are now borrowing money and using their savings just to keep up with inflation.  This cannot last much longer.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Federal Reserve Calander](https://preview.redd.it/wjuyr99lf1591.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef02627fc8e7e7291768fc110d2675623a4d522b)\n\nAlso, 8:30 AM on Tuesday is PPI\n\n**Recap**\n\n$SPY should be rangebound again this week, there shouldn't be any closing price under 388 or above 400.  If 6-month yields rise to about 2.23% expect a 75bp rate hike, otherwise 50bp.\n\n[5-day outlook is kind of a joke don't take this serious](https://preview.redd.it/c5kbndtvh1591.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f609c770c7d8cbaf806cd193ecdd9204b40901f)\n\nI will respond to every comment!", 'label': -1}, {'text': 'It’s Fkn 109 outside.

However, what JPOW says will be very important tomorrow and will guide the market for the next month or so in my opinion. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ct00en0ttn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cb8f680e1802d66dc0000c14b8c26f6c9f921c8\n\nIt was a fairly untradeable and frustrating day today where there was no momentum and no continuation. Overall we saw SPY make 14 total reversals intraday today. The biggest of them was the opening hour. We saw an immediate sell off followed by a near 10mil volume 15min candle that was arguably trying to breakout only for a ¼ volume candle to come in and take us back to drill down. After that first 45minutes of movement we just saw sideways burn and failed breakout after breakout. 373 support looked extremely strong all day until PH when we broke through it only to see a fairly impressive rally EOD. Bulls really tried their EOD but failed to close SPY green. A very frustrating and untradeable day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/27s7mb0utn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d95986965d5ba89e1794343d602a3a3bbbdfbff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwbez7qutn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76d52d72c284340eb039671655d25b2d3038a18e\n\nThe daily does show that we are attempting to hold 373.5 as support now. It was encouraging not seeing a massively red day today also. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzoz8shvtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2242c634c6473212631bae0df9e0b48ab979fdb\n\nThe weekly bounced right at support today. IF we get a bad FOMC tomorrow and we drill we are going to be looking at not only a massive weekly gap but we are going to break fairly large support and be looking to bounce off the weekly 200ema at 363. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5lqvw56wtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea9213e2509ea1a1665489ab13b02071bc48ff4a\n\nThe VIX was a big part of the frustration today in that it just didn’t wanna find a trend. Overall until EOD it was unwinding but once she hit that 32.1 level it rejected fairly hard and bounced causing that EOD sell off. The VIX really needs to get under 32 and look for the 20s again for the bulls to have any hope.\n\nWith FOMC tomorrow there is bound to be a lot of fuckery. Most likely we will see the morning chose a trend from 930am till about 1030am and trade sideways till about 1230pm or so when we will see it inverse itself and trend closer to opening price. \n\n2pm is when the FOMC rate hike is released. We should see a fairly significant move with that. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f175tlywtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e544028dd690f3bd3b3dbf409b59b06c1e61217\n\n  \n This was last FOMC as you can see at 2pm with the rate hike we were fairly indecisive forming a 15minute doji… JPOW started talking at 230pm. Markets found their bottom and from their rallied until close. (this way May 4th FOMC).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y06ylenxtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63dedce4c59778d289322a41c9f0801be1e7b87b\n\nMarch 16th same thing… we saw markets at 2pm react to the FOMC rate hike and by 230 when JPOW started talking we were finding bottom and at 245pm we were in the trend we were going to continue in and rallied till close. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rz9affmytn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b895ce71a9e491d3dbf1757ec89cdba9a91aa6e2\n\n  \n Now for January we didn’t have a rate hike but I believe ole JPOW finally got scared about inflation here and scared the markets… so at 2pm when FOMC was released we saw the doji (like may 4th) and then when he started his presser at 230pm we started our downward trend by 245 we were confirmed. However this trend peaked at 3pm and then slightly recovered. I don’t really equate this January one to much since there is no expected rate hike so we really mainly should focus on May and March. \n\n2pm- March 16th( -1.01%)  May 4th ( +/- 0.5% both ways… up first then down)\n\n215pm- March 16th (+0.5%) May 4th (down 0.3% then up +0.8%)\n\n230pm- March 16th (dropped 0.3% and then rallied 1.2%) May 4th (down 1.1% then up +1.5%)\n\n245pm- March 16th (+0.5%) May 4th (+1.2%)\n\n3pm to 4pm- March 16th (+1.32%) May 4th (1.4%)\n\nMarch 16th- from 2pm open price dropped a total of 1.5% in 30 minutes then rallied 2.5% from 230pm low till 4pm close.\n\nMay 4th- from 2pm open price dropped a total of 1% in 30 minutes then rallied 3.61% from the 230pm low till 4pm close.\n\nSo how do we play tomorrow? Well I would be looking for about a 1% drop from the 2pm candles opening price so say we open the 2pm candle tomorrow at 375 look for 371.25 as a 230pm bottom. From there you can expect about a 2.5% to 3.6% green rally. \n\nSo you could either open a straddle with 0dte and about 3-5OTM strikes (do this at like 155pm) set the take profits on both to 30-50% and i would be shocked not to see both of them fill. Or you could open both and set 100% take profits on both and play it that way. One of them is almost guaranteed to hit 100% and then the other will be free. Most FOMC meetings you can easily turn 50-100% profits a few different times. \n\nAnother way to play it and probably the better way to play it is to wait till about 230pm for a bottom (or top I guess) and buy an option then. Most likely after 230pm we will see a great move one way or another. I would look for the VIX as a guide for this too if VIX is rocketing and you are thinking calls you are wrong… but if VIX is unwinding and you are thinking calls then you are right. By 245pm we should have a fairly clear direction and you should be safer to enter a play. \n\nFor me I will be waying my options of a 30% take profit straddle placed at 159pm and then I will look for a play at the bottom near 230 to grab a fairly OTM option on to ride till at least 3pm. \n\n10% challenge- \n\nOverall a fairly frustrating day. I took some calls at 10am when we looked to breaking out and everything look fairly bullish. But of course those got wrecked pretty quickly. I had planned to hold those till tomorrow thinking we would see the big green rally but once we lose 373 EOD I knew my hopes of seeing a green close for those were low and I took the L. I played a few scalps last 45minutes that all pretty much washed eachother out. Looking forward to tomorrow and FOMC being over and hopefully we get some clearer trend and momentum days. Overall there was just zero follow through today and by time momentum was confirming a trade it was reversing already. These sideways VIX days are brutal. \n\nToday was a good day of patience and recognizing when the setups aren’t working in your favor. Sitting cash sometimes is the hardest thing we do and not FOMOing into every play. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2axheei1un591.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97b47ce2055cd19205a8061baf8bc389e3ef4c4e\n\nSitting cash gang overnight.

These days are both exciting and scary at the same time. They are some of the most volatile days we will see. MY friend sent me this image this morning that shows we are the 3rd worst performance ever through 112 trading days! YAY us! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcza2mzn2v591.png?width=684&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c9e930a6af81d607e6476bdebf453c0294cd0f\n\nOkay I posted this trade breakdown last night as my anticipation of how to play FOMC today and then I posted this breakdown of where SPY should move intraday. Lets see how we did…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jbuw9lo2v591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f1d4e85d577314d58f6ae025ba4921f841473eb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1iuygw2p2v591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53124fd369f1851f244bc6ccc4c7fb8f61a665d3\n\nWe fake ripped to 379.98 (0.48%) and then dropped by 230pm 372.12( 1.6% from 2pm candle open) and then we rallied to 383.9 (3.1%) from 230pm till EOD. This thing played out almost exactly as anticipated. \n\nFor me I was able to capitalize on call bought on the 230pm run up when JPOW started talking. I got nervous and didn’t buy in at 372 like I told myself I would buy at the low made at 235pm and watched my qued call go up 50% before my eyes in about 5 seconds. I bought in around 375 and rode some 378C up. I had initially set a 100% take profit order but got nervous of a massive recoil on that nearly 2% candle (which did end up happening the next candle) and went ahead and set a 10% trailing stop loss when I was up 80% unfortunately due to volatility it triggered and hit me with a 56.5% gainer. While still amazing… I left a lot on the table. BUT I protected myself from downside loss which is most important being that this was a full port (hehe oops), however, had I waited about 15 seconds longer my 100% take profit would have triggered. \n\nAlso I mentioned in my night TA I was going to PAPER TRADE a strangle to see how that behaved. Both positions were opened at 130pm and by 2pm I would have been able to close both for 25% gains. I also saw both positions hit 50-60% profits but that was it. \n\nNext FOMC I will be playing a strangle with 5 OTM strikes with 30% TP set at open. I will then wait until 230pm when JPOW starts talking for the bottom/ top to be in and enter calls or puts. \n\nyou know whats really wild... the fact that the feds actually leaked exactly what they were going to do before the meeting... i mean thats nuts they are that scared of the market crashing that they went ahead and leaked the plans during a fed quiet time so that the markets could price it in...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6oh6lwp2v591.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37cfc97a22e7136a3829764a5795d315b1c91c7a\n\nThe one funny thing about todays HOD… is that it was 8 cents away from getting SPY out of a bear market, however, we hard rejected there and never made a new high or even retested it. So where does this all leave us?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2v3a1vdq2v591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2df949354b26c8bdb60debc7e417730e4bf29cf\n\nWe now actually have a symmetrical triangle which is known as a breakout/ breakdown pattern forming on the daily. With back to back DOJIs and today technically being considered a dragonfly doji (bullish) then we might actually be in store for some further upside here. Today we did chip away at $2.09 of the $7.89 gap that was left on the daily. \n\nWe now have a $5.66 and a $5.80 gap left on the daily to be filled. The $5.8 is the closest gap at 389.75. There is a pretty good case here that SPY could fill that gap tomorrow which would require a 2.78% green day tomorrow which is definitely gonna be hard to do and would require the VIX to unwind from 30 to 25 minimum to do it. \n\nThe one thing I am watching on the daily is that the Monday candles body stopped at 380 which makes it a resistance line to watch. Yesterdays candle failed to close above that resistance and today we also failed to close above it. This is a tough spot to be in as there is an equal case to be made that we break through 380 to gap fill tomorrow and there is an equal case that we partial gap filled today and will retest support down near 370 on the daily. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5j91uvwq2v591.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d4a983d66ef2f1bc58f85d305bdc467ead5afd7\n\nNow if we factor in previous CPI data it is about a 66% chance we open red and see a red day tomorrow. If I had to take a wager I would say markets like May 4th over reacted to the JPOW news (hint- it was NOT bullish nor good for the economy or anything) and tomorrow will see an inversed move. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nI was busy with the kiddos today in the morning and didn’t really look at the computer till noon which is fine cause I planned to leave all my BP for that 230pm move on SPY and it surely paid off well for me! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcbs2gor2v591.png?width=109&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c7fe20568827cb3b5893982689190db898c358\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otdio2bs2v591.png?width=583&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5319fc12e9a53f13535a5af3faed426a7e1ffc21\n\nWhile it was pretty cool getting that full port win I look forward to going back to my conservative momentum based trading tomorrow.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Cashed out all my SPY puts and sent it all into 6/24 GGPI $9 Calls ahead of next week’s vote on the Polestar merger', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Puts on $AAPL.

Its not much but its there and we closed the lower gap from 370.94 to 372.12 from June 15th open. \n\nThe biggest takeaway for me from todays close is that we saw the June 13th support of 375 actually act as resistance today with closing. It looks like TV adjusted close to 375.07 but before it was 374.95. Overall to me with the VIX back over 30 and SPY back to 375 this was a fairly bearish close. I think this was a low volume breakout attempt at barely 75mil and that we will see red the rest of the week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cwgtvumza1791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e57526ea336f3f1a735365618cb1c2b4a253b97\n\nThe VIX attempted to break down today but stayed locked around that 29.8 to 30 level almost all day long. The main reason I am not sold on the bear market rally continuing is that the fear in the market did not unwind enough… had we been able to get VIX closer to 28 or below it I would be sold but right now we are stuck near 30. I don’t really think we see upside tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbsl95i0b1791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=862999a483f7869c8e9aea4a9561011dbff23d8e\n\nEOD we also broke through the June 16th and June 17th resistance line so there is a case to be made we see much more upside on the VIX. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wlf5xg21b1791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4eea96b67954bb4d8a3f2120844402a9fac3eaef\n\nTomorrow morning we also get JPOW himself testifying on monetary policy.

Of course with a big enough IV pump from the VIX and what not we may see that be close to 363-364.

If you\'re like me, you are getting paid nothing at a job that you are gonna lose by the end of July, yet you still dump all of your measly pay stubs directly into the market like the degenerate gambler you are.  Some may call it irresponsible, I call it making lemonade out of the most bitter of lemons. \n\n**The lemons:**\n\nWe all know a recession is coming. We all know inflation will not stop with these pathetic 75 bp hikes. We all know that the housing market will crash. We all know that the stock market will crash. The fun and games from 2021 are over. Historically, retail traders get absolutely fucked under these conditions, and at the end of the boom bust cycle, the rich get richer as they extract wealth from the retail bagholders. This will happen no more. While yes, food and gas are beginning to become unaffordable and it seems like the end is near, I like to stay glass half full. **I aim to turn this "once in a lifetime" market turmoil into an event of massive wealth creation, and you should too.**  My plan has 4 main phases which I will list below.\n\n***THE LEMONADE:***\n\n**Phase 1: Accumulation (UVIX)--** Currently, I am in phase one of my plan: **buying as many shares of leveraged volatility products as possible.** Since Jan 2022 we have seen much market volatility. Although the market has sold off 20%, there has not been a large move on the VIX. This is not concerning to me. It seems to be indictive of organized selling and exiting from institutions. This has given me time to buy UVIX and UVIXY on the dips as they oscillate during the sell off. Looking at 2008 this same set up can be seen. VIX did not move much at all as the S&amp;P sold off 20%. It was not until the capitulation when VIX spiked. When will capitulation occur? I\'m not sure, but I am damn sure that I will have all the capital I can spare in volatility products when the day comes. I will begin to sell when VIX cracks 50, but my price target is 60+ or possibly 70s.\n\n**Phase 2: Bridging the Gap (SVXY)--** So VIX pops off, now what? Well if you look at the graph below, VIX spikes 4 whole months before the S&amp;P bottoms. So the question is, what do I do with all my gains from the volatility squeeze? I can\'t just have them sitting around uninvested. Answer: SVXY. SVXY is a leveraged inverse VIX etf. As VIX drops from the 60s to the 30s I can make an over 50% return by buying and holding SVXY until the market finally bottoms. This will allow me to make money while I wait to buy the REAL dip \n\n[Capitulation in 2008, VIX did not spike until well after an S&amp;P bear market.](https://preview.redd.it/7ivzxihz6f791.png?width=3781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39d19e97ca69310bc92cc801fded758cea87f247)\n\n**Phase 3: Buying the REAL Dip (SPY)--**  S&amp;P Price target? See burry tweet below. Once I buy SPY, I will finally be able to rest, as the previous steps will require extreme stress and paying more attention to the market than any autist should.\n\n[Barring a miracle, I will not consider buying the S&amp;P until it nears 2000.](https://preview.redd.it/iolvthqj7f791.png?width=1625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b763c3f2c10fb782ccc3c5b514f0353c946c9ac3)\n\n**Phase 4: Own Real Assets (Buy a House)--** Honestly getting tired of typing at this point. We all know that for each % increase in the federal funds rate, housing prices drop by like 10-20% or some bullshit. On top of this, the housing market moves much more slowly than the equities market, so I will have ample time to shop around after the slow inevitable decline of the housing market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never thought owning a house would be in the cards for me (especially after I lost all my GME gains betting against Tesla). It\'s time for redemption of every bear who went short too early back in 2021. **It\'s time for us retail investors to weather this bust cycle and end up with MORE money than we started it with.

However, we had a beautiful V-shaped bottom though around 1pm that led to an EOD rally hitting my price target of 378.5 before EOD. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/83kzb2guwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc48fda7e70e9cb9d956e0b996a8fa48ad4556fe\n\nJust a textbook dump and V-shape recovery rally. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d0bgwr0vwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e1a62eef9503773dac406bbd5625a3213deb9f\n\nSo where are we at on the daily? Well we closed at 378 which is bullish as we finally got away from those 375 closes and closed over resistance. However, thanks to that mid day dump we didn’t get the 380 run and close over that I was hoping for to feel confident in a bull run tomorrow. \n\nAs you can see I have highlighted the May 12th to May 17th daily candles which look oddly similar to the current June 17th to June 23rd candles. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f3tkie2wwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbf2313ea9a297c10dbbf548ef7831138c6b03f9\n\nI am watching this closing as a hanging man daily candle which could signal the top/ a reversal. Last time we had it was on May 17th and it led to a massive -4% day with a -1.2% red open. I have my suspicions that is what we could see tomorrow. We failed once again to break through the daily 8ema today. \n\nThe blue line support from June 17th and June 22nd was broken today (I readjusted it here to see if this will be new support going forward). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38q6d9nwwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c38d838515e4c1953a152dfa664fe5f1bc3a2f07\n\nHere is the setup I am watching on the weekly and then ill lay out the bull/ bear scenario. \n\nWeekly still has the gap from 389.75 to 383.90 and as you can see major resistance is 380 and then 390. I actually was fairly bullish going into today suspecting we would break through 380 resistance and see 390 EOD tomorrow for a nice rejection and weekly gap fill to lead to downside. However that is quite the stretch now. \n\nBull case- After a bullish finish EOD today bulls look for a nice continuation tomorrow breaking through 380 resistance and close the week out somewhere in that 380 to 390 range (384 will be resistance after 380 using the June 15th candle). With a close near 384 bulls look next week to see a green week and fill the 390 gap on the weekly. If that gap fills and they can keep the momentum we MIGHT see a run as high as 400-405 next week. \n\nBear case- with this hanging man candle on the daily and struggle after struggle for bulls to keep any steam going this week. We either see a confirmed rejection in the morning at 380 or we could potentially like in May see a pretty significant gap DOWN over night and see a bleed back near 370 support to end the week. Ending the week on a bearish tone bears would look to retest the weekly 200ema and 2020 support line at 363 and attempt to break through to start the next leg down. \n\nAt this point it really is bears and bulls neck and neck. I would favor a big red day tomorrow personally. We opened the week at 371.89 so if we do see a bigger -3.4% red day tomorrow we could actually see a support test near 370 to finish the week out red. Most likely scenario is a green week finish to the week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4x94b8xwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca8200b15bd206658db12d3cacdae7d56817811b\n\nI have been trying to get a read on the VIX all week long but really cant. We have obviously unwound all week long from 34+ on June 17th to now making allow of 28.7 today but we just aren’t seeing the true unwinding of SPY like we used to on these big bull runs. We are seeing pretty much small movements followed by sideways trending all day. Overall we are pretty much dead smack in the middle of 25 and 35 for the channel with a small favor to the downside. Overall my thoughts are still that VIX wants to revisit 25 support level which would favor the 390 theory but there easily could be a pop back near 33 to 35 VIX which would favor that 370 test. Overall this market is full of mixed signals and multiple scenarios. \n\nI have said it before but even though we often are missing 1 to 1.5% moves overnight for the most part we are better off not playing swings right now. The market is just far too unpredictable and far too easily swayed to predict a true move right now. Looking back over the last three weeks that I have been tracking my swings my win rate is about 55.5%, however, the last two weeks I have spent 2-3 days recovering the losses from my swings. The first week though that swing gave me a nice reward. It’s a tough market to be in right now. On one hand we have these wild swings overnight that we can clearly capatlize on for some impressive gains IF we get the right direction and position sizing but on the other hand with the unpredictability of it and the intensity of these swings if you are wrong you are -90% wrong at open.  \n\nNow that we are on the topic of swings lets look at the last 4 weekends and see if there is a play to be made… its kinda interesting to be honest. \n\nMay 31st- -0.4%\n\nJune 6th- 1.1%+\n\nJune 13th- -2.6%\n\nJune 21st- 1.7%+\n\nAs of right now we are seeing every other week a big red then big green open… so there is a chance we open big red on Monday. Is it worth the play? Perhaps…. Gonna see where tomorrow closes us. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nI got caught in some SPY calls and UVXY puts this morning before that hard dump. I shoulda mitigated my losses but took a chance it was an over-reaction to JPOW. Waited till the bottom and averaged down the SPY calls and then the UVXY puts once I got out of the SPY calls. I missed an opportunity to take 3% green on the SPY calls but protected myself with a -10% stop loss and triggered that. Unfortunately of course it ran hard af power hour so I missed on the big gains. Overall though I salvaged a really bad day to a really great day today. But I got lucky. I should have better mitigated my losses and taken an L when I saw it go against me and saw that 11am reversal doji. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wd1cnuuxwg791.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8a14e7f9e0cd7eea2390a709621961fe7de0e7a\n\nI have had a great week after overcoming my weekend swing big loss. I am at my weekly profit goal currently and I will look to tread lightly tomorrow. Fridays are always tough days and I have seen too many Fridays erase a weeks worth of gains on a bad play. Patience has really paid off for me over the last three weeks and I do not look to change that tomorrow.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Full ported yesterday and 0td SPY 380cThis month I have gone from 26K&gt;$900&gt;12.5K&gt;1500&gt;10.4K.

We had two realistic scenarios that could have happened today one of them being the gap up over 380 followed by 390 gap fill and they ran her right to 390.08 in the last seconds of the day. \n\nToday was a goofy day to say the least. We had some great momentum going until about 1015 am then we just died. We had the Roe vs. Wade decision today that I believe took some steam out of the markets and we had a Biden presser. We traded flat from 10am until 245pm when we finally started making a move upward. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9g6lg9bgum791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b769ec7486d8a4004ea8f9b58ef7eb9905bd452\n\nNow the one weird thing about the EOD today is that we actually saw a pretty significant pop in the VIX AND we saw SPY pop hard at the same time. While its not a perfect correlation VIX to SPY usually they inverse eachother. Today was odd in many ways. IF you look at the 15min chart we actually had one of the strongest trend days I have seen in weeks where we never even closed a candle below the 15min 8EMA however they held this pinned down for almost 4.5 hours before we finally moved upward and it wasn’t until the last really 10 minutes that we saw a true pop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryl7c2xgum791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48bf9d8c1ff84756468d54c60de230458b04b678\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pi251cghum791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b32797b00c117b48d6c23ca3b3ddae18ea825a1\n\nWe broke through the red channel today so lets get rid of that noise on the chart…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pcva4t0ium791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8929a71f5b0e16e7a6313d7a8c5561c6a2cbb3b4\n\nWe have quite a few things developing on this daily chart. Now we FINALLY filled the June 13th gap EOD there. Which would make me believe we are about to fill the June 10th 401.44 gap next week. \n\nIf you look at the daily I have drawn with blue dotted lines a rising wedge that is forming. This is a reversal/ bearish pattern. It gives us room to see 392 on Monday if we are obeying that resistance line. It also give us room to see 380 support test Monday to fill some of the gap we left on the daily chart today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1v8t0lium791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdce5cc1151ab394d5f29d00af09e3d4ef8f488b\n\nThe weekly gap was filled today too when we hit 390 EOD. \n\nBull scenario- What I am seeing develop is a few things here that could be bullish. In general SPY doesn’t leave gaps for too long on the daily and now that one has been filled we might fill the next which gives us the though of 402 next week. This rising wedge could actually become a smaller bull channel. If it turns into a bull channel (we would need to break through 392.5 to confirm) then we might see a run to 402-404 next week. 401.44 is the exact gap fill and the tan bear channel gives resistance of 403.5 for Monday and 402.5 for Tuesday. Also looking at the weekly now that the gaps been filled and arguably the weekly 200ema is support we should see that black bear channel broken and see the red bear channel tested near 403.5 during the week. \n\nBear case scenario- despite a pretty big 3.18% green day today there was a severe lack of momentum for 80% of the day. However, we had some very bullish volume. We can use that rising wedge as a possible rejection zone for Monday which gives us potential to see 392 before we reject. There is also a history that once a gap is filled the price action will hard reverse. The biggest bear case I am watching currently is that we died right at 390 EOD. IT filled the gap on the daily but that 390 is also a major resistance zone on the weekly. It is possible that the previous major support zone will now become a major resistance and we will see a gap down Monday to stay within that black channel (383 is the top) and then we will head back down to retest the weekly 200ema near 363. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4tgsx2ajum791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95753666dad49c8c32cd398701f47f21e5f0c0d0\n\nNow the VIX is something im trying to get a good grasp on. We have clearly been unwinding since last week but its been very choppy. We also saw a pretty aggressive EOD pop on the VIX that was out of the normal. There is a case that since UVXY spiked first (based off VIX futures) we actually might have some people going long on puts next week and we could see a bigger red week next week. Based off that black support line we shouldn’t see VIX break below 25.5 next week before we start our ascent back upwards. \n\nIf VIX sees 25 Monday and we gap fill 402 that could cause the VIX reversal and SPY reversal I was mentioning above. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nThis was actually a really great week for me. I made a REALLY bad trade on UVXY today though. I had entered at a perfect time and almost immediately saw 25% profits. However, I believe so much in the fact that the VIX was going to break 27 and SPY was going to see 380 that I held and didn’t lock profits. This was a big mistake. I did not see UVXY rocketing EOD like that before power hour and being so far OTM and 0dte I got wrecked hard and fast. Tough loss there. \n\nOverall this week my indicators worked really well for me and I was very patient in my entries. I was discussing this in my server EOD but I have been considering whether or not I want to remove VIX from my entry requirements. Currently I have a momentum indicator for SPY, VOLSPD, VOLD and VIX all on the 1 minute that I use to enter a trade. When they are all 4 bullish or bearish (aligned) I enter. However, I am seeing lately that VIX is not aligning much with SPY anymore and I am wondering if I am limiting myself. Today I kind of put that to the test EOD. I entered a 0dte during power hour based off volatility switch showing a trending state, spy breaking resistance on the 15min chart and the SPY, VOLSP and VOLD 1 min charts all being bullish. The play hit 100% for me and would have been 200% had I not sold. If I listened to VIX I would never have entered that trade. I wonder if in this market if volume is the true king and if I should listen to SPY and volumes only. I may do some experimenting next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cek84zwjum791.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cb32862857fa80a82371556b1bb5f532b8fc406\n\nOverall a great week.

We had a $3.92 range total today which is only 42% of the 10 day average.

Bulls and bears could both have a fairly large argument that they were right. But the more I study this chart and thing about today and the VIX I feel the bulls are the winners today and this week (or at least tomorrow).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h00q2xp0v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67734994c25a0cc825918783c6895255dd901ba6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eeenyia1v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac08aa42f99e12d23dd58668cdf3cf7ea9382d82\n\nLooking at the daily we got a lot going on. \n\nBlue arrows- one could say today is a hanging man candle, however, a TRUE hanging man (reversal) is supposed to be 2x longer wick then body (thanks to Trav11s for pointing this out). If you look at the first arrow from May 17th you see the true hanging man causes a massive drop the next day… however, if you look at the one from June 23rd (granted this candle was fighting between a hanging man and dragonfly (bullish) doji candle) we actually saw a massive gap up the next day. \n\nGaps- we currently have TWO gaps below us now… 381.37 to 378.83 and 370.18 to 369.38 and we have one gap left above 401.44 to 395.78. The gap above is the biggest and longest over due. \n\nDotted blue bull channel- we now have a potential blue dotted bull channel forming that uses June 17th and June 23rd to form support and a “projected” resistance using the June 13th candle. This channel actually gives us a ton of upside and gives us plenty of room to see that 402 gap fill. \n\nBlack dotted bear channel- we have a projected bear channel using June 13th, June 15th, June 24th and June 27th (today) as resistance. We then projected support off June 17th. This channel would prevent a upward gap fill and would favor both lower gaps filling by EOD. \n\nRising wedge (bearish)- using the black dotted RESISTANCE line and the blue dotted SUPPORT line we actually are seeing a rising wedge. This can be considered an exhaustion trend and could signal a top is in. However, the one issue with rising wedges (and falling wedges for that matter) is with enough volume you can break through this and turn then into a channel instead of a wedge. Or the wedge can be extended. \n\nToday we broke below the daily 20ema of 388.6 numerous times and I believe that’s why that support held so well plus it was a bigger support from earlier in May. We closed essentially on the 20ema daily EMA today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fn2ontx1v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c44622dc75da0a7305a5a65c98b9f875791f32\n\nNow the VIX is still continuing to fall and we have yet to reach key support range of 25. But we are getting close. The one thing im seeing and its highlighted by these big blue arrows is that we are getting some fairly large spikes on the VIX that are all falling right around this resistance line and once those spikes hit we seem to be unwinding the vix the rest of the day. Today again EOD we saw volume and SPY in a bearish momentum trend while we actually saw VIX dropping. They were all pretty disconnected again last week. \n\nLooking at the big red lines on the vix we actually are seeing a similar falling wedge that appears to perfectly inverse the rising wedge on SPY. Now again if VIX falls hard enough it will go right through this support line and this support line is not nearly as strong as the resistance line. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rywq74i2v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=038b20c59452de2f017207545993b6235d6bc46e\n\nBy tomorrow and maybe even by open tomorrow we will see whether the VIX is going to break the falling wedge or not. \n\nWhere am I at? Whats my bias? \n\nWell I actually was fairly bearish last week and we didn’t drop and by EOW I was then bullish. I this morning was feeling bearish for the week but with the 388.6 support holding so strong and today being hella low volume and VIX still unwinding I am actually feeling bullish. I think that SPY Wednesday we will see SPY fill the 401.55 gap on the daily (it could do it tomorrow with a 3.3% green day though…). \n\nBut I al looking for a 401.55 gap fill and potentially see bigger bear channel (the one dating back to January) resistance test. If we were to gap fill on Wednesday we actually would see a perfect gap fill and channel resistance rejection at 402. That is my anticipation for this week. I think once the gap fills though we will most likely be bearish though but best case bulls could break this out to 410 range. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kf2d9o33v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50832e89bc83b90f3809bc4b860f34037749359f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4cumltp3v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=490940f0e8822ae5affb5b74640e86a7e6f85faa\n\nThis is something I used to do a long time ago but I honestly stopped finding predictive value in it cause it was so close to SPY… someone suggested with the inconsistency of SPY right now that it could be a good time to revisit on ES (SPY Futures) TA… well lets take a look at the daily on ES and see what we got. \n\nOverall the rising wedge I had mentioned on SPY actually is invalidated by the ES chart. So if you look at the Black dotted line using June 15th and June 24th and resistance points today we actually wicked through that line which means its invalidated. So we shouldn’t see that SPY rising wedge play out (however, we could re draw the black line using todays top and see it play out later this week). \n\nThere is a light blue bull channel using the support line from June 21, 22, 23 and 24th that seems pretty strong. We did not touch that line today but there is a case to be made that if todays (June 28th) candle was to drop we might see it touch that point which shows support at 3870. \n\nNow the daily candle for yesterday on ES actually is a gravestone doji which usually when seen at the top of a bullish run can signal a reversal. \n\nBull case for ES- we will look to ride the daily 20ema support at 3896.5 overnight and look to test the new rising wedge resistance line at 3965. Bulls want to see a clean break through 3965 and eventually will look to retake that 4020 level. This 4020 level is an approximation of the 401.55 gap fill that I spoke of earlier. \n\nBear case for ES- tonight bears will look to break under the daily 20ema of 3896 and tomorrow break through the daily 8ema of 3854. Once 3854 is broken the blue dotted support line from this rally will be broken. Once that is broken bears will look to break down 3761 support next. \n\nOverall looking at the ES chart I don’t feel that my bias for tomorrow has really changed at all. I am slightly concerned by the gravestone doji candle from yesterday but its not always a given. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday not a great day I entered a 0dte put this morning when we broke through 388.6 the first time with a 15min candle. We had tons of momentum and VIX was in our favor. However we then saw two full candles with ridiculous wicks to the upside on them. I was looking for a fakeout recovery then further drill that never came. Tough loss there. \n\nEnd of day I entered another 0dte put that eventually saw 50% green only to go to -80% green and then was able to thankfully close it back out for 0% on a quick wick. I fully misplayed that and shoulda taken profits. I had a 100% take profit order set and once again we had all the signs aligning we were going to see a breakdown closer to 386 EOD but it never came. Hindsight I shoulda taken the 50% gains to recover 50% of that morning put loss. Live and learn and die but greed. \n\nI was not going to play any positions over night and honestly I probably shouldn’t have played anything overnight but here I am in a 394C 2dte. When I started to dig into my TA and that 388 support more I felt that was bullish and not bearish. \n\nI entered these UVXY 14.5C this morning when it looked like we were breaking out. They never really saw green as it almost immediately dropped. I am using these as a hedge for the week as I do think by time Friday comes we will have filled the Gap and seen a VIX bounce at 25-26 which will cause a spike in the VIX like usual. I could be wrong but I felt compelled to hold this since its 4dte and I know UVXY loves to move in mysterious ways sometimes. \n\nOverall not a great day for me and further case that if I stopped trading Mondays I would be way more profitable. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcvagcf6v8891.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=627dcda0929c1dd67c288fd6b6e91eb0abd94e42', 'label': -1}, {'text': "$AMD on a Times Square billboard last nightIt truly is beauty &amp; the beast &amp; a rather handsome beast I might add &amp; since the WSB panel is\xa0unanimously bullish on the semiconductor space, wanna say something.

I suspect us to break through that black dotted support line of 373 tomorrow. \n\nWe now have a red dotted bear channel forming.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lpy24o30wt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c3dbc549c97d2344064c4c9740351b28d4f0e84\n\nIf you note on the daily using the black solid line and the red dotted support line we are actually seeing a huge falling wedge which means we just might see that 300 price target by end of July if things don’t improve. But we are on a clear path to 358 SPY right now. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf4p55r0wt891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5453ff594b8e0b9e6163ded15551a6ee3f7c416\n\nThe weekly chart is what interests me the most… we are actually seeing a huge falling wedge forming there with the floor near that 350-358 price range for next week. I have a feeling now that we 1. Rejected breaking through weekly 8ema and 2. Broke down out of blue bull channel we are going to start our next sell off. \n\nWe have been seeing for about the last 6 months now that the last week or first week of a month we get a change of trend… we are now due for a sell off. \n\nAs much as I would love to say this is the time to go long 60-90dte puts I just don’t think it is…\n\nWhat I think we are going to see is that SPY is going to trade between 360-380 until end of July. End of July bring a shit storm of things for us. \n\nWe have Junes FOMC minutes releasing July 6th,  CPI on July 13th, FOMC on July 27th, GDP on July 29th (which most likely will be negative and confirm a recession), and then we also start earnings around the 2nd to 3rd week of July. \n\nI have a feeling earnings are gonna be dog water and with this last two weeks of July shit storm brewing we MIGHT have one more bull week or at least sideways week left in us before we finally see capitulation and get the next move down with a  price target of 300 SPY by September. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nAfter having a killer week in theory that I turned into a shit week by failing to take profits all week out of pure greed I refused to do that today. Had a great day for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v8at4f2wt891.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b3b215780207a2910d530a4714c18fc354fc8a0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0fvgtxy2wt891.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03252e8319ed9c452339e038bc418ae77f79045a\n\nMy ONLY saltiness about today is I KNEW we were going to sell off EOD when we kept rejecting off of 380 but I was too scared to enter after yesterdays fuckery. I finally entered and had a position up about 40%... I decided to lock in a 25% stop limit sell order on the 0dte JUST IN CASE she turned against me. But I had VERY VERY strong intuition she was gonna see 100%+ profits… Well she triggered at 32% as you can see above in my log. I then only had $26 in BP left so I bought a 0dte 373 to let ride and of course as you can see within 4 minutes it was up well over 100%... It hit 150% at its peak. Had I just held on and believed I would have had 100%+ profits. \n\nBut that’s how this market goes. The days we don’t secure profits like I did today or at least protect us from the downside is the days we get absolutely rocked like I did yesterday. And the days we do take profits are the days it perfectly hits our PT. The 11.4% and 10.7% I played earlier were the same thing a 10% stop limit just in case that triggered and both those went to see 100-200% gains also. This market is such a mind fuck on being able to trust the chart and indicators but also protecting yourself from tom-foolery. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Friendly reminder to anyone NOT in my server\\*\\*\\*   \n I am going to be out of town starting tomorrow as I am flying to vegas/ grand canyon to get married this weekend and then the following weekend will be vacationing to see my family. I will be very spotty in my posts. I will have a weekly TA up that I plan to be very detailed (got a 5 hour flight to write it) and then i plan to trade next wednesday if I can. Other then that besides a random quick daily Ta if I have time I wont be back to full time trading till July 12th when I return from vacation fully. After that I have no more trips planned and kiddos go back to school beginning of next month.', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'The first AMA for the new and exciting project of web3; Metacard is going live in 16 hrs.

What is very very interesting about this CPI is that this is the HIGHEST level of CPI that the fed has predicted yet. Remember just two months ago they tried to tell us that CPI was peaked yet here we are with a prediction of 8.8%. \n\nMy thoughts are that with the Feds projecting CPI to be 0.5% higher than their last projection which usually misses by about 0.2% at times I suspect we are going to get a reading of 9% CPI. \n\nWhen we get this 9% CPI we are going to see the VIX massively spike which will cause us to dump hard af. We then will for the next 2 weeks while we wait for FOMC, earnings and GDP continue to dump (I made a post last night about going long on VIX/ UVXY calls I definitely recommend you read it as it adds to all of this too). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9jfishi47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1ce646bbdfe5b81247539cc0abdb93511072043\n\nI will be SHOCKED if CPI is anything but 9% but I took profits on almost everything but my UVXY calls cause I don’t trust this market or the fed lol. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/drqk190j47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9b811ecb36df38de701e9ef660dc0f803812893\n\nOverall the daily looks clear as to where we are going… I mentioned last week we looked to be in a 370 to 390 channel and that is exactly what this week has played out as. I would be shocked if we don’t see 370 tomorrow (-2.7% day). If we break through 370 and close under it this week I think we are going to be setting up for 340-350 by EOM. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aaih33lj47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e429b5ba985120726ee44900f825a15aa780105\n\nMonday I called out the 3810 level for ES futures that I expected us to see. Here we are hitting it intraday today. PT for futures is 3675 by EOW (-4% from 3820). Overall we finally see a close below the daily 8ema on ES futures which we were waiting for to have confirmation of down trend. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvzov25k47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb6fc1e00bc53da78f0f83ac0b9dff88277ab6ea\n\nThe one weird outlier today was the VIX. Even with that massive 1.3% sell off EOD today from 1pm to 345pm we never saw the vix break 28. Which tells me that the VIX (fear) did not lead this sell off but rather sheer volume. We had some pretty low sell pressure for how strong of a sell off we had though. We only saw -1.5 at the peak when most big dumps see -5 to -10. \n\nI am highly expecting the VIX to finally spike tomorrow when the market get rocked by a 9% CPI. A 25% vix day is likely and would put VIX near 35. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1x4agyk47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12bd0b8710ab0331cc1f04d977c82cea0168bdca\n\nOverall the server had a great day today. We definitely took profits too early but hard to say no to 30% and 50% gainers! Great day overall for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ht4w0ol47b91.png?width=777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b47abe9addc123b95552ba8c4f433de0c3376af3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvcmcv2m47b91.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=733818a597f13c3debc2f3fef92a2ead5ef812a1\n\nMy plan WAS to carry some 5 otm puts overnight. However, I decided to take proifits on everything instead. I also wanted to hold those 3dte puts till Friday but I just couldn’t say no to the gains. While I have high conviction we see a bad CPI and a big dump tomorrow im not chancing gains if I don’t have to.   \n \n\nI decided to hold my UVXY calls as I still have not see the VIX spike that we are waiting for. The fear hasn’t hit the market yet and tomorrow it will. And if im wrong then im wrong but with these UVXY calls in the off chance that CPI isn’t too bad I should be able to get out still with a small loss. It was the smartest play. But if im right and Cpi is trash we are looking at vix 30-35 and UVXY 16-18. They will print hard.', 'label': 1}, {'text': "Bought SPY 0DTE puts at the DIP.

It makes sense that they would do it on a random ass day instead of when we all expected it and were all positioned for it. \n\nNow the question is…. Was this a over reaction or was this the beginning of the next big leg down? My vote? I think we bounce tomorrow and maybe once tesla reports we actually go down… That’s my opinion… Ta wise it could go either way. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fok0jak40ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28e30b1eb997165164e0ebd3f9bcd3aca5ec195\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8to2o250ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=840ae7b2280e9298a3a0834da27c61ea9469adc2\n\nIf you look at SPY and ES futures weekly chart you can see we broke out upwards from the descending wedge which should be bullish, however, they both perfectly rejected their weekly 8ema. That rejection is actually more bearish than the resistance line break out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sprxl9q50ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271a9db03de763e23746f08626cf09190fcb016f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntcoltd60ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6226f5d610bd7127cbefa47c3dd81dd91296839f\n\nNow the daily charts for SPY and Es futures look pretty bearish to me. On SPY we see we nearly perfectly tapped the downward tan channels resistance line and came just short of the sideways purple resistance line too. This tells me we have more to go down. If you look at the next chart below you can see we had a similar movement on April 21st and similar sized candle red on that day. We could be seeing the next big move of the market over the next month or so if this resistance rejection holds true. \n\nLooking at the ES futures you see that we broke the blue dotted resistance line which would be bullish but we rejected the purple channel. You can see by the blue arrows that everytime we have hit these we have reversed course. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vn8d7kx60ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8da2c39629dce6d99bfccd78b654229ca5cd6583\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2chkbae70ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4f188db42685b93d2a5969f55409edca7fdc81b\n\nAnd then we have the vix… it attempted to break back into that key 25.5 level today and even saw 25.91 at its peak today but overall I would still venture to say that the VIX is not onboard yet for the next leg down. The only reason im not saying its time to go heavy into some puts here or uvxy/ VIX calls is because of how the VIX reacted today… I feel like it more naturally reacted today but it still didn’t quite spike and hold like we would have expected. I would and will be bearish longer term once we break through 26.7 VIX. \n\nI still think this could have easily been a market over reaction to the Apple news. If it was a over reaction then we will see a pop tomorrow and most likely see a green day tomorrow. Unless some more news about tech come out tomorrow there really isn’t anything until Tesla earnings Wednesday night that would really move the markets. I would be careful here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjbg4z380ec91.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4b31fa3f1c4cb7ce18bde07fec966420437a23c\n\nI also would be careful until this breaks back under 20k. Hoping that a picture of it wont result in my post getting removed… but I think this being so green today is a big hint of whats to come. I wont be full bear thill this breaks back under 20k and holds. \n\nBull case for SPY/ ES-\n\nDespite the big sell off today we managed to close at that key 382 support. It is an adjusted close to just slightly under 382.23 which is the daily 8ema… Looking at Fridays candle we do see a possible double bottom forming here at 382 and the wicks at 380.6. The VIX has not fully committed to the next drop yet and until we really see that break and fly over 26.6 we most likely are going to hold what we got. We do have to keep in mind that today could have been a true market over reaction which we have seen time and time before. It could be argued that this new was used as a chance to fill the big gap up we had overnight and that now that the gap is filled we should reverse. \n\nBear case for SPY/ ES- Markets have been looking for a reason to dump and this might finally be the reason. With a resistance line rejection of two key channels this morning with a failure to break through that is bearish. This morning even before the apple new markets had SPY pinned within a &lt;$2 range for almost the whole day till the sell off started. After blowing through key 385 support and now closing under the daily 8ema and 382 support it is only natural that we could see 378.8 to fill the gap below us. We also have a fully engulfing bear candle on the daily now\n\nDaily support for SPY- 382 -&gt; 378.8 -&gt; 375.1 -&gt; 370.6\n\nDaily support for ES- 3795 -&gt; 3744 -&gt; 3671\n\nDaily resistance for SPY- 385 -&gt; 387.3 -&gt; 390.3\n\nDaily resistance for ES- 3915 -&gt; 4020\n\nI feel bearish long term still but short term im not ready to be bearish enough to hold anything. I would have like it better had we stopped at 385 and formed a doji at the top on all the dailys to help with a clear reversal. This fat massive candle is not quite the reversal candle we would expect. The case for both channel resistance rejection is quite strong but we haven’t had back to back trend days in a very long time and all last week no matter what happened buyers ate everything up and we even saw that today. \n\nOverall I see two scenarios\n\n1) We will hold support here at 382 and back test resistance at 385. A rejection at 385 would be a more compelling top/ reversal case than we have here. I also wouldn’t be surprised to see the 388.5 resistance retested tomorrow either. If we see that then we can get not only a TRUE double top on the daily but we can also get a true tan channel resistance rejection. That would be a case for me to feel and stay feeling bearish. \n\n2) If we are seeing the next leg down it will start with filling the gap at 378.8. This is going to be key with what happens next. Most times a gap fills we do see a reversal so that is something we would need to keep in mind. However, if the VIX finally gets on board or we get anymore big tech bad news we might see this sell off continue. I would need VIX &gt;26.6 to believe in it though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rih5eov90ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947ffa2808f2d51357fea2154c30e4b50847a921\n\nAMD actually looks fairly bearish here on the daily with this hanging man doji. This is the type of candle I wanted to see on ES or SPY today to really sell the top but we didn’t get it. AMD did fill their daily gap though so I would be surprised if we see a back test of support at 79.5. If that 79.5 support holds there is a pretty big case to be made for 87.2 still especially with the CHIP bill being voted on tomorrow. However, if 79.5 fails we just might see a back test of that 71.6 support. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a GREAT day that I turned into a GOOD day thanks to greed and also playing it safe. All morning I hated the trend and I recognized the range super early which was great. The news broke out and I was able to get some nice plays in. I was not expecting this level of dump today and was definitely expecting this to be an over-reaction and recovery intraday especially since VIX wasn’t on board. Made some great gains and then at 2pm I made my error but going in on another 0dte OTM 381p. They burnt me with the choppiness and I finally decided to close for -41.7% after it bounced and bounce and bounced around. Little did I know had I just held on a little longer… it woulda been a 6x position by EOD. \n\nDays like today are the hardest because its the time of day that if you just hold on long enough everything will be green. But days like today make the next day even harder. Because then we have this false safe feeling that “well if I just hold them imma get green.” And then we just keep holding and averaging down and it just keeps getting redder and redder until we realize we are too burn to even salvage anything. In this market we have to salvage our losses and mitigate our risk/ loss. \n\nTodays biggest lesson was 0dtes are still a great trade but EOD OTM 0dte are a big struggle. Had I just gone ATM like I usually do I wouldn’t have gotten burnt like that and felt the need to sell. I will not be playing these OTM again until days like FOMC when we fully expect the big move before it happens. \n\nAlso had I just sat with my $1200 profits I would have been very happy but instead I ended up with just over $600 in profits. Tough day to trade today for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1kssaara0ec91.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf024f4b26c14ec236e5216c24063d10cbe20490', 'label': 1}, {'text': '7-18-22 Spy/ ES Futures and AMD Daily TASo let me get this straight… we had nothing but terrible news all week last week but ole Apple drops a news nugget about hiring slowing and market capitulates itself?

Wow what an unbelievable day to actual watch.\n\nLet me get this straight… Yesterday 389 was like some massive wall of resistance that was nearly impossible to break through and then we proceeded to have a $8+ sell off (some will argue fueled by apple news) but now all of a sudden… we are back to bull town and just have a massive $10.32 green day? Am I understanding that correctly? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x108a69bdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=175faa3511afd8efed68c3ccd2e3ed85f1147a7f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qnecirqbdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04407cf0e0b47547701c892723115baf3b4c2d6a\n\nThe daily turned out to be hella bullish and despite a VERY good chance to close under that KEY 390.2 resistance it decided to push higher EOD and hold for a bullish close. \n\nCouple big things to note here…. \n\n1. We broke through the tan downward channel resistance this resistance dates all the way back to April…. That’s a huge break \n\n2. We broke through and CLOSED a candle over the 390.2 purple sideways channel resistance for the first time since June 10th.\n\n3. We also closed a FULL candle over the daily 8 and 20ema for the first time since June 6th. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39bye3bcdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e39a8fe36ee8528735e0cb3339d8faf466adec18\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8esll45ddlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd51fd30d8dec6191b00ba9c799c69a5f2a614c7\n\nSo here is our updated Daily chart… what do you see? \n\nI see a MASSIVE symmetrical triangle breakout/ break down pattern forming… we just bounced off support when we hit 371 and now it looks like we will go test resistance which will be near 402 with this current trajectory. Why is 402 significant? Well there is a massive gap left on the daily that dates back to June from 395.78 to 401.44. \n\nLets take a look at the weekly now…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlkxscxddlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f4a83aa5cb7a62762e32adf7c58ac98b1101cf2\n\nI mentioned earlier in the week the descending triangle was broken but we do have a new one we are working on right now. The interesting thing about the weekly is that this is the first time since June 6th that we have seen SPY trend over the weekly 8ema. We have cleared a crucial resistance of 389 on the weekly chat and I will be looking for 397 this week and 410-415 next week if this momentum keeps up. \n\nKey support for bulls tomorrow is now that 388.9 and 390.2 level. If it happens to get back tested it will be crucial that they hold it. But solidifying that support would lead to more bullish upside. However, the current support line shows that we will hold above 390.5. Bulls will be targeting 397.4 minimum tomorrow and closer to 401.6 for a true gap fill. It has been Since May 26th and May 27th that we have gotten back to back 2%+ green days. I am curious to see if we get that type of pop again tomorrow. \n\nBears are going to look to break down that 390.5 support line that’s we have been trending on since the 371 support test. If they break that down they will want to see 382 support broken. \n\nLooking at this daily chart I was correct yesterday when I said I didn’t feel like that red candle was a true reversal candle… granted I didn’t feel like we would hit that sort of green today and I really didn’t think we would break 390.2. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgi1kajedlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4da02a1f210232cac49d78eecfdbfdb8c0da40c1\n\nFutures is looking fairly similar to SPY.. it broke its sideways purple channel and yesterday it broke the same resistance line that SPY broke intraday today… chart wise it does appear ES is proceeding what SPY is going to do. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0v219s5hdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ae7d4e02e1c0b87ea617d90b3d3f81352a8082b\n\nFutures with a pretty clear trend also just like SPY. Symmetrical breakout triangle with support hit just on July 14th at 3724. Es closed a candle over 3920 for the first time since June 9th which is very bullish. I am also seeing that intraday today ES tested its daily 50ema for the first time since June 3rd. I will be watching Futures closely over night to see how it interacts with 3950. \n\nBull levels to watch- 3950 à 4000 à 4090.\n\nCurrent bull channel resistance for a break out is at 4010.\n\nBear levels to watch – 3920 à 3875 (support line for this bull run) à 3827. \n\nIf bulls can keep this momentum up and they can close this over the daily 50ema tomorrow of 3850 that is going to lead to some extremely bullish momentum for the end of the week and next week. However, if bears finally step back in tomorrow and reject the 50ema we might see a larger break down and back test that 3875 support which is that fails I believe we are on the path back to 3827. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f2b771fidlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ff58fd7fb3ca932f61ff8633d083d7574194d5\n\nThe ES futures weekly I am very curious where we are going to go here… We still have a descending wedge we are watching and looking to see that broken at the 3970 level. We are also seeing us trade over the weekly 8ema for the first time since early June. Overall you can see we have 3 major levels on ES futures right now. The bottom level is 3675, the middle level is 3905 and the upper level (our current upside target) is 4160. \n\nRight now we have clearly bounced off the bottom 3675 level and after what looks like 4 weeks of consolidation bouncing off this 3905 level… we look ready to breakout to the upside. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7nb6a40jdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a66c1a6725df17f520a3bd9c46f78124b17d2c9d\n\nAnd then we have the VIX… this thing I just can not figure out. SPY just put in nearly a 3% green day and it acted like we just chopped at 0% all day long. The VIX essentially reacted the exact same to a -2% drop as it did a 2%+ rip. What does that mean exactly? Well I am still unsure on this to be honest. On one hand I feel the market is pretty numb to all news and I have mentioned a few times now that the 200weekly ema bounce at 363 COULD have been bottom and the vix is going to slowly unwind down. On the otherhand I feel like we are getting such wild volumes right now (watching VOLD and VOLSPD intraday) that its just trumping anything the VIX wants to do. Bullish? Or bearish? Im still unsure as next week is still going to be a hell of a big potential shit storm with I believe its 70% of SPYs earnings reporting this or next week, FOMC, and GDP…\n\n10% Challenge-\n\nToday was a tough day for me. I had a massive struggle believing in this bull day and believing we would see this strong of a bull day. For the last pretty much month we have been living in chop land. And I have relied heavily on the improbable/ probable highs and lows of the day based on IV (this is a think or swim indicator you can add to your chart). For about the last month (really until this last week) we have seen the Probable lows/ highs act as walls and they have been great levels to scalp reversals and to scalp momentum from and to. Today we hit 388 which was the probable IV low of the day and that was also resistance from yesterday. We chopped at 389.7 resistance for almost 2 hours before we finally pushed higher and we broke the improbable high of day of 391.4 around 145pm. From there we just kept rejecting and retesting this support level. I was able to get in two nice scalps here a call and a put at this level. Power hour I decided I was going to play the reversal off of 392.7 and I was expecting us being nearly $1.5 over the improbable high that we would see a reversal and a dump EOD. Of course that is not what happened. Took a hard loss on that scalp there but I still got 3 days to turn this week around to green. \n\nMy current struggle is that for the last month… really the last 6 months now… we have experience this WILD reversal swings and WILD 1-2% dumps. As much as I would LOVE spy to return to a consistent market and trend I am very hesitant to expect such things from it. With the VIX seemingly plateaued at this 24-25 level the last few days everything has been volume driven. Watching VOLD and VOLSPD end of day today despite them running non stop bull all day today they really broke out EOD and drove SPY even higher. \n\nPerhaps we are getting back to a market where we can trust the trend and actually rely on the 8ema for support and resistance. Perhaps we… for now… are past these massive reversal and massive swings. I will be watching intraday tomorrow to see if we are getting back to levels where we can trust a play to run for the day instead of closing it with a quick scalp. But my lesson the last two or three days has been to trust the volume not the VIX. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bffoxnqjdlc91.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821bec54bd51bec763654a4b8fc87048319cd881\n\nI played a OTM Netflix (very small lotto) play today I was tempted to and should have closed it EOD but didn’t. Being that Netflix is up 7.5% right now im pretty sure she gonna be nothing at open. The guidance call on Netflix will be very interesting. But the expected move at 14%+ for Netflix today so either way unless we massively dump this was a losing trade. My one and only earnings play. \n\nAfter seeing all the bullish momentum the last two days and really the last week and the 390/ 3920 levels being broken and closed over I decided to play this call overnight. I have a feeling with Netflix beating (not that I really think they could have taken the markets down) and now with tesla tomorrow night we will get one more bull day. \n\nI honestly think a 401.5 gap fill is possible tomorrow… it would be a 2.4% green day for SPY. I would not be surprised to see a gap up tomorrow either and a 1%+ green open for SPY. \n\nWe left the 379.05 to 380.54 and 369.38 to 370.18 gaps down below. My thoughts are we are finally going to fill this 401.5 gap and then we can position ourselves bearishly for the next week. It’s the perfect storm… bull week leading into the black swan week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/giq4xv8kdlc91.png?width=503&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e22723f16066256d94c7eb6819de2e257234ff8', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'NVDA[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': '$ SPY ↘️ ⚠️ Atentos', 'label': 1}, {'text': "Anyone following Nancy Pelosi's husband on NVDA?Up almost $9 dollars today with AH up another $2.

Come to think of it, I know for a fact some of you out there have heard of Rivian, Nio, and Lucid (you know who you are, I’ve seen your loss porn). Every single one of these car makers (and many, many more) are pressing the “brrrrrrr” button on electric vehicles. Even the once gas-guzzling, still dick-inflating Hummer is now all electric.

LITHIUM.\n\nFor those of you with less than a 3rd grade reading level, let me paint a picture for you through a few pictures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEV sales are expected to nearly 6X from now to 2030 in just the US alone:\n\n[See how the chart goes up? That means we need more batteries. Just in case, let’s go over this again. What do batteries need? LITHIUM.](https://preview.redd.it/vvteve6mesd91.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf071f095201fe135688d8e86ce64d8995deb561)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere’s a projection of how much lithium we need to meet the EV demand:\n\n[Notice how this chart also goes up?

Now it’s hitting home, right? Lithium prices are up 10X since the start of 2021 and 5X since last summer \\(important to note for below\\). Side note: this chart is in CNY \\(Chinese Yuan\\) because China currently dominates the world’s lithium market, but that’s a conversation for another time. Long story short, the world doesn't want China controlling global lithium supplies.](https://preview.redd.it/e41lshctesd91.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7684f6c589979e73e450687deac4d71665a9d50)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that we've had some pictures for you to look at, hopefully that convinced you to buckle up and choke down that third Adderall pill so you can focus for the next five god-damn minutes and read the rest of this so you can pass out and yarf on your own carpet one day. Take that Dad.\n\nThere’s a couple last important things to note with the charts above.\n\n1.)  Producing more lithium can’t be done with the flip of a switch. Most new facilities take a minimum of 5-7 years to be planned, approved, and start producing. Back in May, some window-licker over at Goldman Sachs wrote that he thinks the lithium market has peaked until 2025 ( [https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf) ).\n\nHere’s what just a few others had to say about that report:\n\n\\- [https://www.mining.com/benchmark-heres-what-goldman-got-wrong-about-lithium-prices/](https://www.mining.com/benchmark-heres-what-goldman-got-wrong-about-lithium-prices/)\n\n\\- [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/3-Reasons-Goldman-Sachs-Is-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/3-Reasons-Goldman-Sachs-Is-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)\n\n\\- [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/goldman-lithium-price-forecast-sparks-backlash-in-the-metals-world#xj4y7vzkg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/goldman-lithium-price-forecast-sparks-backlash-in-the-metals-world#xj4y7vzkg)\n\n\\- [https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/](https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I mean Goldman’s is never wrong, right? They couldn’t possibly be releasing a report like this to sink the lithium market so they can buy more for less, right?? I mean if they thought the lithium market was going to tank for the next few years because of over-supply, they would never BUY MORE Lithium stocks right???\n\nYep, you guessed it. Straight from their most recent 13F-HR filing:\n\n[This is their Q1 filing… I wonder what their Q2 will have to say when released…](https://preview.redd.it/zwpox5ayesd91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3365cae45ac8e4ac20dab84cf2eb781d80de6c5)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, while typically I try not to condone this kind of behavior, I would like to give a special shout out to Mr. Window Licker himself to thank him for giving us the buying opportunity of a lifetime on many of these lithium stocks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.)  Lithium producers typically sign contracts to sell their product for a set amount of time (commonly one year) for a set price throughout the contract. So, going back to that handy-dandy lithium spot pricing chart, I want you to take a gander at about when that pretty little line went parabolic (hint: I fucking marked it). For those of you who are too lazy to scroll up or if you’re just unsure and want to double check your work: August 2nd, 2021. Hmm, that's about a year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do we do with this information? We buy companies that produce lithium of course and we bet an unreasonable amount of our portfolio on it to boot. Now to the part all you shit-flingers will probably skip down to: “Just tell me what to buy already!” Here’s a brief summary on my lithium plays and my positions.\n\n   \n \n\n\\- Albemarle ($ALB) – 50 Shares, two 8/19 $250C, one 8/19 $260C\n\no Earnings Call: 8/3 After Hours\n\no One of the world’s current largest lithium producers than has multiple lithium mines in production and several others projects on the way. They absolutely destroyed their Q1 earnings report and should crush it once again for the next 3-4 quarters at a minimum as profits from those beautiful new lithium contracts from last year start to roll in. They are also diversified (hard word, I know) and are involved in several other market segments, but make no mistake this is still a lithium play at the end of the day. Additionally, they are US based so they’re going to get some of that sweet sweet low-interest government money courtesy of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM).\n\n\\- Lithium Americas – 920 Shares, fifteen 8/19 $30C, nine 11/18 $30C\n\no Earnings Call: 8/4 Pre Market\n\no Massive upside on this company as probably the most intriguing junior lithium miner right now. Sure, they haven’t made any profit yet, but that’s a pretty fucking big “yet”. They are currently in the final stages of approvals for the largest lithium mine in North America at Thacker Pass in Nevada. Once this makes it through a final court case appeal this September it will be all system go on this project and I would bet my left nut that that will be the case here. I won’t get too far into this since I have written about it before, but there are several other catalysts on the horizon and revenues are coming very very soon. My PT on this one is $150/share by the end of 2025.  Massive upside here, don’t miss the boat. I’ll likely be turning some of my earnings play profits into many more 11/18 &amp; 2/17 calls.\n\n\\- Livent ($LTHM) – 300 Shares, two 8/19 $25c, thirty 8/19 $30C, five 8/19 $40C\n\no Earnings Call: 8/2 After Hours\n\no Another US based company with projects that are already producing. Major earnings beat in their last call and I fully expect them to blow it out of the water once again and for the next several quarters. They are heavily focused on being as green and sustainable as possible, which is an important factor in this field. I think we could see $40/share by early next year.\n\n\\- Sociedad Quimica y Minera ($SQM) – 50 Shares (No options…yet)\n\no Earnings Call: 8/17 After Hours\n\no More similar to Albemarle since they are well-diversified, but at the end of the day their lithium production is one of their biggest revenue drivers. I’ll probably write an article on them prior to their earnings so, I’ll just say I have option plays to come on this one as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Do you know someone who drives a car?

I don’t know if its cause of the bigger run up we had intraday before FOMC or what the reason was. But I expected at least a 0.5 to 1% drop with 392 being my target. We never even dropped 0.3% below $395 before she rocketed… candles double bottomed off 395.47 and then it was gone from there. \n\nMy plan was to execute a trade at 235pm and get into it. I missed my entry and watched my premium rocket. I was not going to chase it so I sat this one out. Thankfully a lot of people in the server really profited today off this trade and this entry time. I guess I was still in vacation mode and missed my opportunity. With the capital I planned to risk… it had to be perfect for me to want to enter it and it just wasn’t 100% what I expected or wanted so I sat it out. It was not very fun watch it go by and sleeping on the entry though. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zf1pqcgfg6e91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc6d5e5520490af6bf3d487f35035c0d227fb646\n\nThis FOMC had a few interesting things about it though… \n\nFirst off it was the first FOMC that we didn’t have a red week leading up to it. As you can see below the average drop this year for FOMC (not including January) was 1.2% and we barely dropped 0.3%. The new average is 0.98% drop… we dropped about 25% of what was expected. We also only rallied 1.9% from 230pm to EOD high. This was about 67% of the expected rally and about 73% of the new average rally. The other weird thing was the volume the Average volume for the FOMCs this year (including January) is 141mil for the day we barely broke 80 mil today. \n\n*Processing img o689d80gg6e91...*\n\nSo where are we? Okay a couple things we need to keep in mind from this meeting and for tomorrow… we now have 8 weeks till the next FOMC meeting. JPOW did say we are not CURRENTLY in a recession, however, we haven’t had the 2nd gdp number for him to say we are… they for the first time ever said “we are taking this meeting to meeting” and he said that we are still expecting some aggressive rate hikes in the future. The fed for the first time that I have heard said they are downgrading the economy… they are working off high job growth and low unemployment (when this changes we should be concerned). JPOW did confirm inflation is too high still (duh). Fed is no longer going to provide clear guidance for the future and future hikes like they have in the past. JPOW said the path to a soft landing is quickly narrowing and getting further and further away. No decision or timeline to end rate hikes or slow them. \n\nThe weirdest thing he said was “the first GDP reading is usually heavily revised…” I think this is going to come back around. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k0ttg6mgg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d320d5c7a0aac4928f92f9d7c16106c86cffab8b\n\nTomorrow we get an interesting amount of economic data with that very important GDP. Forecast is 0.3% and we are expecting per the Atlanta feds GDP now forecast -1.2% as of yesterday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vlbxoc6hg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea4cf8cf6ac318f74e3e2899aca0f8e9215d178a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u5q5c2phg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25e7d2b4bc7255e925df291a3b37bc24d9fb01ec\n\nSO as you can see on the SPY daily we had a pretty major break through of 3 different daily resistance lines today. We also closed over the JPM morgan collars top. The last time we were at the JPM morgan collar we rejected it. This will be interesting to watch play out. The current trajectory we are on could have us resting the orange channel resistance of 411 by August 5th. If we break through that we are actually looking at a possibility of testing the overall bear market channel resistance of 433 by August 18th. If we were to break that green channel resistance at the top this month… it would confirm bear market is 100% over. That would make a higher high for the first time since January. \n\nWe FINALLY gap filled 401.44 today after trying for the last 1.5 months to fill it. \n\nWe are at a pretty important time here on SPY… I fully expect a red open tomorrow due to GDP and due to post FOMCs almost always being red. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w8tdvq8ig6e91.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1662d7d80e07ab97a889e40905aaffcf32096d2b\n\nThe last two FOMC days we have see -3%+ red days and had red opens. With GDP tomorrow it’s the perfect storm for a nice red day to not only play puts overnight but to find a call loading opportunity. \n\nOverall I am going to be looking for a call buying opportunity around 394.5 (-1.7%) support test tomorrow. If we break through that support this breaks the upwards trajectory and we could be looking for a restest of 390.9 (-2.6%) support test. I suspect this 390.9 support to hold but if that fails then we start thinking about the 378 gap. Market is in such perma bull mode right now its hard to believe we break back down to 378 gap fill right now. \n\nBulls are going to look to break through and close over 401.5 resistance and will now be targeting close over the daily 100ema of 407 (1.5%) tomorrow. From there we just slowly start picking away and resistance line after resistance line. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7amsdqig6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de67c99e6ace034fd5ef69a9a35a6f36e7f72f93\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppuzwcdjg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ec19247eb151b27b925030e64e797e734e6607a\n\nFutures painting a fairly similar picture… broke some impressive resistance lines today and held support line nicely this morning/ overnight. Overall I will be watching futures more closely as it has been the guide to where we are going next. \n\nFutures bulls are going to target holding support of 4003 (-0.5%) and then 3960 (-1.5%) tomorrow. Holding 3960 is crucial for bulls tomorrow. Bulls will be looking to break above the daily 100ema at 4080 (1.5%). From there bulls are targeting that orange channel resistance at 4123 (2.6%)  by August 5th. The biggest fight and resistance will take place at 4180 (3.9%) if bulls make it there. \n\nBears goal tomorrow is to break through that 3960 support line. From there we start back testing supports at 3920 (-2.5%). 3920 is a major support that bulls can not give up. From there we starts looking at further supports such as 3828 (-4.8%) and 3785 (-6%).\n\nAm I bullish or am I bearish? Well this ones a tough one. FOMC is the wildcard that moves markets more then it should. I don’t believe a 2.6% green day was very warranted today personally. So my expectation is that we do see a pretty large retrace tomorrow. Also statistically/ historical data speaking we should see a red day (most likely very large) after a FOMC meeting. With GDPs potential 2nd reading coming out tomorrow I suspect that markets are going to be down pre market and at 830 when that news drops (especially with a spike in jobless claims) we will see a very red day. The risk to reward of puts overnight is very high in my opinion and well worth the position. \n\nNow if tomorrow opens green and we hold green/ close green tomorrow im going to be going full bull here until the market says otherwise. Pretty much the last two weeks now dips have been buying opportunities. GDP is pretty much bears last chance tomorrow to scare the market into a dump. It will be interesting to see what happens. It also worries me how the two trading days before today were both the lowest volume of the year and today was the lowest volume FOMC day this year (about 60% of normal average fomc volume). \n\nThere is an argument that markets are waiting for GDP tomorrow before they full send it bullishly. Depending on how tomorrow plays out I will be looking at some 30dte calls for an expectation that we reach 430 by the end of August. If I don’t position long (safer not to) I will at least intraday be bullish and trust run ups more than I have before. \n\nOverall it’s a very weird market right now when you factor in volume and realistically all the terrible news and bearish catalysts we have… despite all that we are either truly having the worlds greatest bear market rally or we are seeing the bottom truly be in. Apple is about $1 (at close) from breaking through MAJOR resistance. If apple breaks through $157.66 tomorrow ($158 for confirmation) then apple has officially broke its overall 2022 bear channel… and it will be the return of the bull run. As crazy as it is to say… there is a case to be made that Apple retests its ATH by end of August…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcf0feskg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea33905045f8cca4f316e51c9a7166883edb537a\n\n10% challenge- \n\nDespite having the plan for pretty much a month now of how I was going to tackle FOMC day… I blew it 100%. I did not like when I saw that the markets did not dump at least 0.5%. I was intently watching at 235pm for what it was going to do and before I could enter the entry was gone. \n\nThe other thing I really didn’t like about today was the IV. The IV never really crushed till after 3pm. We have in the past seen a pretty good IV crush from 215 to 230pm but today we saw IV stay in the 80s the whole time. It made premiums very high and with the smaller then usually move the usually 300-500% gains were not there at all. If you timed the entry perfectly most were seeing 150-200% gains. \n\nI did a swing SPX over night to hold but took 10% and repositioned into a 4010p for tomorrow. I suspect this will pay out nicely tomorrow. If im wrong the risk to reward was good enough to warrant this play for me. Overall with no IV pump I need a 4005 open -0.4% open for breakeven. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdjsbbclg6e91.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1be80700fd2743f64d74598c5a7a7261acf2fbd', 'label': 1}, {'text': "puts on $META , $GOOGL (YouTube) &amp; £TikTokU.S. Senate panel approves update of children's online privacy bill\n\nWASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee voted Wednesday to approve a measure that would raise the age children are given special online privacy protections to 16 and bar targeted advertising to children by companies like TikTok and Snapchat without consent.\n\nThe bill, which was adopted by voice vote, will now go to the full Senate for consideration.

We had similar days yesterday and today was identical. Now lets take a look at the Daily chart and see some interesting correlations…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gt9ppd23jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27acf0fd4e865d23478b92dedbafa0bb7fc35cd0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xopj4hn3jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0216a7ee5afd3032b32f46697d4d34ee70b5b2cc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5urcbk74jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c2ef12809a7a07c19d2687ed75761a154692302\n\nOkay take a look back at march I have highlighted with a blue arrow and a “the day before march FOMC meeting.” If you look at it there is clearly a trend there where we bottomed the day before fomc and from there if you look at the candles they are nearly identical. So what does that mean? Well it means to me we are about to go on a even bigger bull run then we are currently on. Okay hear me out here for a second…\n\nIn March we had a meeting and then we had no more meetings until May… we are currently in July and have no meeting until September. We are looking at a nearly identical trajectory and base as then. If you remember back to march it was the simple buy calls on the morning dips and let it eat. This morning I was very tempted to get into some 30dte calls and the only reason I did not get into those calls were because I knew Apple earnings were tonight and PCE was tomorrow morning. \n\nWe are in a clear bull path towards 420-430. \n\nHere is a few other things to look at and think about. If you look at the purpleish blue trend line I highlighted the May 20th to June 2nd bear market rally. That rally was about 9.69% and lasted 8 days from low to peak. I superimposed that over to current July 14th bottom. Which shows that we are now tapped out on the bullrun is that’s the trajectory we are going off. Currently from the July 14th bottom we are up 9.6%. The argument could be made that we just made the top today and it is downward from here. \n\nNow if we are basing it off the day before FOMC meeting being the bottom like March then we look at the March 14th to March 29th 11 day rally of 11.1%. Which give us an 11 day trajectory (August 10th… the day of the next CPI meeting….) and a 11.1% rally which give us about 432.8 price target. \n\nNow this is where it gets crazy…. I calculated that trajectory strictly based off of the data not the chart. Now if you go to the chart and you look at August 10th AND look at the resistance line (the solid green line) it PERFECTLY correlated at…. 433.33… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tidgke35jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e442e5dc7c303b8f19e29dc7232fdb596c80c36\n\nSo am I bullish? Hell yeah. Apple looking great after its earnings… why does that matter? Well let me show you why…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxrfhjm5jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a5208488935ad14684486cd108fb5cb64f11458\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3d2qbg46jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7745111953aa891e93b5f13070a9115775ae881b\n\nHere is the Apple chart… what do you see? You can see we are in a CLEAR downward grey channel that we have been trading within for all of 2022. This channel uses the lows from January and May then projects that to the highest point of march. IF apple opens over 157.2 tomorrow morning (which with earnings it should) then we are about to see Apple confirm 100% that its bear market is over… This would be the first time in 2022 that Apple fails to make lower highs over and over. Yes we have not broke the actual March high but breaking this channel is essentially saying the 2022 Apple bear market is now over… With this move Apple is going to Guide SPY and the rest of the market higher and higher. \n\nApples next price target assuming it holds and breaks over 157.2 at open will be 163.9 -&gt; 174 -&gt; 180.\n\nThe one thing to be careful about with Apple is if it opens up with a massive gap tomorrow whether that fills or not. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tphgasq6jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c2954f225490cd2f28c76eb06fc50da07312c49\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhlqwnk7jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842020edb718d2e0a009ad5209de891092ccd8dd\n\nHere is the SPY and ES weekly charts that show just how bullish we are… Tomororw bulls are going to look to close the week out over 4145/ 413. Breaking those weekly downward channels opens us up to those green dotted resistance lines with a price target of 430/ 4335 by the week of CPI. \n\nIf you look at the green dotted resistance and blue dotted support lines they are actually forming a massive symmetrical triangle which should lead to a fairly significant breakout or break down. \n\nOverall with not really anything negative besides PCE tomorrow… which im only even mentioning this since JPOW was so clear in his “we look at PCE more then CPI” during his speech. But after tomorrow morning when market opens and we see it settle I will be entering some either 14dte calls. I will be looking at some 14dte 414C according to optionstrat that will be about the best risk to reward for my price target of 433 and time frame. \n\nLooking at after hours right now we are up about 0.83% which will leave another nearly $3 gap on the daily down below. This would be the third on the daily chart to the downside now… does that confirm we see more downside in the future? Yes I think it does… one small gap I can justify leaving but I cant really justify leaving three pretty decently sized gaps on the daily chart. \n\nMost likely scenario is we get somewhere near that 433 price target before we reject and see further downside. 410-415 will be a crucial resistance to watch on the way up. \n\nLately it appears at least for the last two weeks that we get a fake breakout in the morning followed by a sell off and then around 10 to 11 we finally find bottom and that is the optimal buy and hold call opportunity. I will be looking for this to play out tomorrow as I do suspect we could back fill the gap down to 406.8 in the morning at open before we push higher. \n\nIt wouldn’t be unheard of to see markets open and straight rally in a trend day now that all earnings are down, gdp is apparently old news already, no fed meetings for 8 weeks and no cpi for 3 weeks. There is literally nothing to worry about now…\n\nAll dips are now call buying opportunities…\n\n10% challenge-\n\nA pretty meh day for me today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12t0x5b8jde91.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23b4d6a992ad71fc3d6b2cfaa0e88047dcae5e93\n\nI held those SPX puts overnight expecting a pretty big dump on GDP. Thankfully was able to get out of them at the bottom this morning. Apple looked hella weak this morning and with the earnings I attempted to enter for a nice free IV pump but apparently I bought the bottom.   \n I had the perfect SPX scalp around noon when there was a big dump in volume. Was up 10% instantly. Had a stop limit order in and it didn’t fill on the way down. Never saw green again. 404 was the probable high of day and it was not quite convincing at the time we would go much higher. At least we did though and I finally took my loss. Play a SPY 1dte call on the way up. \n\nSo far since I was on vacation earlier in the week and didn’t trade FOMC im sitting on a slightly red but manageable week right now. \n\nNot riding anything overnight. I was pretty close to entering those 14 or 30dte calls at market close but decided it was best to wait for apple and PCE just in case.', 'label': 1}, {'text': "true retardation at it's finest - bought on instinct when I should have sold CC's the plays are in the picture. purchased when everything was in the money / pre split no stops set.

So far August is showing a bit of a change of pace compared to July. Perhaps the tides are changing? \n\nToday was one hell of a choppy, indecisive and volatile day. I would call this a range day but its not the smooth normal range days we are used to. A lot of these candles were left with some massive wicks and filled with volatile reversals and indecisions. \n\nSo where are we at?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8d4jgh1fw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c31940de583b86eab40a4dd61f3fc9ebce86045\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6r958wfw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf72f69a27f2ebc505cf64c2b65aec1cb5c7b331\n\nLooking at the SPY/ ES daily charts we got a couple important things to note. \n\nOn SPY the daily candle did wick through the downward bear channel resistance, however, on ES we had a clear rejection of resistance. Channel resistance for ES remains at 4142 for tomorrow. \n\nDespite a weaker day and closing red the bulls were able to hold the 100ema and even avoided a true retest of that support. SPYs daily candle finished as a large bodied gravestone doji while you could consider ES futures daily either a dragonfly doji or a hanging man depending on how you analyze it. \n\nSPY daily candle is bearish while ES is neutral to bullish, however, with the ES channel resistance rejection I favor bearish there. \n\nAs you can see on SPY I have highlighted some horizontal levels that we have historically this year traded within. Currently we are visiting that 405.3 to 417.2 levels. If you look at May 27th to June 8th it appears we could be preparing to enter a similar level of consolidation. This consolidation could lead to the next leg down or up with 405 and 417 being those key levels to watch for direction. \n\nThe 417 level is going to be protected heavily by the daily 200ema and that will be quite the resistance for bulls to break and hold over, while by time we get to it the daily 8ema will be closer to that 405 level and also will add some downside support/ protection and the daily 100ema at 407.5 should provide some heavier support also. \n\nOverall daily chart wise I will be watching for range/ consolidation and prepared to play the level to level chop like I did today. Until we see the daily 100ema or daily 200ema break I am not apt to chose an overall direction. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/twterangw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9786a3823c46ab0759908677e68f0a09ede7016\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pgdenighw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e27e2430efb5a070061104a2947db0521933145a\n\nSPY/ ES weekly you can see we did break out of the bear channel, however, historically about the time w break the channel is about the time we are seeing the top and start our week of consolidation. So that is something to bear in mind. Overall the SPY 415 and ES 4160 levels are going to be very key resistance levels to watch this week. If we see a pretty clean rejection there going into next week (much like the week of May 31st and June 6th) I will be apt to play some downside going into next week. \n\nBulls need to defend the now 8 week long bull channel support at SPY 400 and ES 4018. Overall this support is also the weekly 8emas for both. An intraweek support bounce here and pushing further up before end of the week would be bullish going into next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1x97im2iw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23aca5365443d9fac728e1f719253ec938d65206\n\nOverall Apple is the most bearish of them all and as I alerted today at the 163.59 HOD rejection that Apple is the best put play between SPY and Apple. That rejection today locked in my opinion an extremely bearish week ahead for Apple. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/93yf23niw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b006f87c503fad3a288e27ffe30ead4b52d775\n\nTodays daily candle is a double top and it is also a large gravestone doji. This candle should be the reversal/ downside indication many need to go long on some puts for the gap fill. As I mentioned last week apple had one of the largest gaps in many years left of the daily. I was also mentioning the weekly and how it was looking for a weekly channel rejection… well today we got that confirmed rejection. \n\nI will be looking for apple to back test support and gap fill this week. \n\nKey supports will be the weekly bull channel support/ daily 8ema at 157. And the gap just so happens to be at 157.64… almost too perfect of a bounce area. Level and daily channel support comes in around that 157 level also. I would be surprised to not see some 8/5 or 8/12 ATM puts print nicely on this gap fill. \n\nOnce the apple gap fills I do suspect there to be a nice bounce unless it flies through 157 and see 155 level. A break of the 155 level would be a bear omen and could lead to the next market sell off.\n\nIn my opinion this whole year apple has led and predicted the direction of where SPY and the markets were going. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10% challenge-\n\nI had an extremely frustrating week last week and spent a lot of the weekend reflecting and back testing a few different strategies to improve my trading. This week I decided to make a few adjustments to my trading and indicators and here they are.\n\n\\- i am now watching the 1min/ 5min chart with heikin ashi candles with a 20/ 50 ema following it. Intraday today the 1min HA candles with the 20/50ema was the best and most responsive. The 5min with the 20/50ema was great but a very lagging indicator. \n\n\\- i am no longer tracking the VIX live for entries. I used to heavily track the VIX and momentum there to confirm the direction of SPY. With the low VIX and overall detachedness of VIX/ SPY I no longer feel the need to do so. \n\n\\-I have no added my daily and weekly levels to my 15min chart I watch all day (level highlighted with purple and red thick lines). I think often times I was getting too lost in the noise of the the 15min candles, especially on days like today, and mixing the bigger picture level to level moves. Overall this was highly successful. \n\n\\-focusing on limiting entries for better profits on less entries. Less is more. \n\n\\-cutting all losers hard stop at 20%. No more letting losers become massive losers. \n\n\\-Relying on the probable and improbable IV levels as a better guide of when to and note to enter. The higher and closer to the improbable HOD the less likely hood I am to enter unless we have hella strong momentum and volume. \n\nOverall today was a great day… had one L on a bad fake out reversal that had I held woulda been very profitable but I was happy to cut the L and still turn in a profit for the day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8v2j6pujw5f91.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7042a625f4e04a5353558bfe7d06c3984dd855\n\nBiggest lesson of the day? Sometimes its better to just stop after 1 or 2 trades… had I just stopped after my first two trades and I even had talked about it in my server I would have finished with about 3x the profits I finished with today. \n\nEvery position we should be weighing risk to reward but we can not be scared to enter just to protect or win rate either.

They are buying revenue at steep prices, and user base is still leaving.This week has been good for many of our tech stocks. Meta went up 5% today together with the rest of the market and I believe this was a good buying opportunity for a put option.\n\nI think Meta is still on a downward spiral, and it's not the bottom yet. These are my thoughts only, and not extensive DD...not much science, lots of intuition and anecdotal perspectives. I wanted to post here for you to challenge and see what others might think.\n\nMeta's main business is advertisement - and these ads are not selling nearly as well as they used to. With Apple's significant changes to iOS and Safari, this cripples advertisers ability to target users as well as before. This is resulting in fewer ads being sold as advertisers are moving to other channels and overall putting less value into FB/IG ads.Some anecdotal evidence that might be the tip of the iceberg for Meta ads business continuing to decline. Amex just put up an offer for advertisers to spend $350 and get $150 back. That's over 40% off! Almost always, these offers are funded by the actual company, not Amex - and Amex in fact sometimes charge the company to show these offers to their members. So we're likely looking at a \\~10% fee that brings up the total cost to \\~50% to Meta.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1vyc4v7cakf91.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3054a67a2c9f9f69e113a940b17904a781a9f49f\n\nSo if Meta is trying to buy revenue at 50% margin, that's pretty bad.Meta doesn't have that great margin already, and has been on a serious decline, down below 25% in the latest quarter. A year ago, it was 35% - that's a 28% drop in one year. And their debt is climbing every quarter as they continue to invest in metaverse (whatever that is) - with no realistic path to sustainable profitability in that new space (pun intended).\n\nReminder that the past quarters have been pretty grim too:\n\n* Meta posts first-ever revenue drop as inflation throttles ad sales: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-parent-meta-forecasts-revenue-below-estimates-2022-07-27/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-parent-meta-forecasts-revenue-below-estimates-2022-07-27/)\n* Facebook records a drop in daily users - A first for it: [https://www.techradar.com/news/facebook-records-a-drop-in-daily-users-a-first-for-it](https://www.techradar.com/news/facebook-records-a-drop-in-daily-users-a-first-for-it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kr3e0z5gakf91.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6513bfd48d9294e2973f030f408d15b69502205\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/impsh4jhakf91.png?width=1430&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cd6fe4650f19daff8382df2cfefb74ea3c8b625\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOculus VR is not going anywhere.

IG is still holding strong but I can see this declining as more and more influencers (and users) use TikTok instead of IG. IG is trying desperately to copy TikTok features, and it really only causes two things:\n\n1. Validate user wants that TikTok is the preferred platform, train users to get used to the TikTok UI (migratory: shifts user / market share to TikTok)\n2. Alienate users who DO NOT like the TikTok UI and they spend less overall time on social media (destructive: reduces the overall social media pie, and share for FB/IG)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProof of position here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vq65vlbdakf91.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b071eac197952a4663dd31e91d482886b03fda42", 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Amd to the moon[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': "AMD vs REVWhat do you apes think the right move is?

The bulls were out in full force today or should I say… the bears didn’t wanna sell today. \n\nThis is now the 5th day in a row where we have opened ran up… dumped (and a very convincing dump may I add) only for us to then run even harder EOD. \n\nThe craziest thing of the whole day is Apple… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifthv1ij8kf91.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cf6e847ff50c2468be530ad00eb8e4a64f96d9d\n\nApple had an implied move of $2.01 with a improbable high of 162.84… for those of you who don’t know IV prices in movement everyday and overall it provides probable and improbable ranges… generally speaking even touching the improbable high is RARE let alone going over it…\n\nSo today we saw apple have a total DTR (daily true range) of 5.84 which is 290% of the implied IV move. It was also 144% of the average 10day range and 134% of the 30day average range. It reached nearly $4 over its improbable high of day. This is one of the most imbalanced and “unexpected” moves I have ever seen on apple. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vy6xbs3k8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9992b6c6a9028c8553f9205388de4e07d540a8b7\n\nThis was the greenest close apple has had since May 27th. As you can see looking very interesting on the daily… \n\nWe have officially broke out of the red rising wedge. We are now working on another black dotted rising wedge. This one uses early June dates for the resistance line. Today Apple perfectly hit that. It uses the last 7 trading days support for the support line. \n\nThis pattern gives a high of 167.6 and a low of 162.9. We still have that gap down below also on Apple but we are obviously getting further and further away form that gap. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tus6p2pk8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=200c1bda0bb87c211cf2e9ecec02b9dc8d81e5e5\n\nApple weekly chart broke its resistance line today too for the overall down trend and now all that is left is the resistance of the overall market which uses January 3rd and March 28th weekly highs as resistance. That gives us a possible upside of 174.5 next week. \n\nOverall if this extreme bullish momentum keeps up there is a case to be made for apple 175 next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/euqavk8l8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a06be3d1bd7d4916f02809ca8329af7ad4a5d18\n\nOverall SPY and Futures are putting in some crazy looking rising wedges… some of the tallest and most extreme rising wedges I have seen in a while on the daily. \n\nCurrently you can see on SPY we have the purple dotted resistance line which we rejected perfectly today. It uses the July 29th and June 28th daily candles for resistance. Resistance for tomorrow will be at 416.7\n\nThe black dotted resistance line uses July 29th, July 8th, July 7th and June 29th for resistance. This give sus a resistance of 418.8 tomorrow. \n\nAnd then we have the red dotted resistance line from June 28th, June 15th and June 13th which gives us resistance of 423.5 for tomorrow. \n\nWe have three potential rising wedges on the daily right now which is the most I have ever seen and they all give us potential to reject a resistance tomorrow. \n\nThe black dotted support line using August 3rd, Aug 2nd, July 27th and July 26th we have 413.8 as support tomorrow. \n\nWe broke the possible down trend resistance today too. \n\nWe are also about to hit the 417.4 level support which is also the daily 200ema. \n\nOverall despite pretty much every sign pointing to a sell off today AND that morning dump looking hella convincing the bears continue to be in control. There is no reason to short this until we break the 100ema. But I still hesitate to go long until we see the daily 200ema confirmed broken.\n\nIf we break that 200ema there is a decent chance we reach out for 430 next week. A good CPI could fuel an even higher bull run too. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv324lxl8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863757c0e7963f322dc6c7a70d5bb2ceb9001593\n\nFutures major resistances are the blacked dotted rising wedge at 4178, red dotted resistance at 4202 and the blue bull channel at 4241.\n\nThe 4178 level is both the daily 200ema and it is the resistance from June highs. \n\nThe biggest supports to watch for ES is 4117 and 4079 tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z44f7ggm8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2020a20b334ba1b0e2d880768f85da8ff568465a\n\nSpy on the weekly timeframe did attempt to break into the next weekly level at 415 today, however, end of day it lost that level. This has been a level that has been struggled to be breached and closed over since April. This will be a key level to watch the bulls and bears fight over. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rl0qkm1n8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9034aa07d93719cc3fcf8925c7ae0e20c227d37\n\nFutures also rejecting this level of 4160 too. This level for futures too has been pretty major resistance since April. \n\nThe bears will need to defend these 415/ 4160 level aggressively tomorrow if they have any hopes for the EOW and next week. Overall this is setting up for a break out to that 430/ 4360 levels unless we see a major sell off tomorrow and Friday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8a504xon8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54e7bd56d1dd6b2d9ca4aa2b693920e9e8ca191e\n\nThe VIX had the biggest red close since June 15th… the day of FOMC. I still struggle to short this until we see the VIX do something other than drop every single day. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a GREAT day I turned into an L by not following my own rules of course. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ytsqzdo8kf91.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c84e9c9985f21267473f7381aaf4205a4fbb85\n\nI played that morning drop pretty nicely. Got out for a 21.1% gain (of course it pretty much went straight to 100% right after… ) but got caught at what looked like a clear support break and close under 8ema only to get burnt. I didn’t manage my risk well enough and from there it was pretty much over. And then they faked me out with the head and shoulders on the 15min and break of momentum only to rip it even higher. \n\nTodays lesson… stick to your rules AND never ever fight momentum. The momentum today especially on the volumes was some of the stupidest extreme bull momentum ive seen yet. \n\nTomorrows a new day and a new chance. \n\nI am carrying some 9dte Apple 152.5 puts overnight that I do suspect by next week to at minimum break even.

Today was even more impressively frustrating as from 11am until 1145am on SPY and from 11am until noon and 2pm until 245pm on VOLSPD the bears had locked in what we call extreme momentum. This was the first extreme bear momentum I have seen in weeks. Usually once a level of extreme momentum like this is locked in it takes a big move to get that momentum to break, however, the bulls both times broke that momentum and 180’d this. \n\nThe dips are still call buying opportunities… the MM are just getting better and better at selling these red days and trapping the bears. \n\nSo a few very interesting things to note that has changed from last night around 7pm until now… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptq8o70xwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4e4286a69147842e5d8949343ff3d95063e27bc\n\nLast night markets had price in an 87% chance of a 50bps hike for the September meeting after this mornings employment numbers the market now is nearly 50/50 whether it’s a 50bps or 75bps hike. Was that unbelievable drop pre market the market pricing it in already? Or does that still need to be priced in? Will markets not care until CPI Wednesday? So there is this too which is interesting…\n\nI took this picture last night of the expected CPI when I was making my CPI post… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zydhdxlxwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30745cfa02d835c76a22ff01aa3e31c498596d33\n\nCheck out the consensus… they actually today (at some point) lowered the expected CPI consensus by 0.2%. I find this very odd and suspicious to say the least that they lowered the expected CPI consensus so close to CPI. \n\nI have two theories on todays actions… 1. The employment numbers clearly caught the MM and markets as a whole by a big surprise… I mean this opening was more red then GDP confirming a recession and gave CPI a run for its money. I believe todays action (especially looking at things like IV rank) shows the MM had today already priced in as a bullish day. It would explain a lot of what happened intraday today. 2. The markets/ feds (whoever you think is in control) realized that with a huge employment number like this with an expected terrible CPI (forecast is 9.1%) markets are panicking. They are doing everything they can to keep this market from crashing into the abyss. \n\nThink about it whats really driving this current bear market rally? Overall after the last CPI and last FOMC markets are pretty much under the impression that the feds about to pivot in September. This is why the GDP/ recession and last CPI is being shrugged off and why you don’t hear the “panic” talk much anymore about the next rate hike, cpi, etc. etc. However, today was the first time the markets really said wow with numbers like this feds aren’t going to pivot and the rate hikes aren’t done yet. Markets are late to react (usually one day) to new like this and I believe we could see that reaction Monday and Tuesday. We have CPI on Wednesday and I think that’s going to be a big deal… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2mc6ycywzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6466782329e218a5e09fcd45571d7245ee4b7d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkg80wuywzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c91d2a367dad95368274183905eb77d9b8635d01\n\nI am still working off the impression that we are consolidating like we did from May 27th until June 8th before the CPI dump. If this is true then Monday (Tuesday at the latest) should start a pretty impressive and aggressive sell off. \n\nThis last week has also set up a pretty large symmetrical breakout/ down (red lines) triangle that will most likely play out Monday if not Tuesday at the latest. Key support is 410.3 (which breaks the overall 8 week long bull channel) and resistance is 413.9. \n\nWe are still stuck right between the daily 100ema and daily 200ema and we need to pretty much wait for one of this to hard break before we can finally see if we are going to 430 or 390s. \n\nIt is important to note that we have not put in a new high since Wednesday so we are starting a lower high trend. If we once again reject that red solid resistance line at 413.9 Monday then I would feel more confident that we are going to drop next week. \n\nKey levels to watch next week remain the 100ema at 407.5 and the 200ema at 417.4. Overall nothing is happening until one of those is broken. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/728od8hzwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b061604c029e31bee552aafa1e8365e17f4268a\n\nThe ES futures daily chart is looking similar yet a little different. I said yesterday “we are here” referring to the June 27th/ 28th candles and had we not had that ridiculous bull run at open and had we crashed down EOD like was expected we would have finished nearly identical to those days. However, we put in yet another doji on the daily. \n\nThe bulls were able to reconfirm bull channel support tho at open and still haven’t broken that 8 week long support line. \n\nWe here too are stuck between the daily 100ema at 4085 and daily 200ema at 4184.\n\nThe symmetrical triangle in play here too shows support at 4115 (which breaks bull channel) and resistance at 4158 (key resistance for the last 3 days) for Monday. \n\nFutures did finally break that extreme bull momentum support line that I mentioned I suspected would happen today since SPY broke its yesterday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hye8ee40xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=141e25ae9398701552d16d5f5147c6812d46a156\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wt5linr0xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=93a688fabee7021c82018d9bf1af5902cb621a27\n\nOverall the weekly SPY and ES futures charts are looking very similar. I am highlighting the May 31st weekly candle here on both SPY and ES. I am looking for a similar pattern to play out next week. This week we attempted to break out of this 415/ 4162 weekly level resistance. We tested this resistance numerous times this week, however, we failed to close over this key weekly resistance every day this week. \n\nI am also seeing that this May 31st weekly candle is the week before June CPI. Which also plays further into line of expectations that Monday and Tuesday is going to lead to a big sell off going into CPI on Wednesday. This would now be the 5th weekly candle to attempt to and fail to break this 415/4162 level. \n\nWe may open Monday red and just drill all week but I suspect Monday we test this level one more time. A rejection here should result in further downside. \n\nKey support for the now 8 week (9 week starting next week) bull channel is 409.1/ 4100. If and when that support is finally blown through I suspect a large selloff fuel by CPI. \n\nIf you read my CPI document you know I expect blood next week. Whether we get that or not? Well that’s a different story. The bulls are still beyond in control its not funny. At every possible weak breaking point they manage to muster together some unexpected strength. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t2usgf1xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc505d116a451d151fb27186fa0cad8e5091b236\n\nApples daily chart is still looking hella bullish with them too refusing to give up any of this relentless bull momentum. However, like SPY yesterday Apple broke the week long extreme bull momentum support line. That’s the first strike the next strike is going to be breaking that bull bull channel support line. \n\nNow despite the bull strength today the daily chart is still looking like we are putting in a teepee (the opposite of a v bottom) top. With the big run up, a doji and now a lower candle I suspect this COULD be the start to the top. \n\nI will be watching closely Monday for this blue support line at 159.8 and the red resistance line at 164.6. Apple has been even putting in large green days or small +/- 0.5% days for the last 8 weeks (minus maybe 2 bigger red days). Overall its going to take some pretty big news to put apple in the ground (it did open down 1.6% today which was a good start…). \n\nThe trend as you can see is Apple puts in a high then has about 2-3 days of small drops before it puts in a massive green day. If this trend continues we should see a small retrace before Tuesday is big green, however, if markets can break this trend and we break that key 159.8 blue bull support line we might finally fill that gap. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpesu332xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b1d4facffa650e00ac2f1d7a09089f16d12a379\n\nThere really isn’t a whole lot to be said about apples weekly besides this 8 week channel is hella impressive. This is actually Apples first 5 green weeks in a row since October 2021. It is also the most impressive bull run Apple has had since Covid recovery…\n\nWeekly support is 160.8 and resistance is 172. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nw96b3r2xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ef5eea1d6576506e48903ed7c5214ac9ad09634\n\nThe VIX continues to impressively unwind. This week with CPI we are either going to see the VIX finally go back to 30 or we are about to see the VIX go back to 15. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/arz6ypi3xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef806e54362b30b7481c6470dd9d1f7c27e6923c\n\nOverall this was actually a great week for me. I had a good time getting back to me taking these quick scalps. \n\nThe biggest L this week came on Wednesday when I let a put run to -73% and refused to close it at -30% when it felt like it wasn’t coming back and then not closing it at -50%. I held onto this loser WAY too long (I didn’t accept how strong the bull momentum was at the time) and that turned a GREAT week into a red week. Overall I am happy with how my week went, the play I made and my win rate. Had I cut this loser it would have changed my week from red to green. I continue at times to take losses fast enough. \n\nToday was a good day with 3 nice scalps. My only regret was that 1dte put. I took it before the mid day reversal (when momentum was at the bear extreme) I hit about 10% profits, however, my conviction based on what I saw was so high I didn’t take profits as I suspect we would see a retest of 409… as you can see how the day went that did not pan out very well for me… I was unsure whether to let this ride to Monday or not. I would need a 409 breakeven Monday in order to see green. \n\nI weighed the risk to reward on this on whether It would be better to salvage this and use the money Monday or whether I thought we would open and drill right to 409 to make it worth holding. In the end I chose to mitigate the loss. This was another good lesson for me that no matter how strong my conviction is and no matter what im seeing and how good it looks and how strongly everyone else also sees what I see… always protect profits. \n\nIn the end I had a great week and felt like myself again this week for the first time in a while. I look forward to next week. \n\nRemember to always have a plan, protect profits, and never get greedy. This market is chewing up and spitting anyone out who remotely get greedy or who thinks they are smarter than the MM is. Overall, protect your profits and protect your portfolio… there are better times ahead of us. \n\nHave a great weekend guys!\n\nNote- I will have a youtube video up tomorrow at some point… DM me if youd like a link as a I do not wanna get banned here but I know a lot of you have been asking about it.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'So I YOLOED profits from SPY puts into Luckin Coffee, not sure when to take profits.

The Nasdaq 100 fell after Micron Technology issued a warning, adding to evidence of chip demand collapsing. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 4.6%, with all 30 companies falling. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Gamestop sputtered as a result of the surge in meme shares.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Investors have become more cautious ahead of the July consumer-price index, which is expected to cool slightly while remaining high. The report will follow recent job data highlighting solid wage growth and US productivity data highlighting another surge in labour costs, which could complicate the Federal Reserve's efforts to control inflation.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Timing the peak in inflation is difficult, especially after June's CPI print was hotter than expected, but being correct has brought investors a handsome return.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;According to data compiled by the Leuthold Group, those who purchased the S&amp;P 500 at major inflation peaks dating back to 1940 saw the index rise 16% on average over the next 12 months. A significant caveat is that the price-to-earnings ratio has previously averaged 12.7 on a normalised basis, compared to above 20 now.\n\n# Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;Biden signs the CHIPs act in order to boost US semiconductor manufacturing and compete with China.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;UK plans for potential power cuts to industries and homes in January.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Russia's Transneft: Ukrtransnafta stops pumping Russian oil through Druzhba pipeline to Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia - RIA.\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1wrhwzwbrg91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37b344e5a66135218f5021b2d42995cbe3378c9d\n\n# 🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ravbgnybrg91.png?width=1320&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc9d93869856c8d07ca688e26fb489b5495c0230\n\n## Where are we on the Chart?\n\nBroken record.\n\nIf we can close above 417-418 for a few days, Ill be looking for 430 ish as the next target - with eyes on the next leg up to put us around 450 - 460 around mid to late Sept.

Get ready. 8/9/22 Premarket outlook and Technical Analysis for day trading the SPY. \n\nGoodmorning traders, one day until CPI. Let’s examine what has happen technically coming into CPI. The First thing that I see is that the daily chart’s MACD has flatten out. One of my rules for swing trades is never short on a vertical MACD. Now that it has leveled out now, we may be able to start hunting for shorts. The weekly chart is still the chart in control and it is in its water break or rest area but it still seems to have a little more sideways action baked into it. Remember, when a chart hits its rest area like a runner in a marathon there is a tendency to run in place (consolidate)while it builds energy to go thru the next level or range. This Consolidation on the weekly chart could be a very large range (possible 421 down to 405). The weekly chart also feels like it is at or nearing the top of its current range. With this down move starting to play out before CPI, remember the market is a pricing model that likes to price in event ahead of time. So, we could be setting up for a sell the rumor and buy the fact which goes along with the bizarro world effect we have been in because I can’t imagine CPI being good news. Now if the weekly is the chart in control remember waiting on the turn in the weekly is like waiting on a tanker ship to make a U-turn. Knowing this we have to watch the daily and 4-hour for early signs and entries. This is all setting up for a very nice pop back up during or after the CPI report where we can start looking for swing short.\n\nKey levels to watch for ...

First thing to notice is that we started with an expected move of +/-8.825 for the week, two days have passed and today’s expected move is still over half the weekly’s expected move. This is saying we are going to have a heck of a range today (big move alert). Second, we had a gap down on internals from yesterday that we did not cover so there is still some upside risk coming into today. Technically, the weekly timeframe is the chart in control and based on that chart there appears to still be room to go up. Even though I see room to go up on the weekly it's not much which means the Room to go up could be filled by going sideways being that we are in consolidation mode or rest area for the weekly time frame. I am still not letting go of 418-421 level just yet. The Cpi Could be the boost or last gas effort to get up there. The daily chart is overbought but isn’t quite ready to fall out of bed just yet. Although it is headed down out of overbought territory it has a rest area or consolidation zone to go thru first and with the MACD still on the positive momentum and trend side it's likely we have a last-ditch effort waiting to go back to the upside before a complete breakdown. The 4-hour chart is next up in the rotation and is at the lower part of its range ready to cycle back up and retest the top of the most recent range. Now for CPI numbers, I said earlier this week it would be hard for me to imagine CPI having good news or good numbers. However, for the market to be good\xa0it need only be less than the 9.1 reading from the last CPI. Nobody ever seems to take into consideration the governments cheating by always moving the goal post. We will get a CPI number but it's not the real number because they are overlooking and taking certain things out of the latest calculations of CPI, go back and look at revisions and you will see how they keep raising numbers to be in line with Fed speak. Earlier this week I pointed out that momentum to the upside was fleeting. So, imagine a water hose spewing water and when you cut the water off it doesn't immediately stop spewing water it slows down. If you have the water hose pointed up it slows down and if you move the hose a bit it could still give you that last couple of good sprays before retreating back in the hose. This is where we are on the weekly and daily chart, down to the last one or two good sprays. \n\nKey levels to watch for ... Resistance (jack)412-413, (queen)414-415 and (king)416-420 area. Support (jack)411-410(queen)409-408 and (King)407-403. The main thesis is Bearish bias closing below 411.35 projected target/low of between 411-406. Alt thesis is Bullish bias closing above 411.35 projected target/high 414-420. The numbers were showing bearish thesis however whenever more traders are on one side and we get the opposite reaction that opposite reaction will be super explosive, and that is the set up for today. The current major channel we are in 397-416 and the next major channel up is from 416-425.\xa0 Scenarios for the day: \n\n1) Trend day up we open gap up and start with a fade back toward the previous close.

We also failed to even hit the 30day volume average. Are bulls still exhausted? Is this a buying the rumor sell the news type of event? \n\nTomorrow will be pretty interesting to watch. We obviously saw weakness earlier this week and end of last week. However, its clear that people are still buying but now that we got the CPI news what is the next bullish catalyst to push us up? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wleu2e3s7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e98a84f02d12badfe6ca263c5dc0139569100f3\n\nSPY has an impressive rising wedge forming on the daily (solid red lines). We rejected it perfectly today. I am surprised we did not break through this resistance today as this felt like an easy layup for the bulls to take spy to a 3% plus green day. \n\nNext major resistance I have is at 421.1 and then 423.7. \n\nOne key takeaway I have from today is that we did back test the daily 200ema and we are holding that support very well. I do favor that as a bullish omen for the markets. \n\nWe are seeing an impressive $3.97 gap on the daily though. We now have three pretty large daily gaps with two down near 370s and now this one in the 410s. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmmxq3qs7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a43305755af44e1c3c5f2c2ee2055dcd72f9e2ef\n\nSpy weekly is looking pretty bullish though. We have held the weekly 9 week long bull channel support and now we are looking to test this weekly rising wedge. Resistance for the weekly to watch is 423 and key support is now 415. \n\nIf we continue to trend like this I have little hesitation in saying that we touch the 430s next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmhj7dct7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1013900f7b2941c50e5caafcf0e0fac10b7c22d8\n\nES futures is in the same boat. Key resistance remains at 4223 for the rising wedge and then 4275 for the next rising wedge. \n\nSupport is now at 4184 the daily 200ema followed by 4140. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkuao6yt7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4899599e98b6cb8605ca97329dd67c52d4f2f56\n\nFutures weekly never did confirm the bull support however we are not trending over that weekly resistance level of 4163. A close over that and I do suspect that we see 4300s next week. \n\nRising wedge resistance is 4232 and support is that 4163 level tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yoeyoeku7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebf8a53de06faaae4ad702c0cd8cb90ffae5cd57\n\nApples like that gold fish that no matter how neglected it is, how often you feed it, how often you don’t change the water, or how often the cat tries to eat it… that mofo just don’t quit. \n\nApple broke through the rising wedge (this is the one that spy/ es rejected today… omen for tomorrow? Most likely) and closed over the support level of 168.9. \n\nFrom here apple is on a mission to test the bear market resistance level of 173-174.5 depending on how quickly we get there. We now have two MASSIVE gaps on the Apple daily. We have a $1.86 gap from July 29th and then todays $1.08 gap. When will we fill these gaps? This week? Next week? 2023? Who knows at this point… Apple on a mission for green and I hesitate to bet against that. \n\nKey resistances- 171.8 -&gt; 172.8\n\nKey support- 168.9 -&gt; 166.5 -&gt; 164.9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95lc5i6v7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=902b4257d02803cdaf1ad71b9039f734c801f333\n\nThe VIX has just continued to go lower and lower and lower. I am a little impressed that it bounced directly off my falling wedge support line though and that it didn’t dump into the 18s today. However, the VIX is on an almost 9 week long unwind. \n\nInterestingly enough the bounce today is at the median high level that the VIX spent most of its time at in 2021. The low end is closer to 15.5. If we continue to see the VIX unwind we are going to be looking at a new possible range of 15.5 to 19.75. \n\nHistorically I would say most of 2022 has been spent between 18.6 and 25.5 or 25.5 and 34.7. I would even venture to say that most of 2022 has been spent well over 25.5…. Is there a reversion to mean expected here? Do we short term revert or do we long term revert? \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall today and really this week has been a great week for me. I was swinging that Apple put that I averaged down yesterday. I did attempt to close it EOD yesterday but it didn’t fill missed it by about 10 cents… I was already down over 50% at EOD yesterday. I was able to closer it at open before the IV crush for -84.3%. Overall im still at 1.5x weekly profits with that loss. \n\nI am continuing to capitalize on quick scalps using the 1min/ 5min HA candles with STOCH and VOLD/VOLSPD 1min HA candles. The 20/50emas here have been gold for me. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4rprh1w7yg91.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc5d4a6ac354ff3ab23eb5e50de0ddae975a9e8f\n\nAim small miss small. I am currently 9 for 9 on plays this week and my only red play is that swing play that I opened last week. Overall its been a great week. \n\nToday was a tough one to trade because we had such extreme bull momentum, however, the candles were moving at snail pace all day. Going to be interesting to see what tomorrow brings. \n\nOn one hand this feels like the bulls are exhausted and gives me May FOMC vibes where she dumped like a mofo the next day and on the other hand this felt like a premarket run followed by consolidation all day. EOD I saw some crazy buying coming in on VOLSPD and VOLD. Very organized and consistent buying, however, SPY barely budged and even sold off at the end… I wonder if we just saw a ton of shorts cover EOD. \n\nRemember in this market guys we don’t need to go for homeruns. We don’t need to play every single candle. A 10% win that you let turn into a -20% loser is actually a 30% loser… Be smart out here. \n\nYoutube video be up later tonight', 'label': -1}, {'text': '$SPY $420.69!', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'BBBY 6942 Shares YOLO + AMD Gain', 'label': 1}, {'text': "TSLA to tank by Mid OctoberSmoothbrain thesis:  \n\n* Elon goes to court over twitter Oct 17 \n* He dumping $6.88 B shares (indicating likely current high water mark) \n* Maybe Elon BTFOs Twitter in court, but before that shares are likely to drop because risk-averse traders sell \n* Buy puts \n* ???\n* Profit \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFull disclosure: I bought a put for Nov 18 with $480 strike price.

Well today we saw SPY poke its head over that black dotted resistance line. We also perfectly rejected the 429.4 daily resistance level (that’s the yellowish tan horizontal channel). \n\nWe also saw the support line of that pretty aggressive black dotted bull support line reconfirmed today at open. \n\nOverall tomorrow or Wednesday is shaping up to be the “D-Day” where we are finally going to reachout and touch that solid green bear market resistance line. Tomorrow if we get a bullish enough day we are going to test not only the black solid rising wedge resistance but we are also going to test the green solid bear market resistance line at the same time. Could be a very big make or break type of day with it only being 0.6% away from close today. \n\nMajor resistances tomorrow- \n\n439.3 (daily level resistance) -&gt; 431.8 (bear market resistance and black solid rising wedge resistance)\n\nMajor support tomorrow-\n\n427.2 (black dotted support line) -&gt; 424.8 -&gt; 423 -&gt; 421.4 (red solid bull support line)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y80vmsnozxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95ad6d2814378f99f1b697fb3bc36feb8e0a55f9\n\nFutures is looking pretty similar we see that red solid resistance line broken just barely EOD today and we are holding close to that green solid line. \n\nResistance-\n\n4317 -&gt; 4335 (bear market resistance) \n\nSupport-\n\n4296 (blue solid support line) -&gt; 4252 -&gt; 4210 (daily 8ema)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4umsbspzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c4fee89dea5d6c4bd33a03f19c5391f114ed3d7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxh3vw9pzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb08c9aa832bdcc52b60becbb80b034e501cdda6\n\nOverall SPY and ES futures weeklies are looking pretty similar. \n\nResistance- \n\n432.5/ 4340 (dotted rising wedge resistance, SPY weekly level resistance, and bear market green resistance)\n\nSupport-\n\n420/ 4190\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lm0bglhqzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bf90f67772fa1fedb7b7dae676f861dc4799ec3\n\nApple is absolutely still a madman running like a chicken with its head cut off. \n\nResistance-\n\n174 -&gt; 174.6 (black solid rising wedge/ bear market resistance) \n\nSupport-\n\n173.1 (black extreme rising wedge support) -&gt; 172.1 -&gt; 171\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0e7etn2rzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b9f6b1c912bc471675ce51b53a9e492cf1d0686\n\nInterestingly enough the VIX bounced pretty high today. With a close at 20.34 Friday and an intraday high of 21.74 that was a pretty green open for the VIX. However, like usually throughout the day we saw the VIX slowly unwind and with that SPY go up and up. \n\nAs I mentioned last week im looking for the VIX to break that resistance line and end up somewhere near 22-24 before I assume the top is in. \n\nOverall I will be looking for Spy to touch that 431.8 (daily) bear market resistance and the 432.8 (weekly) bear market resistance lines tomorrow. A hard rejection at either one of those should be assumed as a great put opportunity. I will be watching the daily level first. If we break through it but don’t break through the weekly we can assume the next day the weekly resistance will be taken down. However, if we get stopped in our tracks at 431.8 then I am assuming for the time being we are maxing out. \n\nWith the bigger red open today and the early morning chop and weakness and the continued low volume trading I would not be surprised to see a little consolidation and back testing of support at 427.2 tomorrow and actually attempting bear market break out on Wednesday with the assistance of FOMC minutes at 2pm. FOMC minutes is usually a pretty bullish day and movement and we should suspect nothing less in this current environment we are in (TA has been posted to the server on how to trade Wednesday). \n\n10% challenge-\n\nI didn’t sit down at the computer till closer to 930am this morning cause it was the kiddos first day of school so was playing a little catch up. Overall I was fairly patient today and only made two trades before I had to leave around 230pm. Short trading day for me but overall a good day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lejru4srzxh91.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d9743f1e9553377371ce5969f579dab24c38012\n\nI know the server has been discussing this but premiums continue to move wildly abnormal. I took that put trade around 1030. I went green instantly and then red. I had my 25% stop limit set which should have triggered at 426.5ish, however, I approached there on a bounce saw about -23% then Spy fell back my direction by about 10 cents and all of a sudden I went from -23% to -10%. SPY then came back to me and I was green before my PUT hit the spot price that I entered at. I bailed pretty quickly on that just cause of the abnormal movement. It was extremely odd. \n\nMy call was just as odd today but it was a TOS issue. I bought 25 contracts and when I sold my bot only showed that 1 contract sold, however, I had the profits from all 25 selling. Even my orders for TOS showed that only one sold. It was an odd day for sure. Thankfully finished all green. \n\nDays like today though I do not enjoy trading. I didn’t wanna take calls today cause it was at extreme overbought levels pretty much from 1115 to 1pm when it finally rested. I was comfortable taking the call around 2 when SPY reconfirmed the 8ema as support on the 15minutes and we were showing oversold levels with favorable volume. \n\nThese bull days are even more intense and extreme then the 2021 bull rally was. I was comparing todays and especially Fridays movement to those of 2021 and even the really big days in 2021 (and even in early 2022) that we bullish SPY rested along the way. It would retest the 8ema and sometimes even drop a candle below it. However now we are just seeing these bullish days where the momentum goes green and it never stops and it pretty much negates every indicator out there. And the worse part about it is its not like we have extremely high volume where I can say well yeah everyones buying so it makes sense… we are just not seeing anyone sell right now is the issue. \n\nVideo will be up on youtube later!', 'label': 1}, {'text': "Guess I'm going PUTs on AAPL, TSLA and MSFT", 'label': 1}, {'text': "Guess I'm going PUTs on AAPL, TSLA and MSFT", 'label': 1}, {'text': "Guess I'm going PUTs on AAPL, TSLA and MSFT", 'label': 1}, {'text': '8-16-22 Spy/ ES futures and Apple Daily Market AnalysisMODS- reposting do to other being removed by a correctly spelt word that also happens to be a banned ticker... can we get that fixed please?   \n\nWell as I mentioned yesterday if we hit that 431.8 area and hard reject that you were about to be served the worlds greatest put opportunity. And boy was it an opportunity! I was unfortunately picking the kiddos up and missed it myself but wow talk about a hard reject! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86c67lipd5i91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffde228133d98d7f234668edadf21769197e3163\n\nWell we are quickly eliminating resistance and support lines from the mix. Today we broke below that black dotted support line and we perfectly rejected the red solid rising wedge resistance AND the bear market resistance line while managing to close at the daily level resistance. Lots of resistance here huh? \n\nTomorrow is where things will get interesting. \n\nKey support tomorrow-\n\n427.2 -&gt; 424.8 -&gt; 423.5 (9 week bull support) \n\nKey resistance tomorrow-\n\n429.8 (daily resistance level) -&gt; 431.4 (bear market resistance) -&gt; 434 (red rising wedge resistance)\n\nOverall watching how we reacted here and the fact that we have no had 5 green days in a row (technically one of them was 0.00% but still 5 in a row green) I have a feeling tomorrow we are going to see a red day and test some supports down below. \n\nWe have FOMC minutes tomorrow and while that does not always mean a red or green day usually from 2pm to 3pm we see a fairly big green move when the news it released. I posted to the server my game plane and will update my game plan tomorrow with the premarket post. \n\nI most likely will be looking for a back test of support down near 427.2 and potentially 424.8 if there seems to be a pretty big overnight or morning drop. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfw265dqd5i91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0df906daf2e296f98ca43e59ce764770471d37d4\n\nFutures daily looks a little different in that we broke through the blue resistance line of the rising wedge and we broke through support of it. However, today we did not see the bulls test the ES futures bear market resistance.

However, futures weekly is setting up more like a doji candle at this moment. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8o4ug9sd5i91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9534dd6ec21ad064580c32095020f297e91ba3eb\n\nApple and tech in general today showed the most weakness of the whole market. With apple finishing red and SPY green. Most of the morning Apple showed a great deal of weakness. \n\nCurrently we are seeing a double top with a doji which could signal a small pullback is warranted tomorrow. We are also seeing that 6 day long black solid rising wedge support broken through now. \n\nKey support-\n\n172.1 -&gt; 171 (red dotted rising wedge)\n\nKey resistance-\n\n173.3 -&gt; 174 -&gt; 174.5 (bear market resistance) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11buf2wsd5i91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33403e3ef69d8136d980f7c676a5d6f705533c75\n\nApples weekly is actually setting up for a possible top of this run candle with a current hammer candle developing.

We are finally starting to see some consolidation and sideways movement on the VIX much like we did with the March top. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall great day for me. Played a nice call and a nice put scalp today. Missed the massive dump from 431.8 while getting the kiddos but overall great day and great week so far. \n\nTomorrows FOMC minutes which also brings a great opportunity that I look forward to for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45k8iv1ud5i91.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7d28f860d146a7ebe723d2690e90eac1a6390ce\n\nYoutube will be up later.', 'label': 1}, {'text': '$TSLA 1k calls- wen lambo?', 'label': 1}, {'text': "🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA - Wednesday August 17, 2022# August 16 Recap\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/epp1kwdl85i91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4500ddf4379e7ac4c9be5126b8c62ab5db708d2b\n\nSPY traded in a bull flag during the AM, until about 9:00 UTC-6.

SPY- 422.14 (hit), Apple 171.52 (hit) and VIX 20.59 (hit). So all three conditions to make me consider the top was in hit today… however I did not go long on puts yet today and here is why. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jmw5knf4jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d251511037330a044881177d14b0b2b3f9dcd498\n\nIf you are to put todays (on the left above) and yesterdays (on the right above) 15min intraday trading charts right next to eachother what do you see? You see consolidation. Today we opened pretty deep red and had a nice 30 minute sell off but after that the bulls were just as much in the game as the bears were. This was not some sort of capitulation, top is in, send this to the 360s tomorrow day. This felt almost like a “slip” by the bulls. I did not see the crazy sell pressures and the crazy straight down trend day all day like I was looking for despite hitting all my price targets. The thing that happened was we had a big red pre market that helped us get to those price targets. The actually intraday trading today was essentially just another range day. \n\nI want to have the weekend for the markets and everyone else to maul over whether the next leg down is beginning or not. There are still a few more things I would like to see first. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3n150my4jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a510737b95b36b7b1cb0c3ceb9b49b51dc806da\n\nOn SPY daily chart you can see that we finally broke the 9 week long bull support. And this wasn’t just a small retracement through it like back on August 9th this was a clear break through it. \n\nBear case- We saw the red 9 week long support line broke, the daily 8ema was broken and closed beneath, we failed to resttest the bear market resistance after hitting it, we had 104% of the 30day average volume today (this means that there was a lot of activity as in sellers greatly outweighed buyers… not just that no one was buying). This is the reddest close SPY has had since June 28th which did lead to a small sell off. \n\nBull case- Despite breaking support we still managed to hold 422 as support. SPY has now spent 6 trading days between the 422 and 430 levels. This could be just consolidation with the final rest before we push to the next level up. Despite opening red and immediately selling off the bulls did not let this turn into a massively red day and also prevented the VIX from escalating too much. Despite today being the reddest close for SPY since June 28th which did lead to a 3 day sell off that actually then led to the current rally we are in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfi2ukm5jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca338b125c35906ea821d1677b77b0b1636a7723\n\nThe SPY weekly finished about how I expected with that nice gravestone doji. The candle body also closed below the previous weeks candle. I do believe looking at the weekly candle that we are at the top. However, one thing to note about the December and March tops is that despite similar candles the Friday close and Monday opening price were +0.3% in December and +0.2% in March. So that means we have most likely will open green Monday and we shouldn’t really expect a -2% gap down Monday (this is also why I was okay waiting to open a position). \n\nThe weekly is still holding its 9 week long bull support… the daily breaking its bull support though should mean that Monday we break through our support. \n\nI will be looking for Monday to open below the 428.4 support level. There is very little chance we gap up $6 Monday and hold that all week. \n\nKey major supports for SPY next week-\n\n417.5 (daily 200ema and level support) -&gt; 414.5 (daily 20 ema) -&gt; 412.75 (gap fill)  -&gt; 410 (daily 100ema) -&gt; 405.4 (daily level support and daily 50ema) \n\nKey major resistance for SPY next week-\n\n424.6 (black downward line) -&gt; 429.7 (daily level resistance) -&gt; 431 (weekly bear market resistance line) \n\nOverall when you look at Spy its clear to me that the top is in. There is a slight case to be made that this is consolidation and that we chop here for a week before our next leg down. However, look at the way the market has “turned” and overall sentiment has turned in the market I wouldn’t be surprised to see a flat to red day Monday followed by the leg down. Monday I will most likely go into my puts EOD as long as its not a massively big green day. \n\nIf we happen to get a big green day Monday or come out hella bullish then I would wait until we retest 429.7/ 431 to see if they retest and break through bear market resistance or not. There is a case to be made still for 460 before the next CPI in September. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ajvfyyg6jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33a209d151a07910f9ce1602ace4f260588a246f\n\nFutures daily also broke is red 9 week long bull support finally and still has not touched actual bear market resistance yet. \n\nKey supports-\n\n4188 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 4120 (daily 100ema) -&gt; 4073 (daily 50ema) \n\nKey resistance-\n\n4278 -&gt; 4310 (bear market resistance) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iccj3i27jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d33e0ddec6055c47e030d05ed8633a623c83170\n\nFutures weekly closed out almost identical to spy. We are seeing closer to a true double top here though. Overall I will be looking to see the weekly bear market support of 4275 broken Sunday night at open and from there we should see the start of the sell off. Like SPY though there is always a chance we could see a final green push that touches the actual weekly bear market resistance at 4325 (which would also make a perfect double top) before we see the leg down. Being that SPY touched resistance and ES did not I do have that thought in the back of my head. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uz7j8qn7jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe10607d46561a53a39efd4ef006eddd185d92fa\n\nApple is honestly the main reason I did not go long on puts yet. I see we hit my price target of 172.3 which is great and all but I really wanted to see a bigger sell off. On Apple it bounced off the daily 8ema and did not close below it. This is the reddest day for Apple though since July 18th. \n\nA few things that have me hestitating that the actual top is in is that on Apple we broke the 3 week long black bull support line but we have still not even touched the 9 week long red bull support since July 26th. I would like to see this tested and broken officially. This also was not that red of a day in terms of Apple compared to the green days we have seen Apple having. This really seemed more like a rest day then a true drill day. \n\nKey levels to watch on apple\n\nSupport-\n\n169.9 (red bull support on Monday) -&gt; 167.6 -&gt; 164.9 (gap fill) \n\nResistance- \n\n173 -&gt; 174.5 (bear market resistance)\n\nIf I can see Apple on Monday especially break through that red bull support I would consider some 14-30dte puts to ride down to the 164.9 gap fill. I think that would be a very high probability play. There is another gap down at 157.5 but we could see the gap fill, consolidation and then either move back up or down. So I would hesitate a longer dte here and wouldn’t hold it pass the gap fill. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wovgxoe8jri91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5eaaa694d543bf591ad242d815504251062e798\n\nAlright so the VIX final is doing something right? Well yes and no. So we finally broke this massive falling wedge. So that means bottom of VIX is in and we are going to rocket to 40 right? Well no not really honestly. Despite that we still closed within this 19.5 to 20.5 range. It was a good start for sure. But I like I have said many times before would really like to see VIX close to 22 and put more than one green day in to really sell it. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nAs you guys who follow me or are in the server I really struggled the last month. My main struggle came from failure to mitigate my losses. I would feel so confident in my plays that I would marry them and by time I finally realized how toxic the relationship was for me… they would take everything I have. I finally last week said enough is enough and I have started doing a 20% trailing stop order that is opened with any play I open. I mitigated my losses very well this week. And I was able to lock in a green week this week. It was not some amazingly green week where you put it on your fridge… but it was a really good step forward for me. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/29zog4y8jri91.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a6d85e441c10cd3b5d3a7ae84f7b01a88ad9ac7\n\nOverall I locked in a green week. Again nothing to get too excited about. While its not an excuse but due to a crummy last few weeks I did use about ½ my normal position size Monday through Wednesday which did mean when Thursday came and I finally felt “confident” and took two losses and a loss today that I erased a lot of gains. However, again still a good week. \n\nIt’s a good step forward in being mechanical in taking profits and locking in gains. \n\nI did have a few issues this week with LIMIT orders that I missed probs 5-7 solid plays this week because I could not get filled on a limit order and by time I was ready to be filled the play had moved 10-20% already and then I was chasing. I am going to evaluate going back to market orders for opening like I used to. I did have one case also of a limit sell not being filled but overall my sells have been fine besides one play that missed. \n\nI look forward to this being one big step back in the right direction. \n\nI hope you guys have a great weekend and I will see you guys on Monday ! \n\nYoutube video will be up later… im about to start on it.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'How will SPY close on Monday August 22nd?&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j551gghilui91.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b617915dec2efbebaeb50afbf087dc80cfa1a2c4\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/wt45t6)', 'label': -1}, {'text': "What's the word on TSLA this week with the split coming.[removed]", 'label': -1}, {'text': 'This is the result of 10 billion dollars worth of investment!

If you expected a gap fill today to 421 you also got disappointed. If you expected Spy to do anything but trade within the same about $1 range for 4 hours and 45 minutes you too were disappointed… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wh9ay9kywij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b41f21171222dbc0faf44a20d71285503ad34433\n\nI haven’t really see a day where the majority of price action was all within a tight range like that in a very long time. That was a frustratingly boring day to watch. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvgm4h5zwij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40af3217d6375453a83994854a4390a2b4939970\n\nOn the daily you can see we closed out today as a gravestone doji which I have touched on this many times before. A gravestone doji at the top (as in when price is running up) is usually a bearish reversal, however, when we are seeing a gravestone doji at the bottom of a trend (when price is dropping) then that usually is the signal of the bottom. Look at SPY 8-17, 8-9, 8-2 and Apple 8-9, 8-2, 7-26, and 6-17 for examples of what I mean. \n\nThe most bearish thing that occurred today in my opinion is that we attempted to break through the daily 20ema at 414.9 and pretty much hit a brickwall. Once we hit that price and rejected we never saw it even attempted again. The only small bullish caveat here is that we did wick over the daily 20ema which could be seen as a hint of whats to come. \n\nToday price magnet all day was around 413 so of course that will be where we need to watch the most tomorrow. \n\nWith the gap fill at 421.22 now 2.15% away from close it is harder to imagine that bulls fill that gap tomorrow, however, 2% days are not out of the norm and with the VIX closing just over 24 if that were to unwind back down to 20-21 that would be a big push for SPY green. \n\nKey resistance tomorrow-\n\n415.2 (black resistance line) -&gt; 417.5 (daily resistance level and 200ema at 418) -&gt; 420.1\n\nKey support tomorrow-\n\n411.3 -&gt; 409.4 -&gt; 407.6 (support area for the July 29th to present bull run) \n\nSomething to keep in mind that historically the SPY gaps do usually fill within 2 days… of course this doesn’t always happen but it does have a history of doing so… \n\nOverall I am still expecting that over the next two days we are going to push green and see that gap fill on the daily and weekly. Once that gap is filled I believe we will see Friday turn into a fairly red day as we are going to get JPOW talking at the Jackson Hole which he is going to once again say all the same hawkish things he has said for the last 2 months… expect this time markets are actually listening… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6rn0matzwij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4c95afd3974fd0672eb9b847c12c82eb65ceb79\n\nFutures is what I will keep my biggest eye on as we go forward tonight and tomorrow. \n\nWe saw a nice hold of that key 4120 level. As long as bulls can defend 4120 I do see a case to retest that 4130 level. However, if we do lose (close daily below) 4120 then we most likely are going to be looking for 4000 here by next week. \n\nKey support-\n\n4120 -&gt; 4100 -&gt; 4075 -&gt; 4040 (projected new red bull channel) \n\nKey resistance-\n\n4120 (black resistance line) -&gt; 4158 -&gt; 4184 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 4210\n\nOverall the black resistance line that has been showing this current 3 day down cycle is at 4120 tomorrow. In order for that line to hold and therefore trend we have to see ES close below 4120, open below 4120 and never break 4120 tonight or tomorrow. I do not personally for see that happening. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d3vfsjh0xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d60c69a4b3cd172ff910fe5fa0f14916ba2aceb0\n\nThere really isn’t much to see on SPY weekly but on the futures weekly you can see we also bounced off of the weekly 8/ 20ema which is trending right at 4118. Overall if we were to see a close below that then that would be a very strong indication of downside to come. If those two EMAs hold as support that’s strong bullish case. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uhr71421xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10eda127ba8e591cffca8b513ac440d51c7278cc\n\nUnder SPY I spoke about how a gravestone doji is usually a bullish reversal when we are in a down trend. I highlighted on Apple everytime we had a gravestone doji on Apple daily and you can see almost all of them were followed by a fairly green day. \n\nTo be honest this Apple daily candle closed in no mans land. We are trading within that 166.4 to 167.5 area where due to the gaps and wicks there really hasn’t been much price action at all to gauge sentiment. \n\nWe are nearing the first gap at 165.82 with only 0.9% to go until that gap would be filled tomorrow if we break down.\n\nOverall mostly on Apple I am going to keep a close eye on 166.4. If we were to break down through that support then I would think that the upside for SPY and Apple is more limited this week and that we might either consolidate down here or just drill. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7anznu1xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=79fd01b87493626b07d47a1224af96300c89e51c\n\nApple weekly shows that that 166.4 level is a very key support that we should keep and eye on too. \n\nApple and Spy weekly still do have gaps on their charts. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwlhjv83xij91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=655a6ce205702bf3df406029fdbaff631b852ac8\n\nThe VIX is very interesting here to say the least. So after trading so long down at that 20 level we have now spent two days trading up here around 24. \n\nWe do have the GAP on the VIX which I did mention in my video we have not had one since the June sell off and whenever we do have a VIX gap we don’t usually see it left for more then 2 or 3 days. \n\nVIX also is still rejecting breaking out of this 24.2 level. This is where we continue to keep our eyes on tomorrow. If we break out over 24.2 tomorrow and see 25 then the sell off is likely to come. If we see VIX settle down and we see it start pushing down to 22-23 like it tried to intraday today the gap fill is coming. \n\nThis is one of those times where the VIX actually would be helpful to watch. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nDespite the pretty much terrible chart we had on SPY to trade today I had a good day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhvx7ov3xij91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47419fbdc82a8d1f954db7610988dc9b5a78798f\n\nI took 2 calls for a 10% profit. \n\nI am not sure about you guys but TOS has been really screwing me over lately when it comes to fills and orders… So yesterday you guys know my limit sell skipped over and now today. I opened that put at 9.5 and price hit 10.2 (so I was up 8%) I set a 2% trailing stop limit (purposefully set it at 2% to limit slip) well it triggered of course at 10 premium… however, TOS didn’t fill me till 9.4. Of course im pissed off and contact them why I have nearly $1 of slippage on a contract like that when I was green and all they could tell me was that “that’s just how market orders work… perhaps you should try a limit order never time.”   \n   \n \n\nTo be honest I have been pretty much over TOS/ TDA crap lately and its only getting worse. They truly don’t care about their customers anymore… but that’s a discussion for another time. \n\nOverall a good day despite the fill issue. Looking forward to a possibly better trend or at least wider range day to get some better trades tomorrow too. \n\nSee you guys tomorrow!

Leaving a nice gap at 405.22 to be filled. From 930am till about 1030am the bulls tried as hard as they could to gap fill and failed everytime. This sent us into a pretty convincing sell off. However, the bulls had other plans in mind and from 11am till really the last candle of the day the bulls were in control. The most impressive thing was despite all the times that SPY looked weak and ready to break down with perfect setups and even volume dumping the bulls managed to rip the candles back bullish. I actually am impressive after Friday massively red day and the massive red futures and red gap down we had that the bulls were able to take control the way they did today. \n\nOnce we gap filled 405.2 continued to be support. It was not until the last candle of the day that we finally saw the actual weakness of the day set it with a nice nearly $2 sell off on the last 15minute candle. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/br7bpuokqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9abc28ec28fcc0db77502675210b1ce4e47d48aa\n\nWe are trading below key resistance levels of 405.2 now. With that resistance we should expect to revisit 390 now. As I mentioned we should expect to be able to play level to level on spy and apple. \n\nKey support for tomorrow is going to remain at 402.1. with the blue bull support being at 399.9. \n\nThere is also a projected red bull channel to keep an eye on with support at 402.1 tomorrow. \n\nInterestingly enough this is giving me Monday/ Tuesday flashbacks from last week. We had a big red day followed by a gravestone doji with slightly lower lows made. \n\nOverall looking at the red bull channel we have possible upside of 424.4 this week and the blue bear channel gives potential downside of 395.4 this week. Of course this blue channels support is only projected so the actual downward channel support could be much lower then where we are currently. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/772e7wdlqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bae8a627f397dac89f4f3a56e433127052977f66\n\nOne interesting thing on the weekly that is forming is this solid black falling wedge. This falling wedge could actually result in a breakout to the upside. For this to play out we would have to hold the 401.2 low of day all week though. If we break that 401.2 level then that falling wedge will get negated. \n\nKey weekly resistance remains at 408.4 and major support down at 390.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jspzqzlqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=196f441749f25ecec2479b9fa02bb934021ed342\n\nFutures daily looking the same as SPY with Key support of 4023 over night and tomorrow. From there the blue bear channel support is at 3995 with the red bull channel support at 4032.\n\nUpside potential for the red bull channel is 4332 and blue bull channel potential downside is 3956.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08vi1njmqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e97cc83d51c1cba9007bb7ae1b4417294750a8b\n\nFutures weekly shows the same possible falling wedge with key support being the lod of 4006 to hold the rest of the week. \n\nKey resistance for the weekly is 4112 and key support is 3902.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0s3gg5nqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca1cca36dddec3caef8713f23c0dd134553b378c\n\nApple didn’t really have as dramatic of a day as SPY and they actually didn’t even gap fill completely today. And despite how many times SPY had retest hod apple never actually retested its HOD. \n\nKey support will remain at 159.8 tomorrow and if that breaks we should look for support at 158.2 and eventually gap fill at 157.64.\n\nBlue bear channel support is at 159.2 for tomorrow with the red (this is the 12 week long bull channel) being at 156.8.\n\nThere is actually besides the 12 week bull support line not a smaller bull channel like spy/ es futures has. Therefore upside potential for Apple is 166.8 for blue bull channel resistance and support of 156.8 for downside potential based on the daily trends. \n\nIf we see that 12 week bull support broken that would be a bigger omen for SPY and the markets in general. If we see big tech call that will be extremely bearish for the future. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odcyw4snqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59854a27bdb0ef1599eb3e1a86b528edd7134224\n\nApple weekly does show that same falling wedge that SPY/ ES weeklies are showing. Key support will be at the 159.8 low for that. A key support to break through is the weekly level of 161.1 from there bears will look for support at 157.5. If 161.1 support holds bulls will look for 163.7 and 166.5.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4cfxlmcoqpk91.png?width=358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb08147da117d9fcb91b63e7f25cc13df48b9168\n\nI am actually long on some this Friday and next Friday DTE apple (were ATM) puts. There are a little red right now but with the trend continuing to show weakness by Friday I do plan for these to be fairly green. My target sell for the 4dte is 157.5 and for the 11dte is 154.3.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkiom2uoqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc7e08e997756eef31c295b59553772f5ffa2612\n\nThe VIX had an interesting day today. We had a really massive gap up that was followed by the gap filling and support at 25.5 being retested. That support held perfectly and resulted in a really big bounce up for VIX EOD and a close over 26. We are not trending back in the 25.5 to 34.7 channel that we have spent the majority of 2022 in. this is another bearish omen for the markets. As long as VIX is over 25.5 I do suspect we see downside. We lose 25.5 that will be a reason for the markets to turn around. \n\nSo on Friday I mentioned while I wanted to be bearish I was skeptical. Like I had mentioned the markets need a reason to sell. And today they didn’t have a reason to sell. Almost all day we saw “buy the dip” playing out. It was clear who was in control today. However, EOD there we did see the bears take control with that $2 sell off. With the gap being filled and a rejection of key 405.2 level there could be a reason for the markets to sell off and there could be a reason markets do not want to hold anymore. The media is shifting to a really bearish narrative we haven’t seen since really February or march. This is going to be an interesting week and as long as SPY is below 405.2 resistance I favor a test of 390 support. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7y4uxzfpqpk91.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ee3749eeab0a2f9eb3b053e536cee9d4a7a4114\n\nStraight up bad day for me. Made a great trade in the morning. Got a bad bounce on a fake break down for the -13.2% loss. \n\nI trusted that a range day was building with 404 becoming resistance. I entered a put on that 1230 candle that massively broke down and regrettably broke my rules and entered with a SL. I saw how choppy markets were and “didn’t wanna get stopped out before I would get rewarded” because I was convinced we would see a massive sell off and close under 402.2 support. \n\nWell I was wrong obviously as they gap filled us and then every convincing sell off candle was just ripped back green and when we finally did sell off as I was expecting it was too late. Bad day and bad way to start the week off. No one to blame but myself. \n\nImportant thing for me here is to not over trade and to not break any more of my rules… when you take a tough loss you have to fight back organically. Don’t over trade and definitely don’t revenge trade trying to get back.\n\nYoutube will be up later.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'NAUTI GOLF AND EVOLVE AND TSLA??

However, the bears once again took control today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9lnd67mqwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0326a22e9e8cba3398838df587977958f1f5bb55\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7zjhutbrwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b579d6bba7fdf5b988937098cc0c69ee770ac576\n\nToday we finally saw the 13 week long recovery support line from the June low/ v-bottom break on SPY. This is the same trend line we saw break last Friday on Apple. \n\nWith this trend line broken AND bears finally closing a candle below 391 support and also breaking down to 388.42 intraday today I am officially bearish. I am also bearish due to CPI and FOMC that are coming up soon. Lets talk chart technical and then end of this I will tell you why I am bearish fomc/ cpi and what position I am in because of it. \n\nSPY daily has a nice falling wedge forming right now (black solid lines) this falling wedge gives us a support tomorrow at 387.8 and a resistance of 394.1 (todays HOD). There are fairly high odds that we will see this falling wedges support broken later this week. \n\nKey resistance now will remain at 391 tomorrow as that is the major daily resistance level that we have to watch and that took 3 trading days to finally close below. \n\nWe are still trading within that red bear channel which gives support tomorrow at 382 (-2.2% from close) and gives resistance of 401.1 (+2.6%). Until we see the red bear channel resistance line broken I would hesitate to go long here on calls especially since we broke into the 380s today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1mmct0yrwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=195cc8322cde079120a0bd5769f9bd5fe0b6218c\n\nSpy weekly we did perfectly hold support on that 13 week long weekly bull support line, however, in later you see that Apple and Futures both broke this support so SPY should be to follow next. I mentioned that we should play level to level on SPY now. With the 390 level being breached and the 380s being seen for the first time since middle of July we now are set up in the current trajectory to see 360s-370s by end of September. \n\nKey support is now 390.3 on the weekly chart from there the next major support is 367.1 which is the weekly 200ema. The weekly 200ema is where we bounce aggressively off in June. \n\nKey resistance will be at 396.5 for this week followed by 402.2. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3gdpc7jswam91.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0151ca831620d5e19da8910bd7671d04c862fa0b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xltmuq0twam91.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0478aaecff12d5235ed5780b50d33b56e3867f65\n\nSimilar story as you may expect with futures. We broke under 3900 today for the first time since July 19th. However, as of now the bears were unable to close under key support of 3900. We did see a break down of the 13 week long v-bottom bull support line today also. This should lead to a bearish movement going forward. \n\nKey supports to watch is 3900 -&gt; 3883 (the black solid falling wedge) -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3816.\n\nKey resistance to watch is 3925 -&gt; 3944 (black falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 4025.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yry55rktwam91.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=234a6c74d1c9e698db1b8097c81630095d430732\n\nHere is that weekly futures support line breakdown I was speaking about above. With this line being broken that is incredibly bearish longer term. With this support line being broken this gives rise to test support at 3827 and 3676 (weekly 200ema). I will be watching for futures to finally close under 3900 this week and that will be the longer term signal that 3600s are coming again. \n\nKey resistance remains at 4000 this week. Until this week breaks 4000 I will remain bearish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgqnj98uwam91.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a63a90fe98b5028461427acf0a7a283585ee0fa\n\nApple actually had a fairly bearish day today now only short term but long term. With a close below the daily 200ema for the first time since July this should be a very bearish omen for the future.\n\nKey support remains at 153.2 (falling wedge black solid lines) and then 150 (-3%) for the red bear channel support. \n\nKey resistance is 156 (black falling wedge resistance line) and then 160.3 (+3.6%) for the red bear channel resistance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q68zdctuwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7aadcbd5112f0cf39209cc80d99a01584276e45\n\nThe Apple charts weekly is actually kinda crazy to look at. When you think about the fact that Apple really has survived the best of all the stocks out there (for the most part) its natural that it has the most downside to expect too. The weekly is in a clear downward cycle that looks just like March. With this current downward channel I can expect a possibility that Apple COULD reach 120s by October on the current trajectory. \n\nWith the weekly 13 week long bull support line being broken I fully anticipate further downside on Apple the rest of the week and month. \n\nKey levels\n\n150.3 -&gt; 145.7 -&gt; 141.9 (weekly 100ema) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwr87bdvwam91.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ac7cd683b11458f7b269712835512cdb99c4dc7\n\nThe VIX continues to find support and continues to make new highs. Today we actually made a new recent high again. We backtested the 8ema support and also 25.5 support and held that. We also managed to close over key 26.8 resistance from last week. The VIX appears to be on a trajectory for 30+ which makes a lot of sense when you factor in CPI next Tuesday the 13th and FOMC in 15 days on the 21st. \n\nSpeaking of CPI and FOMC… let me tell you how I am positioned and how I am playing this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcjyz82wwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b77648d58ea96c5c1af5bc0885afb1382e7c0588\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ss3rklmwwam91.png?width=913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33ebb54b816604a309c1187db84a8fd98902137a\n\nI alerted this today and here is why. This is the week before CPI and historically (you guys know I love my historic trends) there is usually a 2 days sell off prior to CPI. In the past 5 CPIs we are actually averaging a total drop of about 2.5% over the two days leading up to CPI. In addition the week before CPI (which is also next week) is averaging a intraweek drop of -2.86% through the week with two of those having a 5%+ drop. If you don’t factor in the last FOMC (the only time we were green the week before FOMC) then we are actually averaging a -4.23% drop the week prior to FOMC. \n\nWith this info you can see how it’s a pretty good odds that we are going to see a sell off EOW here and next week should be red due to the historical trend. Now here is something even more suspicious about this CPI… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grz1ir8xwam91.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5bfbfd1fe43a7d4f33266440c9b58839ce298d1\n\nHistorically the CPI forecast and consensus is released well ahead of the actual CPI reading. The last CPI I know they released CPI about 2-3 week before the physical CPI reading happened. I know in the last there were times it was released just shortly after the previous CPI also. The fact that there is no release of this CPI, the president says inflation hasn’t peaked, technically month over month CPI was 0% so it too didn’t drop just didn’t go up, all the fed members screaming inflations not peaked, and daddy JPOW himself at the Jackson hole saying inflation hasn’t peaked and rate hikes haven’t stopped… I have a feeling this consensus/ forecast has purposefully not been released yet. I think when they release it the number is going to be way higher then the previous 8.5% and when that happens markets are going to panic and we are going to see a very similar June 8th to June 13th CPI drop of 10% in 5 days. \n\nI personally believe we are seeing the bear storm forming and the eye of the hurricane is here right now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0u9rbloxwam91.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a397c362a7209e670933ad81973cf1a950eaec22\n\nI opened this put today. I will hold this put until we break the red resistance of this bear market. If we test and reject the red resistance line I will average this put down. Otherwise I will let this one ride. \n\nI tactfully chose September 21st expiration as that is the FOMC meeting and my goal would be to close this either the Friday before FOMC or the day before FOMC depending on how markets have behaved and reacted to CPI. Another potential take profits are will be 370 as that will be a major support line too. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lql1vj6ywam91.png?width=780&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd2c6e9e945dc36b5c5b0d10b1c7eac4713cd450\n\nAfter last weeks frustration I decided to go down to about a $1000/ position with a -20% stop loss and a 20% take profit set on all orders. I also watch the stochs and whenever I see the stochs hit overbought (if im in call) or over sold (if in puts) on the 1min when im scalping I exit no matter where I am profit wise. \n\nToday was a much needed day for me mentally. The biggest change I made today though besides a slightly smaller position size was that I no longer hesitated in a play. I often found myself waiting and waiting and waiting for all the confirmations only to find I missed the bigger move.

Especially if you read my last night TA where I showed the probability that end of week and next week are red due to CPI/ FOMC (we still have no cpi consensus…).\n\nIf we break the red bear channel down I will get nervous about my 14dte puts, however, if we were to hold the blue resistance line from the 430 top I would not be as worried. There is a nice setup to have a similar trend as August 25th/ 26th with a nice 398 double top forming tomorrow. If markets are setting up similarly to the Jackson hole where they rallied into JPOW speaking only to dump like crazy intraday (he speaks at 910am) we could see a similar move tomorrow. However, there if of course always a chance we see a bigger bounce green and could retest 405 by EOW.\n\nOne of the major bearish things is that the daily 8ema was not broken… I think the correct thesis remains bearish as long as that daily 8ema holds as resistance. \n\nKey support remains- 391.9 and 390.4\n\nKey resistance remains- 398.2 and 405.2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmd3idb8yhm91.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0328db8ab4919d733bf5f59aa6763aebc1963b8d\n\nSPY weekly continues to hold that blue 13 week long recovery line (despite futures/ apple breaking theirs). We are still looking at a downward bear channel on the weekly which could give a potential bounce back to 412.4 (unlikely honestly) this week. \n\nAnother thing to keep an eye on is the current 392.1 weekly candle double bottom that is attempting to form. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q0c7llx8yhm91.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9be406cfa2f379b03e6e8e3c0db23b396c5501bf\n\nFutures daily does not actually show the same v-bottom recovery as SPY. It just shows a near support bounce off that 3883 area to retest daily 8ema resistance before the next leg down. \n\nKey support- 3872\n\nKey resistance- 3988 and 4000\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f2jyhhh9yhm91.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de98c728b3462d311d32528a09eb3f5e9f6015a\n\nFutures weekly is also showing a possible weekly double bottom at 3923 forming if we were to not visit the lows before Fridays market close. \n\nWeekly resistance for this bear channel is 4000 tomorrow with next weekly level resistance at 4025. \n\nWeekly support is 3900 then 3828.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uf3kpy1ayhm91.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cec72f222b84e8da08467fbff9a94c5f615a7d6\n\nApple continues to remain the wild child. Intraday today and yesterday apple actually showed extreme weakness compared to the overall market and SPY. With apple only putting in a 0.93% green day compared to SPYs 1.8% green day Apple lagged most of the day. \n\nI believe part of that reason is that there was no sellers today on SPY hitting under 70mil currently with only 104% of the 30day average volume vs. Apple hitting 87mil and 127% of 30day average. Apple had a lot of sellers today. \n\nI was looking to see if Apple would close its back to back days under the daily 200ema, however, EOD it was able to pop its head over that resistance and couldn’t quite break down there. \n\nWe saw a pretty healthy rejection at 156.5 today and we will continue to look at that as resistance. \n\nKey support- 155.5 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 154 -&gt; 152.2\n\nKey resistance- 156.5 -&gt; 158.9 (red bear channel)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx4jpjoayhm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aec7b99fc4afa9d4db3561285570ef22bfa59292\n\nApples weekly chart continues to remain bearish. It shows that there is room for a potential pump as high as even 161 without breaking that bearish trend down. However, we should look for the weekly 20ema at 157 and weekly 8ema at 159.5 to be heavy resistance if we see upward movement. \n\nKey support remains at 154 and if we were to break 154 I would be looking for 150. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qo8ol5abyhm91.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=935dc72646b736e38f711f59fd84a945ab70dee9\n\nVIX had a pretty large 8.44% sell off day today on this very green market day. It still is holding the recovery channel upward with a trajectory for the 30s. Key level to watch tomorrow remains at 24.3. If that holds and they close it back over 25.5 that would put things back on track for a bigger sell off eow and next week. \n\nI will be posting my CPI breakdown post later tonight. If you read it you will see that I am overall bearish for Friday this week and the rest of next week as historically the week prior to FOMC is a big red week (with previous FOMC the only outlier). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9zgl6sbyhm91.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d786a19a712343a0021dbcbbe7e3c8b69711f84\n\nI am still holding this put and I did average it down after closing bell today. I still see a bigger sell off to come within the next two weeks (most of it happening next week). I do not have plans to average this down again. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1c4guacyhm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c03603d12588f70a7dfd769d2890e4650ab44766\n\nTomorrow, we get yet another jobs report and as I said JPOW speaks “at the CATO institutes 40th annual monetary conference.” What is he going to say? Im not sure but if its anything like Jackon Hole the market is not going to like it. With no CPI forecast still I still forsee a bearish tone from JPOW. There has not been a bullish fed member to speak in a very long time. And finally markets are actually listening to what JPOW is saying. Tomorrows opening is going to be SPICY…\n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bgl2m0wcyhm91.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efc584da070116be665a083a9ac2cf4f527f2cff\n\nOverall a great day for me today. Took a loss on that put when I suspected we were going to see a sell off around 1215 when we broke then 15min 8ema. Other then that I didn’t trade much after 1230 as while I clear saw the bull trend day and that it most likely after that 1215a bounce was not going to break… I had a lot of trust in it and chose to just sit cash instead of trading something I had no conviction in. \n\nYoutube and CPI post will be up later tonight!', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'ENPH is the real breakout #enph #spy', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'SPY Puts down 53% but expires on 9/16, should I take the loss or hold?

Now the question is why was a bearish? \n\nWell going into this week we had the attempted breakout at 430 that led to a massive sell off that led to 3 red weeks with us finally turning in a green week on SPY this week. On a technical standpoint puts made sense and calls would have been against the trend… in addition we had the CPI looming. Going into this week and going into Thursday we had no forecast and we had no consensus on CPI. With literally every single fed member, JPOW himself and heck even Biden saying “inflation has not peaked” with the massive sell off, the suspiciously long time we went with no CPI forecast/ consensus one would assume it was because they were going to predict inflation &gt;8.5% (higher then previous). However, Thursday the forecast came in at 8.1% and today the consensus also came in at 8.1%. \n\nNow that we have seen CPI come in bullish, markets have accepted the fact that we most likely will be seeing a 75bps hike no matter what CPI is and markets clearly rallying despite everything JPOW re-iterated Thursday morning… and now looking at the technical with a massive V bottom rally off 390 (after consolidation) and a break through of the 405.2 level… its pretty hard to not be bullish going into next week.\n\nAfter 405.2 broke intraday today and we held it I took a loss on my then 12dte puts I have no reason to expect a reason for us to go down. Now the only reason I remotely could expect any sort of bigger sell off to break 405.2 next week would be IF CPI comes in dogwater like 9%. If CPI comes in at 8.5% or below markets are about to shrek back to 430 if not higher. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kv3ovp6xwm91.png?width=864&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d3847b0ea297345adb8599983c311c6080d9f1b\n\nLooking at SPY daily you can see we have a very sharp and distinct V bottom using September 1st and September 7th to start the V. We have now held that support for 3 days in a row. I spoke on the fact that in the last 16 days there had only been two times that SPY had back to back green days well this is the first time since the peak at 430 that spy has put in back to back to back green days. This in my opinion is the change of tide. The bear sentiment has left the market. \n\nWe broke through that blue resistance line. This is the line using August 16th and August 26th tops. Breaking this line is saying the bear movement is over and we should be looking for the next bull run. In addition, a close back over that level resistance of 405.2 is extremely bullish especially after a failure to continue lower after breaking 390. While we could see a return back to 390 (but unlikely in current bullish sentiment and news cycle) a closure over 405.2 should lead markets to push back for a 417.3 level test. \n\nBulls managed to close this daily candle completely over the daily 8ema. Until that daily 8eam is broken we should be bullish. \n\nNow today did leave a \\~$2 gap on the daily chart that COULD be filled before we push higher. I do forsee a scenario Monday where we back fill that gap and see a little weakness going into CPI. Actually a red day Monday would give way for four green days in a row after CPI comes in positive. \n\nKey supports- 405.2 (level support) -&gt; 402.7 -&gt; 401.8 (V bottom recovery support) -&gt; 400.4 (gap fill at 400.86) -&gt; 397.8 \n\nKey resistance- 409.6 -&gt; 412 -&gt; 415.3 -&gt; 417.4 (level resistance) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6h9lved7xwm91.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06ef1280e7de67e2bacbda863a16203b9928d905\n\nLooking at SPY weekly we are have broken out of that downward channel on the weekly too. Now the one interesting thing is that SPY weekly did break through the blue June/ July recovery support line (futures and Apple also did), however, despite that being a bearish signal we rallied off of that level. \n\nI called it out earlier in the week but we are seeing a double bottom like formation at 392.2 also on the weekly and closed higher then last weeks candle which should signal upside. With a weekly close back over the daily 8ema and 100ema as long as spy holds the daily and weekly 8emas we should be bullish. \n\nKey support- 390.3\n\nKey resistance- 412.5 -&gt; 426.1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amrjf5x7xwm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa7527fb19b7fbfd22fc44dc2de49d0b11408349\n\nFutures has a similar V shaped recovery also, however, it did not break through its bear run blue resistance line as that was at 4105. While futures did close back over the daily 8ema it did fail to close over the 100ema. \n\nKey support- 4060 (v bottom support) -&gt; 4025 -&gt; 4008 -&gt; 3980\n\nKey resistance- 4092 (blue resistance) -&gt; 4128 -&gt; 4148 -&gt; 4200\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31lra5i8xwm91.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52f32bfa150d8713c893f39713f5cb61fc376bab\n\nFutures weekly did break through that blue support line as I mentioned in SPY, but with this new bounce we will make the new support recovery line. We saw the weekly also break the black bear channel too along with closing back over the 8ema and 100ema. With a level close over 4025 we will next look for 4160 and 4280.\n\nKey support- 4025 -&gt; 3900 (blue bull support)\n\nKey resistance- 4160 -&gt; 4280\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/40erpo09xwm91.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11cf85d6f6dab4325067dce3bb701ce7283e5aa5\n\nI had mentioned that pretty much all week and even some of last week that Apple was looking extremely weak compared to SPY. We did not see that v bottom recovery that futures and SPY were showing form until today. With two intraweek closed below the daily 200ema that would appear to be very bearish, however, we actually saw Apple put in quite a bit of strength today. \n\nApple failed to close over its daily 8ema but we can look for that to take place next week along with pushing for that blue bear resistance from this sell off. \n\nKey support- 156.7 (v bottom support) -&gt; 155.5 (200ema) -&gt; 154.4\n\nKey resistance- 158 -&gt; 160.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f35jp1j9xwm91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1e2b74f697ccb2e88564a611cebe0a1b248160d\n\nNow Apples weekly is where things get a little peculiar when you factor in Apples daily and SPY/ the general market and sentiment shift. \n\nThe apple chart is still holding within the downward channel from the August 15th and August 22nd weekly tops. But unless Apple opens under 156.7 and holds there the remained of the week Monday will most likely open over that level. However, we are seeing a gravestone doji weekly candle closed (the opposite of what we saw the week of August 15th) and this should signal a push green next week. \n\nKey support- 154.7 (blue bull support) -&gt; 154 -&gt; 150.3\n\nKey resistance- 156.7 (bear resistance) -&gt; 161.1 -&gt; 163.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4maeh3axwm91.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8f35581154b61494d684630ebd463a800c0d84e\n\nAs I mentioned on Thursday the VIX had broken the recovery support line and has closed its 3rd consecutive candle below 25.5 With this failure to breakout to 30 and looming bullish (aka lessened fear) of CPI and FOMC coming up we should expect to see the VIX retest the 18s and 19s soon. \n\nWhere am I at now? \n\nOverall going into next week I suspect Monday to be a red day or at a minimum a consolidation day with most like a 0.5 +/- finish. While the markets do expect CPI to be bullish I would be hesitant for the markets to close a 4th green day in a row and then have that proceeded by a good CPI and see 5 green days in a row. Crazier things have happened but after 3 pretty big green days (when you think about the last month of sell off) it would not be surprising to see small decline on Monday. A retest of 405.2 and possibly even a gap fill back to 400 could be in play. \n\nFrom there I do expect now that the forecast and consensus along with the Cleveland Fed CPI all coming in below previous CPI of 8.5% that we will get a “good” CPI reading (good as in reading less than previous CPI of 8.5%). I believe this will start a rally into FOMC (the next Wednesday the 21st). From there markets will get their expected 75bps hike (remember markets don’t like the unexpected so even if bearish… if its known they handle it well) and from there we see a rally through end of September into October which takes us into the next earning season. \n\nTo be honest with CPI expected (and again assuming its good) coming down, the expected 75bps hike and really no new bearish catalysts to be had (unless someone can tell me something im missing here…) once CPI drops on Tuesday… there will be really little reason to not be playing calls into middle of October when we see the next earnings start. These earnings could be the only thing in my opinion that would take the market down but even there I don’t expect any more massive sell offs unless a new catalyst happens. \n\nMy plan-\n\nOvernight calls (small position) 3-5 strikes OTM (going to do some research this weekend on what will be the best play) Monday night into Tuesday morning (for the CPI good reading play). \n\nI will let Tuesday of CPI shake itself out… there is a chance core CPI could come in high and we could see a sell off on that but would be unlikely as long as the actual CPI is decreasing (below 8.5%).\n\nFrom there either Tuesday night (risk on) or Wednesday night (more conservative) I would consider opening some 30-45dte calls on SPY (and possibly Apple). \n\nIf you are aggressive you could open calls on Monday and let those ride also. However, you risk here being wrong about CPI and having CPI cause a major break down. \n\nNote- I will have my FOMC post up next weekend with a trade analysis and trade plan\n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall this was a GREAT week for me… honestly one of the better weeks I have had in a very long time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvghhzyaxwm91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be119a69e9517edf2668a9b6618d339f8284e9f7\n\nSo what did I change this week? I spoke on this a little in my last weeks TA but I went from about $1500-$2000/ entry down to about $700-$1000/ entry. I also over the last few weeks have found myself hesitating on entries. Essentially I would be watching my indicators and see the “perfect” setup forming and I would see what would be a great entry forming, however, I would say well don’t be early…. Be patient… and what I would end up doing is waiting for extra extra confirmation that the trend move I saw was actually happening. This would net me a great entry but I found I was missing such a large % gains because of this. Moves that shoulda easily been resulting in 15-25% gains were being capped at 3-5% gains because by time I was ready to enter the premiums had already priced the move in and the acceleration of the move was already done. This also resulted in many times that if I didn’t immediately enter I would end up red. \n\nWith a little big more aggressiveness… really pro-activeness on entries and recognizing its okay to be wrong as long as I keep a stop loss in place (definitely stuck to my -20% stop loss all week without waver) then I found myself with a much higher win rate and a much higher pay out on the wins I did bring in. This week was a really good mental week for me (and financial week). I look forward to carrying this success and strength into the rest of the month and year. \n\nAnother thing I recognized this week and was able to adapt to was the trend. While I was holding 14dte puts most of the week I did not find myself staying biased the last 3 days. I was able to play the intraday trend while having an overall bearish trend in mind. \n\nThe one thing I could have done differently this week when I look at my 14dte puts I opened after 390 broke and after we closed below 390 was to wait for extra confirmation. I could have waited one more day (which would have definitely resulted in not entering the same puts) and saw that we closed back over 390. A little bit of patience here could have resulted in not even opening that position and that also could have allowed me to more clearly see the support that and strength that 390 was putting in. I did begin middle of the week to recognized the consolidation that was taking place between 401.4 and 390, however, I would have liked to recognize that earlier. The one thing I will say though is that when Apple is known and has been historically driving the markets… when apple is continuing to push lower and look heavily bearish despite SPYs movements, its not that out of line to expect SPY to catch up to Apples momentum. However, we saw this week that the general market (non-tech) was driving this rally. \n\nIf you look at my intraday log I did open some 30dte calls on SPY and Apple near EOD today but I did decide to close them before EOD. I was going to be pro-active and let these run after the great CPI forecast and everything but I decided that with 3 green days in a row we should expect a consolidation day and possibly even a bigger red day to fill that gap before CPI starts a potential bull run. After being too aggressive with the put swings im okay with being conservative here… and if I am correct waiting 2 more days to enter calls is not going to make a big difference. The magnitude of this next potential “bear market rally” could take us up near 440-450s by middle to end of October… \n\nYoutube will be up later!', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'What will happen to $qqq and $spy in 15 days?

Until that happens though, [SPY ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/)to 440 before I see any good positions for shorts. Crashes happen fast though who knows on a 6-12 month outlook, but were already down 25% NDX, historically crashes can hit 50% drawdown on NDX easy, but the snapback is always very quick within 1-2 months of the bottom, cant really time these things.

Overall a really tough day to trade. Not only that but the VIX was rising most of the day (which to be expected with CPI tomorrow) and Apple hit 4.3%+ at one point and while Apple was going for ATH it seemed like SPY struggled almost all day. Definitely an interesting disconnected day. I traded until about 1130 and after that I refused to touch it. I didn’t really see any of my idea trade setups today either with the chop and random little dumps SPY would have. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6gm9s8oohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de4a100d5d0f18425d5532fa13a93c9bd7bf13f0\n\nI am going to keep this TA super short and simple and to the point.. why? Well because in the end while technical 100% matter and eventually tomorrow regardless of a big dump or a big pop SPY will find a key level to hug to but until then its just a guess. So lets look at some bigger “targets.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ryn3jouoohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a30c097f2c88154cd936ba0ec57036828e36fda4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2inf6sbpohn91.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6749b63c754a441c8e10040838425b25fd530c3f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4qxo4spohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea44b7bbf448776fbe75bf9357bbabed4576f2eb\n\nCurrently credit Suisse released a report that they think CPI will be 7.9% and forecast/ consensus is 8.1% and Cleveland fed CPI nowcast which is usually pretty close is predicting 8.22%. Overall we should expect to see CPI hit that 7.9 to 8.2% range tomorrow in my opinion. \n\nSo If we get a bullish CPI reading tomorrow then most likely we will see a big green open. The biggest openings we usually have from CPI at 1.4 to 1.8%. So on average we can say a 1.5% +/- opening regardless of reading. \n\nSo if we get a good CPI reading tomorrow we should expect an opening closer to 417. Which would be pretty huge as this would put us right at key 417.3 level resistance. From there that will be a big fight that rages on. \n\nIf we break through that resistance then we should look for 421.22 gap fill.  \n\nHowever, if we get a bad CPI and expect a -1.5% opening we could see 404.8. This would be significant as it would put us back below key level support if 405.3.\n\nBreaking below key 405.3 we could attempt a gap fill down to 400.86. \n\nOverall we can expect high volatility and a good CPI or a bad CPI in my opinion will guide the markets for the next week until FOMC..\n\nIts hard to give a sold TA based prediction here but in my opinion good cpi + 75bps hike= rally…. Bad cpi and 75bps= rally… bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump… bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvgblhfqohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa99af561852e2fa49270a64b8cbf6f7ba2448cc\n\nApple was an absolutely wild child today! Putting in the biggest green day its had since May 27th which was a 4%+ day. \n\nApple also put in a heavy volume day today hitting 149% of its 30day average by close and 125% of its 10day average intraday range. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xj8z7fzqohn91.png?width=584&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40da90dd9d02347a8add0707a0978358cf21cbb8\n\nApple broke through that major resistance from the early august top and that should continue to open up the upside for Apple and the rest of the market as long as CPI comes in strong tomorrow. \n\nWe should expect a solid 3% +/- from Apple tomorrow with a possible range of 168.3 to 158.5. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akxpttfrohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=058f3fc646571020e4edbad0d48400a53469ce8c\n\nNot surprisingly we did see a small green day on the VIX today despite SPY in sell off mode. But that should be expected with CPI tomorrow and the increased “fear” in the market. \n\nI know this post is not like most of my posts but honestly there is little reason to do a complete full blown technical based report when we know that CPI is going to break all norms and cause a bigger move. Tomorrow will be back to your normally scheduled TA… \n\nThe question is what will CPI be? What way will the markets move based on that CPI and what will markets do once they open? \n\n10% challenge-\n\nAs I had said today was one of those days where the way spy and the markets moved none of my ideal setups were hitting and if I had wanted to enter a trade I would have needed to break my rules.

Year over year core had not gone up since April this year. I took a calculated risk with the information I had and honestly with what I knew then I woulda made the same play. Win some you lose some… this is why plays like that should be small in size. \n\nThe worst part is prior to the bullish pop last week in the market I was bearish going into the CPI meeting and was expecting a dump. Got shaken out and bull trapped with the lower then expected consensus and forecast… the psyops continue. \n\nAnyways moving on! Today was the worst day in the markets since the June 2020 the Covid crash. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z8ca3rwxton91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20b6b89d6dd6357eb10e8d20f17713b689d29071\n\nToday was the 5th largest daily point loss in the whole history of the S&amp;p500. \n\nSo lets take a second and lets think about WHY we sold off so aggressively. \n\nGoing into today markets knew (it was bout a 91% chance) that we would get a 75bps hike and they THOUGHT that inflation would peak. This morning markets realized inflation did not peak (per core), the 75bps rate hike might not be enough to fight inflation so a 100bps hike could be needed, and they are also accepting more and more that a soft landing is not going to happen. \n\nMarkets are not in a rock and a hard place. They were previously rallying on news that few were going to pivot (July to august run) and then Jackson hole slapped markets to reality that was not going to happen. However, markets were feeling pretty bullish going into this CPI. Now that markets realize there is nothing to be bullish about this is where things get interesting. \n\nIs this the start of a capitulation like sell off we saw in June around that CPI (remember it dropped 10.3% in 3 days) or was this a massive market over-reaction to a potential 100bps rate hike that was not even mentioned to begin with? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xg2fd3fyton91.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff1a3b52ce9ad7e5c32a7d777b5deb92997d8066\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olcyivwyton91.png?width=775&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d107a4730e71ec34fe9c097aabec05a8b4af2fef\n\nToday we broke down and opened below the 405.2 daily resistance level and didn’t quite make it to that 390 level. We have not broken back below the red dotted support line using the June low and sept 6th low for support. \n\nWe are looking at a potential blue bear channel which gives EOW support near 380 (-3.4%) or the black bear channel which gives a deeper sell off of 362 (-8%). \n\nThe one thing that is for sure is that we broke through the v shaped recovery support and the next major support test comes at 390.5. This is where I suspect if the bulls are going to put up a fight that it happens. However, if we are to close a candle in the 380s tomorrow or later this week then it would appear we could be in a bigger sell off until FOMC. \n\nKey supports tomorrow- 391.1 -&gt; 390.5 -&gt; 388.5 -&gt; 386.8 -&gt; 382 -&gt; 368.3\n\nKey resistance tomorrow- 395.3 -&gt; 400.4 -&gt; 402\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bp1ysjgzton91.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f47e77e7e570fe7b04635df99b4084d825b8e14\n\nSPY weekly is starting to show more and more of this current black weekly downward channel.

The biggest take away on Apple is that it did break through its red dotted support line from the June recovery. In addition it closed back below the daily 200ema and closed lower then any of the candles last week during the sell off. \n\nBlack bear support line comes in at 139 and blue bear support comes in at 148 for the EOW potential targets. \n\nKey supports tomorrow- 151.5 -&gt; 148.7 -&gt; 149.4 -&gt; 147\n\nKey resistance tomorrow- 157.4 -&gt; 159.9\n\nUnlike SPY (thanks to apples huge 4% day yesterday) there is no gap left on the daily chart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1y0t7km1uon91.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61cb2a0add86a0d1831cc3cbc85a4e61cd0967d3\n\nIn terms of bearish and clean looking charts this apple weakly chart does look extremely clear in what trend we are clearly in with a break in the weekly support line. \n\nKey support- 150.2 -&gt; 148.8\n\nKey resistance- 157.5 -&gt; 161\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgw37j52uon91.png?width=933&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc2c9cdbbe1cb56c3092a22a940fcef3ce2d07ca\n\nThe VIX is where things are going to get a little interesting. You can see how many times we have found ourselves over this 26.9 level but unable to push any higher. There is an obvious reason to suspect we are still in a bullish channel up on the VIX, however, previous to today that channel was breaking down and we were trending clearly back under 25.5. \n\nWhile a 14.33% green move on the VIX is big when we look at other VIX days from this year we have plenty of 20%+ moves on the VIX. There was even part of the day today where the vix showed weakness and had even broke back below 25.5 before the EOD push up on the VIX and down on SPY.\n\nKey level to watch tomorrow for the VIX is 28.3 and 26.8. I am wondering with how disconnect the VIX has been from reality and the markets since really the June lows if we could see a major sell off on the markets without getting the vix back to 35-40. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jsm9kmr2uon91.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ec8177b4bd3ed9c28b51d011ea2b9512800f799\n\nYes my call was worthless… yes it sucked.

If you like the play still you can secure profits and open a new position size with profits. 2. I said that the #1 thing that makes people burn their rules and burn their accounts is when an outlier day (such as a straight trend day) happens and they expect that outlier to be the norm.

This is the first time there has been back to back candles closed below the daily 200ema since May. \n\nMajor support is being established at this 153.8 to 154.5 level and major resistance is starting to form at 157.4. Today I did play a few plays based off the bounces here on support and resistance. Apple actually was a much better trade most of the day then SPY was. I was tempted to dabble in some tesla plays today too but withheld the temptation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zht0gd93lwn91.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a2c97d91cfbaaf139daf12f3a87ae4715e301cb\n\nThe VIX did a whole lot of nothing today seeing a mild decline and closing back below that key 26.9 level. The VIX is not going to work its way back down to test 25.5.. a break and closure below 25.5 would signal a potential bottom. \n\nFor me while the VIX really has been disconnected from reality… I would not be positioning myself too long or too aggressively short until the VIX breaks and closes of 28. I also struggle going long on calls while VIX is over 25.5. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwjsilr3lwn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c9208d5289944009b9d92b213ddc1956e07d80b\n\nSo something to keep in mind that is happening this Friday is that it is Quad witching day. Ironically the last quad witching day on June 17th was the bottom and the low of the year so far. While the day itself was uneventful and pretty much just chopped all day and ranged it did put in a bottom and cause one heck of an impressive rally. \n\nIf we look at March 18th quad witching day that also happens to coincide with a pretty impressive rally. Is it possible that Friday will be the “bottom” and we see a rally develop? \n\nIf we think about it while the markets yesterday realized how screwed we are long term the fact that we did not dump today says a lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qrkpf5d4lwn91.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e61ace70c012ad712b4f863131ee8e2574d11a8\n\nInterestingly enough last night and at open today there was a 30-33% chance of a 100bps hike at the meeting on Sept 21st. However, you can see that the % chance has already declined to 25%. \n\nThere is potential markets hella over-reacted thinking we get a 100bps hike, we consolidate in this 390-405 range until FOMC and when we do get the 75bps hike markets see a bit of a relief rally. There is no FOMC until November so there would be no more fear in the markets and the fear of a 100bps at next meeting wouldn’t really be a factor until next months CPI. \n\nRemember it is 100x harder for markets to sell off like yesterday and 100x more natural for market to trend up then down. Markets NEED a reason to sell… the question now is what is the reason… And what is that potential next catalyst you may ask? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oyh7bkt4lwn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=176801e0de961d7f0dea72c15a3cdd137609bd41\n\nCurrently there is a railroad strike that tomorrow would be the last day to “settle” it before Fridays cooling off strike period ends and we may see a world of hurt start. \n\nI feel like a lot of people fail to realize just how much cargo and liquids are transported by rail still in our country. This strike could potentially cause inflation and supply chain issues to get even worse than they already are. The markets very much so could negatively react to this. There were some sell offs today on news but so far the algos haven’t hooked up on much yet. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1f2ujfa5lwn91.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dc78bb17f125b95058c7ca5e0f6b70cc9532f6e\n\nI had a really great day trading. I actually did the first 4 trades within the first hour of the markets opening which is not common for me. But lately the first hour has been really nice movements and technical and then the rest of the day much like today was just choppy trash not worth trading. \n\nI also played a few Apple options todays too. Apple as I mentioned above actually has been looking much smoother and better to trade then SPY has lately. I will look to continue to capitalize on Apple. \n\nGood day for me today hope you guys had a good day too. \n\nYoutube video will be up later!', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'TSLA saving my Portfolio through this depression!', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'First Tenbagger+ gain 1000% $1.8k &gt; $21k on SPY PUTS today', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Honest opinions on SPY outlook[removed]', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'SPY - The Most Important Trend Line to Watch 👀 9/14 update&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2022 support &amp; resistance](https://preview.redd.it/mtv0kogdtvn91.png?width=2378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b7e3a7b44f8070904ef6a5febd9a885b8386ff7)\n\nFollowing up [yesterday\'s post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xdmkex/spy_the_most_important_trend_line_to_watch/).

I love this stock!Tesla is now in second place for total sh0rt 1nteres1 (mods 🥱)I like this stock.\n\nIt is time. Unlike other fake messiahs like RC, Elon has literally risked his career supporting our giddy adventures. Love it or hate it, Tesla RIPS. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However I’m thinking about a few things:\n\nPresidential cycles: \n\n(formatted weird due to some rules)\n\nFor like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year.\n\nTesla’s trend:\n\nAbsolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, I’m doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD.\n\nNOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY:\n\nIt really isn’t. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elon’s commitment to R&amp;D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, it’s just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I don’t expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but I’d rather bet on the company with the biggest head start.\n\nElon Musk:\n\nYou gotta love him. He’s helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And he’s an absolute savage. I’m also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as he’s already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors.\n\nTLDR: Why the fuck haven’t we rallied behind Elon more. He literally risks his career by tweeting and supporting our antics. RC is a fraud and some of you still support him?! If you don’t like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk. Now, most of our wife’s boyfriends can afford it. What if elon gets us to MARS in 2 years?

FSR also beat its most recent earnings.\n\nNoting that [short interest is currently &gt; 28%](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest), at 45,642,188 shares, with FSR being the 27th most shorted security on the list. In the previous 52 week period, Fisker has traded as high as $23.75 and more recently as low as $7.95. $FSR is currently trading right around $9.00.\n\nFor those who haven\'t been watching, *FSR is sitting on cash as it goes into production in November*, currently about 60 days out. The company has approaching 60,000 confirmed reservations, a modest but loyal cult following, a somewhat-polarizing CEO with an established name in the industry, and is outsourcing production to [Magna Steyr](https://www.magna.com/company/company-information/magna-groups/magna-steyr) (who are an established vehicle manufacturing leader, and also produce vehicles for BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar, etc). Although the initial Fisker vehicles likely won\'t qualify for US tax incentives, demand remains strong both in the US and European markets, and long term plans include US production of future models.\n\nPersonally, near term I am expecting FSR to rise a bit on rumors as we approach production in November, after which the initial reception of the vehicles will probably predict the price action going forward. **My current positions** are 225 calls and 60 calendar spreads targeting a near term (@60dte) price action in the $11-$14 range, with leaps for 2024 starting at $15. This is not quite a YOLO for me, but it is a significant bet, and I actually believe in the stated outcomes.\n\nFSR is probably not a Tesla killer and may not survive the rapidly changing EV market going forward, and I\'m not here to say that it is, Fisker needs to prove that on its own.\n\nMy argument is simply that, *at this time*, this is a [real company](https://www.fiskerinc.com/), sitting on cash, with real customers, [good PR](https://fiskerati.com/) creating actual demand, respected manufacturing business partners, trading near its all time low, a couple of months before the long-awaited deliveries begin.

Not only that but with apple at times up 2% and spy down 1% there was a lot of divergence in the markets and the VIX was disconnected (as I mentioned most likely would be).

I wasn’t going to swing calls but this play is about 10% of my normal position size so even if we go to zero its like taking a 15-20% stop loss on a normal sized played so I liked the risk… Overall I will close this at open regardless of trend… unless it opens red then I will wait until fomc presser at 230 and attempt to close it on the run up. \n\nGood luck tomorrow.

Lets set the scene here… \n\nThe last time we had 5 red days in a row was July 8th to July 14th where SPY dropped from 390.64 to 371.04. The 6th day was a huge 1.91% green day. Before that was the June CPI/ FOMC drop where we put 5 red days in a row with a drop from 415.82 to 370.59. There was one green day (fomc) of 1.43% then we had 2 more red days down to 362.17. From there we saw a bigger pop of 3 of 4 days being green and going from 362.17 to 390.09. There has not been an instance of 6 red days in a row on SPY since Feb 2020. \n\nWe have to ask ourselves are we in the same level of turmoil as Feb 2020? I would say no we are not. But we are clearly in a pretty bearish period of time in the markets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9t02og5dj9q91.png?width=844&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f32fa0e1647668cf9ebcc2fa89479db2e6f2ecf\n\nGot a lot going on the daily chart but let me explain. I had mentioned the similarities for June 8th to June 17th on the SPY chart and this daily candle close today just made it even more similar. On June 16th we put in a candle of 370.94 to 364.08 followed be a 369.38 to 362.17 candle (that would be two back to back candles with a slightly lower high and a slightly lower low). Friday was 370.62 to 363.29 and today was 370.21 to 363.03… the exact same thing.\n\nThis to me could be a very large double bottom forming on SPY. Now only that but that June 17th low as I mentioned came after a 7 out of 8 red day stretch and SPY currently just put in its 8th red day out of the last 10 trading days. If spy is going to bounce its here… and if its not going to bounce the massive face melting dump is about to begin… Failure for SPY to make a new low for the year twice now sends a pretty big message especially with these large EOD intraday v bottoms we are seeing. Todays price action brought spy to the 75% retracement of the 2022 bear channel also. \n\nMy anticipation here after 5 red days in a row is that we are going to see a large green day tomorrow and most likely will close over 370.6 resistance. From there I would anticipate a move back to 380-390 by end of week much like we saw at the June low. \n\nKey support- 362.2 -&gt;358.1 \n\nKey resistance- 366.5 -&gt; 370.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp6xmgmdj9q91.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f8e673f7db55404f408fa31c0f265cec5efedb8\n\nFutures is looking to close it lowest candle of the year currently.

Apple and overall tech today held up much better then SPY. What I am seeing which is the same as last week is that this is not a NASDAQ driven sell off. I tend to be bullish on Apple as long as it holds 149.2.\n\nKey support- 149.2 -&gt; 147.1 \n\nKey resistance- 151.1 -&gt; 152.4 -&gt; 154.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nwx1iz6fj9q91.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6cc412f9f4d38e30a34bb11f05cb2fda8e3fef9\n\nQuite a bit to unpack here on the Tesla daily. I mentioned last week I forsaw after the 312 rejection a possible head and shoulders forming with a target of 222-250 (blue arrows for visual). However, looking at the smaller red arrows we actually are forming a possible bullish 270.3 support bounce with a possible target of retesting that 312 level again. \n\nIf tesla closes below 270.3 on the daily chart then I would look for the bigger sell off to play out. However, as long as we are holding support here at 270.3 there is a play on calls to 300-312.\n\nKey support- 270.3 -&gt; 251.2\n\nKey resistance- 283.7 -&gt; 291.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2xaznofj9q91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0be12b8322a23aecc1808ee37f29b8400c2275ff\n\nThe VIX was again on a pretty big mission today and saw a ton of intraday volatility. The one thing I am seeing here is that the VIX still has not broken that black dotted resistance line from the Jan 24 and May 2nd highs… Until that line is broken and until we see SPY break 362.17 (low of year) I am under the impression we hold support here. The VIX really has struggled to stay over 32 barely closing over it today. If the VIX breaks over 33.1 tomorrow and especially over 33.7 tomorrow I would be looking for a bigger sell off on SPY to take place. However, we may see the vix unwind and close back under 29.7 tomorrow which further points to a bigger green day tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/70yqwg7gj9q91.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee7f459afb6f2c20ad0026fea59a9201221f19ef\n\nOverall had a really great day today and the server as a whole had a great day!

I had opened them at market open today. If my thesis holds true these will be itm tomorrow and green. I would like to close them tomorrow if possible but would consider holding till Wednesday if it looks like we are pushing. My first target for selling is the 373.44 gap fill (2.5% from close). If we make a new year low I will close these at a loss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sedj987hj9q91.png?width=1088&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a67c5aac22dbb6ee266986f3aa95bb9aa39970f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpzr46ohj9q91.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a950d6ba3627d27eb841b28802e4b9f460dffb88\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zvksw4ij9q91.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9674fd917f38e5342803dc843ecd88949a8caff6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l5mv83mij9q91.png?width=988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4fbef67e4b079aeb7370e62c46c88912ced610c\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hcw74h1jj9q91.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa514b7a5aa22d195b7a3d1bb29a87786bf746e0\n\nOverall pretty great day today despite the big morning reversal and high volatility. \n\nRemember when the VIX is over 30 (aka high volatility) we should be risk off here… we should be less greedy and should be careful of rogue moves up or down. Protect profits, preserve capital and live to trade another day. \n\nYoutube will be up later tonight', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Nvda after hours whats going on', 'label': -1}, {'text': '9-27-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisAs exciting as it is to live through these “once in life time moments” they are getting quite old. Today we just closed our 6th red day in a row… This is something that has not happened since the Feb 2020 covid crash which saw 7 red days in a row and dropped 15.7% over that time period. \n\nSPY currently has fallen 7.4% over 6 days now. Kinda crazy to think we have had 6 red days in a row for the first time in 2.5 years yet we have only fallen half the distance that the covid crash saw. However, since August 16th (30 trading days) we have seen a total drop of 16.5%... falling just a few % short of the March 29th to May 20th 17.7% sell off over 38 days before we finally saw a meaningful bounce. With SPY officially putting a new low of year in here, the VIX making a new higher high (breaking the downward trend started in January) its hard to be bullish here especially with from what I have seen besides the CPI -4.35% red day I haven’t felt “capitulation” or that fear pumping scary that the bottoms never coming sell off. \n\nCNBC on Friday mentioned that historically this is the “worst week of the year for stocks” with the weekly only being down -1.24% total currently… and some -5% to -6% red weeks to compete with… I wonder how this week is going to finish out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkfhdtxyahq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22112a516715d92cf1c159a93a57b3a5e9bfbea5\n\nLooking at SPY weekly here we have the black downward channel still intact, we have a blue falling wedge forming and we also have a red falling wedge forming inside of that falling wedge. \n\nThe one thing that I am really seeing here though is that the red horizontal channel with resistance at 370.6 was broken underneath on September 23rd and we have now rejected that resistance 3 days in a row and made a new lower low each day. I am actually a little surprised that when we made a new official low for the year that we didn’t just see a face melting dump. We consolidated for almost 3 hours around that 362 level. I do wonder if we are about to see that level broken and see the 350s for the first time since November 2020 tomorrow. Despite the now 6 red days in a row… I have a hard time being bullish while SPY rejects 370 and make a new low for the last 11 days straight. \n\nSupport- 362.1 -&gt; 360.2 (red support) -&gt; 358.2 (blue support) -&gt; 355.4 -&gt; 352.3\n\nResistance- 364.3 -&gt; 365.6 (red resistance) -&gt; 368.2 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 373.7 (blue resistance and gap fill) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31g6d9hzahq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6b228a328b8a341912e0b7d350cedd73b32f1b9\n\nTaking a look at futures we are seeing a fairly similar pattern with the black bear channel and the blue falling wedge. I have highlighted two arrows (in blue) where we could be at. Looking at the trend of two days of sell candles followed by a gravestone doji we could be starting a two day bigger sell off tomorrow. Looking at trends generally when a gravestone doji like todays candle pops up on a downward sell off it usually leads to a continuation not a reversal. I do suspect further downside. I would be bearish based off futures as long as we are making lower lows, closing lower lows and as long as we hold under 3770. \n\nKey support- 3635 -&gt; 3615 (blue support) -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3545\n\nKey resistance- 3670 -&gt; 3706 (blue resistance) -&gt; 3770\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mul8f900bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=381e87f542780f0db41d5345bedf97b0f419ed3c\n\nLooking at apple this morning once again… which has been trend for the last week… we have seen nothing but strength from apple and tech overall. Today however, we did see weakness in the tech side of things with the exception of Apple, Tesla and Nvidia. However despite an early morning breakout attempt we saw weakness end of day and did see apple even flash red momentarily. With a break of that potential V bottom support we should be looking at further downside. \n\nI was as I called out yesterday (before VIX rocketed and SPY made a new lower low) that we would see a potential breakout with a inverse head and shoulders. AS of now that is technically still intact, however, if Apple loses 149.2 that will negate the pattern. With Apple attempting to break out, closing its 4th doji daily candle in a row, and failing to close over its daily 8ema 3 days in a row I would suspect downside to come. \n\nThe thing I am waiting for now that SPY put in a new low is for the tech sell off. SPY is at the 75% retracement of its 2022 bear channel with apple still holding at 50% retracement along with Tesla. Tech is in far better shape then the general stock market and SPY. We have seen a NYSE driven sell off for the last week. The reason in my opinion we haven’t hit capitulation and we haven’t been seeing 3-4%+ sell offs is because people have not abandoned their tech positions yet. If and when tech finally loses support and loses its buy pressure that is when SPY will put the bottom in and that is when we see the worse week in market history play out. As long as Apple and tech in general hold semi bullish… this is likely to be a slow burn sell off. \n\nKey supports- 150.7 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 147.1\n\nKey resistance- 152.4 -&gt; 154.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rabr1ak0bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421f0e076579dbbf7cccfc8a56f8f154fa23a45e\n\nTesla is another one that I was expecting could see a bigger breakout despite a looming downward pattern. With the rejection at daily 8ema and rejecting/ closing below 283.9. I suspect with that big 4 day sell off last week followed by now a 2 day dead cat bounce is about to see its next leg down. Which if Tesla truly is on its next leg down here that means tech could be the catalyst of doom for SPY and the markets. \n\nTesla actually had a ton of movement today with a total of $11.16. Being up almost 4.5% and down the lowest I saw a +0.7% closing up 2.51% may seem like a victory for the tesla bulls, however, to me this showed weakness. I will be keeping an eye on that 283.8 resistance tomorrow. As long as Tesla holds below that I am bearish. Once and If we break through 270.3 support I think that will trigger that bigger sell off I was alluding to. \n\nSupport- 270.3 -&gt; 264.4 (50% retracement/ black falling wedge support) \n\nResistance- 283.8 (falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 292\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gasyw21bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6448fd81850b4f6eed3e8b5f0f007ea3619718d7\n\nJust when I finally said it was time to give up on the VIX and it was no longer pertinent to my everyday trading… it goes and makes itself important again. Today actually was an extreme bearish day overall technical wise. Not only did SPY put in a new lower low for the year we saw the VIX break its black dotted bear channel resistance line that dates back to January 24th 2022. This means the trend of the VIX continuously making lower lows has been broken. The VIX is now pushing higher and higher. Many people have been saying true bottom is not in until we see the VIX hit 40-50… I am not saying that is what is going to happen but this is the highest the VIX has been since the June 16th previous low. The question now is will the VIX attempt to make a 52week high (38.94) tomorrow, or is the VIX reaching max fear levels and much like January, March, May and June when the VIX breached 33.7 the top was in.\n\nI am pretty indifferent here. On one hand historically speaking for 2022 making a new low on SPY, and VIX breaking 33.7 is a time that we should consider going long on some Calls. However, I haven’t really seen that big flip back to bullish sentiment, and we have not seen tech catch up (more like drop down) to the sell of intensity that SPY is experiencing. \n\nThe next few days are going to be interesting on SPY and you can expect with the VIX over 32 again for high volatility and unpredictability. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqhagwr1bhq91.png?width=766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccfb99337d2ece731e9d1ada0d441082a2798fec\n\nYou know honestly not my best day today… I had some 1dte and 3dte calls that were hella red overnight that I swung. Was able to close the 3dte naturally for a nice win at open and then a quick average down at open got me to breakeven on the 1dte calls. \n\nFrom there it was downhill for a little while. I was still under the impression that we were going to be seeing a green close today and I was also under the impression that the bottom was in and that we were going to take 370 out finally. I was very wrong. Thankfully EOD I was able to get on board and able to close out a decent week day. \n\nThis is one of those days where being TOO biased to start the days and being “smarter” than the markets can really hurt you. The best thing I did today was having hard stop loss price targets for my calls. I was able to recognize I COULD be wrong and that if I WAS wrong it was time to GTFO before a manageable loser became an unmanageable loser. \n\nI am very indifferent where markets are going to go from here. On one hand I really do think we could see the 340s-350s this week and on the other hand we are hitting some extreme levels on SPY and the VIX and we very well could have just put the bottom in. I really don’t know where to go from here… but that’s why when in doubt we don’t swing and why for the most part I recommend intraday plays. \n\nOverall I think as long as tech holds support (Apple closing over 149.2 and Tesla over 270.1) it is hard for me to be full bear. But in a market as volatile and vulnerable as now anything can happen overnight. \n\nYoutube video be up later tonight\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uag90dc2bhq91.png?width=967&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c06102d15361ce3a98c6c2e79dcaf9c8dbd90a4c', 'label': 1}, {'text': '15k loan to 53k spy yolo.

So take everything I say as a suggestion, not fact with that being said; here is my Idea:\n\nAs we all know now, the combustion engine is slated to be killed, with some companies even stopping production as early as 2025. So suggesting an EV manufacturing company is going to take off isn't a hard thing to believe. What I myself do believe is that Rivian at the moment is falling into obscurity, with a net income of -1.7B, and a 52wk low of just $18.\n\nIf together we let this fall, to its low which by the look of things it's going to do. You could buy it dirt cheap.\n\nBut why, how could a failing EV company grow with subpar vehicles, especially in a growing competitive market?; well Rivian has partnered with Mercedes Benz to bring the first luxury Suv EV to the market.

The first thing I want to touch on is the daily range of SPY today. Lets take a look \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7n48fhiprur91.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1002362aaa2287d0547940f94dd8d1aef1d228f8\n\nAccording to the data that brokers supply us… SPY saw a range of $11.43 with a LOD of 366.57 and a HOD of 377.66, however, SPYs actual LOD is 372.31 and a range of $5.69. So what does this mean? Well the last times this happened I coined it the “phantom range” and everytime it has happened the price of SPY has hit that level either intraday or the next day. This most likely is dark pool prints. \n\nToday was also extremely interesting when we look at the buy pressure, and TRIN. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcapwwxprur91.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e5dc94bc25c3d7a7ca6e9a840e1412bbf4c1cf\n\nLeft side is todays market data which shows that we had a legit buy pressure of almost 2500:1 on SPY this morning and our trin was 0.21 (extreme imbalanced). Then we take a look at yesterday and our buy pressure on that massive run up was 9.72 and our TRIN was 5.05 (also hella imbalanced). \n\nThis is officially the biggest two day rally that SPY has had all year and is the biggest two day rally since April 2020… so what comes next? \n\nWell lets look at WHY the market is even rallying like this… the CNBC current news cycle is set on repeat of “the fed is going to pivot, December is likely the last rate hike…” is this true? No most likely not… JPOW was very clear that we would NOT see a pivot or rate pauses until 2024 most likely. But with BOE and now Austria slowing its rate hikes/ starting QE… markets are rallying on this news. \n\nThere is a chance we are about to go on a massive rally for the next 2 months till the November rate hike and JPOW finally talks again. That or we are seeing an extreme bear market dead cat bounce and the shows about to come to and end soon. Most of the bear market bounces this year are around $20 for low to high… we from Fridays low at $20.96. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eoefi5fqrur91.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7b12d0ed958d1707c38d02a8dc30dc7f4e8775\n\nOkay here is the above chart with less lines to make it clear on what im trying to show… We are looking like we are in a pattern just like the March to may sell off followed by an aggressive rally that led to consolidation and then a bigger dump (when CPI hit). I wonder if this pattern is about to play out again. That dump was a bounce form the 75% retracement to the 50% retracement… consolidation then dump to the 2022 bear channel support (around 330-340 depending on timing). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3pl1q2xqrur91.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ce5cf94e8207fc4a517888cbb9e379cba0e4c05\n\nToday we saw SPY with a massive gap up (however, due to the phantom print this gap is now covered) over the daily 8ema and we stopped right at the 20ema. Most of these dead cat bounces have also stopped at the daily 20ema. So we are at a major pivot point here. \n\nThere was on the 15min chart 14 attempts to break 377.3 resistance before it finally in the last minute popped through and closed over it. \n\nIf we see a 3rd day to this rally I will look for resistance of the black bear channel to be tested at 382.2 which is also next resistance. The one thing I am seeing is that this looks very similar to the September 7th to September 12th dead cat bounce. If we look at the stochastics also you can see that we are hitting the same overbought levels that we did back then. While we might get one more push up I do suspect we see downside the end of the week. In order to trust this rally I would like to see 370.6 support back tested and held. \n\nKey support- 375.4 (black support line vbottom) -&gt; 372.4 -&gt; 370.7 -&gt; 366.7\n\nKey resistance- 378 -&gt; 381.4 (black bear channel resistance) -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/738g8lhrrur91.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53f3e8222aef43eb16fbc4148465565bf90399e9\n\nFutures did break through its key black falling wedge resistance. The next major resistance would be up in the 4000s which uses the august and September peaks. Futures also rejected the daily 20ema at the EOD. Unless futures opens green and never loses 3805 support we are going to see that support line broken finally and that could lead to more downside. \n\nKey support- 3805 (black v bottom) -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3735\n\nKey resistance- 3880 -&gt; 3925\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/daomo9xrrur91.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd54541c114bc3bd691fc097d68f57b4448663ad\n\nI am seeing a hanging man candle formed on the Apple daily chart with a rejection of the Daily 8ema. With the phantom print on SPY we are seeing a massive hanging man on spy and the similar one on Apple. Look at the May 17th candle on spy for an idea of what COULD happen. \n\nApple rejected 146 9 times before it finally closed a 15min candle over it EOD. However, even with that close it still is below its daily 8ema. Due to the daily candle structure unless apple opens over 149.4 (2.2% green and holds that all day it will break support and should open the downside). With SPY and Apple I am looking for a double top at 378 and a double top at 146 with a bigger retracement. \n\nBlue bear channel resistance comes in at 148.8 tomorrow which is just below key resistance of 149.4. \n\nKey support- 149.4 (black v bottom support) -&gt; 142.5 -&gt; 141.3 -&gt; 138.2\n\nKey resistance- 146 -&gt; 147.6 -&gt; 149.4 (major resistance) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdyj74gsrur91.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed20bd65dd67af48931f45dac8cf6211d93d6405\n\nAnd then there was Tesla… you gotta love the way this stock moves. Tesla actually looked fairly bullish this morning breaking over yesterdays HOD and looking to test that red falling wedge resistance near 260. However, then ole ELON decided he is gonna buy the twitterpade and well we saw tesla go for $10.86 sell off in less than 15minutes and a total drop of $13.25 over 1.5 hours before it actually attempted to gather some support EOD. I was blessed enough to have some Tesla puts but not blessed enough to get an IV pump on them… Despite teslas impressive drop it actually closed a green day and was able to get over 248.7 resistance that it struggled at for over 11 candles before finally like SPY and Apple EOD was able to close over them. \n\nTesla is peculiar. As it still remains one that has the most to lose as it’s the furthest from its 52week low. Tesla has now also suffered back to back days of “bad news”. Being in the inverse head and shoulders pattern the pattern needs to see 220 to “complete” I do suspect we could see it play out this week. \n\nToday could have definitely been seen as a “rest” day after Tesla got absolutely beat down yesterday. Breaking 242.5 will be the confirmation of downside to come and a close over 255 would signal a possible bigger bounce to test that black bear channel. A breaking of that red support for the falling wedge will be an early signal of the reversal. \n\nKey support- 242.5 -&gt; 237.3 -&gt; 231 (black bear support)\n\nKey resistance- 250 -&gt; 252.4 (red resistance falling wedge) -&gt; 255 -&gt; 260.6 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4dbn9zsrur91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=408068e51fe535684efd9bfeb0cc6d54d2369cb8\n\nThe VIX in all reality did nothing today. It did hold key 28.3 support and the daily 20ema. However, it closed under 30 for the first time since September 23rd. One thing that I am seeing though is a gravestone doji candle body. This appears to have occurred in similar fashion back on September 9th which then led to a massive upturn (granted this was CPI day). \n\nThere is a very big potential with the VIX not unwinding at all on this massive green day on SPY that we could see the VIX revert back to 31-32 tomorrow which would take SPY down and the markets with it. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nSome of my least favorite days to trade are days we have massive gap ups at open… when we have back to back days of gap ups with extremely weird technical (trin, buy pressure, vold, etc. etc.) I know there is little risk to reward. I played a morning tesla put when I saw weakness in Tesla and was reward thanks to musk but I believe either way I would have been by EOW. From there I didn’t play much else besides closing my 28dte call on SPY and playing one quick SPX scalp. \n\nA great trader KNOWS when the technical do not favor their strategy. An even greater trader knows when not to trade and that’s there will always be another day to trade. Today to me was a clear day \n\nYoutube will be up later tonight! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjc1irntrur91.png?width=1016&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5e5b1494285d36d036611de54844e8c262f9af\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sarwy35urur91.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c189ac6e726fb66088274be2df865bea05cbb24b\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/is4phbpurur91.png?width=1045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cadcbcb9ead741d1dddf06b8fa38aaeb20e8ada\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k07sij4vrur91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f295fbe4e683a9d16a1fa5b8e98ac648cf92548c\n\nBeen a great two days for everyone!', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Will AAPL Apple Hit 120 By November?

We are looking at a pretty fat bodied doji. This should with the two day push, daily 8ema support retest and holding, 370 range support test hold and briefly breaking over 378 before closing just under it provide upside for tomorrow. This to me was a bullish day. We looked extremely doomish this morning and then the bulls stepped in and let this rally almost all day. EOD drop was most likely profit takers. \n\nKey resistance bulls need to conquer tomorrow is the 378 and the daily 20ema. The next major resistance that we will likely push for is 382.1 which puts us through the black bear channel and puts us in line to Friday or next week test the blue bear channel that dates back to August. As long as bulls continue to defend that 370.6 level like they did today I am biased to the upside. \n\nKey support- 373.5 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 366.7\n\nKey resistance- 378 -&gt; 379.8 (black bear channel) -&gt; 382.1 -&gt; 386.4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkst7jsur1s91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a48f24d1280b7c321d2679275164d4e74c4abcc2\n\nIf we look at SPY weekly you can see that there is a pretty big case that we are going to test 3985.2 resistance we also have a very convincing V bottom forming along with retaking the weekly 200ema. If the bulls can take back that weekly 8ema and close over 385.2 this week then that should provide a lot of upside for next week especially with a bullish CPI. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b6t6g09vr1s91.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f9d967aa205975bf1f62684313e483480dc6cd5\n\nFutures put in quite the range from 3734 to 3820 today.

With a back test of 3735 previous resistance that should provide a big support base going forward. \n\nSupport- 3805-&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3735\n\nResistance- 3880 -&gt; 3925\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jlijy8rvr1s91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=865eedfbc3010abfd6a887780b41a11f09d5de17\n\nApple looked stronger then the rest of the market all day today. Even this morning when SPY and Tesla were selling off apple was very delayed in its sell off. The other actually impressive thing is that Apple daily candle closed as a bullish engulfing candle at 0.21% when yesterday was a 2.56% green day. Apple also perfectly back filled its gap which should allow for further upside movement. If bulls can retake that key 149.3 resistance that was heavy support previously that would be very bullish going forward. \n\nKey support- 146 -&gt; 144.2 -&gt; 141.4\n\nKey resistance- 147.7 (blue bear channel) -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 150.8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xn33m1awr1s91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=043947d233c77f3d0681318d85a3e41c44ea9bba\n\nMy tesla pattern that I called out 2 weeks ago when it hit 312 has finally played out completely as far as I am concerned. The low average prior to the move up was 222 and the high average was 242 with 234 being the privot point. With a test and pretty impressive bounce off 233.27 today I actually am expecting quite a bit of upside for tesla eow and even next week. \n\nTesla is down 18% in 5 days, 20% in 6 days and 26% in 11 days... In my opinion it is due for a bounce. I believe yesterday before the Twitter news dropped tesla actually was going for a relief bounce closer to 260. I do believe eventually this downside play needed to happen but now its happened we should be looking for upside. As long as Apple and Spy as pushing tesla should push with it. With the closing of a pretty large dragonfly doji after a massive sell off I am looking for that bounce this week on Tesla. \n\nAnother key thing is that the 5 day long (6 tomorrow) resistance line is in play and unless tesla opens under 239.4 (-0.6%) and holds red all day then we will break that resistance and we should see further upside. There is a small amount of room for the huge falling wedge to play out one more day to the downside and test 226 support but I favor with SPY and Apple looking strong that we do bounce. However, if Apple and SPY come out weak tomorrow like today we should see the 220s hit. \n\nIf the upside doesn’t play out intraweek I suspect it plays out next week. \n\nSupport- 234.6 -&gt; 226.4 -&gt; 222\n\nResistance- 239.4 -&gt; 242.3 -&gt; 249.2 -&gt; 254.7 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23rfmyswr1s91.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b30bdbc38eb95d4873fb5f1432e65040deed048a\n\nThe VIX continues to be overall undecided on what it wants to do holding over that key 28.4 pivot level. However we saw a back test of the daily 8ema resistance which did hold and show sell off into EOD. I suspect the VIX to break under that 28.4 level tomorrow which should provide upside potential for SPY. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nAnother pretty killer day for me today. Most of it came from Swings though. I struggled this morning with the techicals which looking back makes sense because I was attempting to find scalps prior to the v bottom rally. Technicals this morning and early afternoon once again were out of wack but by EOD were playing nicely again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3b4htcxr1s91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84c05a5c624c55cd3a2724d8092a89f4c0097aef\n\nAnother pretty great day in the server today! \n\nYoutube will be posted later! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6aucqduxr1s91.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b26567c38d9500b5282d86e55636009a16b7c564\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2t3r6cnyr1s91.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcbf7c335ecd004a6cab7f3a8b70fc5375701bde', 'label': -1}, {'text': '2023 dec 610 calls (spy)I’m going to keep buying until end of January is this just regarded and I need to stop now or am I onto something (I usually only buy 0-3 dte)', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Puts on $AAPL?! - Apple’s Hidden Update to Discourage Early Credit Payments: “Current Balance” Option Removed from Default Choices', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'PUT it away before you CALL TSLA! 🤨[removed]', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'GOOGL in the midst of breaking out of a tight downward trend.', 'label': -1}, {'text': '1K———&gt;38k in 5 months📈 Started with AMD Calls at the beginning, then SQQQ Calls during the meltdown, TSLA Puts just recently, and now im on OXY and XOM Calls with some energy stocks on the side.', 'label': -1}, {'text': '1K———&gt;38k in 5 months📈 Started with AMD Calls at the beginning, then SQQQ Calls during the meltdown, TSLA Puts just recently, and now im on OXY and XOM Calls with some energy stocks on the side.', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Is it time to start buying long term spy calls?My plan was to ride the bear market with Spy puts for a few weeks and then buy some calls for like a year out since stonks only go up.

Stocks fell as a result of those bets, propelling benchmark treasury yields to their longest weekly gain since 1984.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Almost 95% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 declined. The drop came just a few days after the index posted its biggest back-to-back gains since the pandemic began, amid speculation that the Fed was approaching "peak hawkishness." Despite Friday\'s drop, those gains gave the index its best week in a month. The tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 dropped nearly 4% on Friday.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;10 Yr yields approached 3.9% as they rose for the 10th week in a row. the dollar advanced. The swap contract for the Fed meeting in November factored in nearly 75 basis points of tightening. Market-implied expectations for where the rate will peak also increased, with the derivative contract for the March gathering trading around 4.66%. the current range for the benchmark rate stands between 3% and 3.25%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Fed Bank of New York President John Williams stated that rates need to gradually rise to around 4.5%, but the pace and ultimate peak of the tightening campaign will be determined by how the economy performs. Several officials delivered a resolutely hawkish message this week, saying that price pressures remain elevated and that financial market volatility will not deter them from raising rates.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;After a hotter-than-expected reading in August dampened hopes of a nascent slowdown, all eyes will be on next week\'s US inflation data. Separately, the Fed\'s September meeting minutes could reveal the central bank\'s tolerance for economic pain.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Investors poured the most money into cash since April 2020, fearing a looming recession, but stocks could fall further because they don\'t fully reflect that risk, according to Bank of America strategists. According to their report, cash funds received nearly $89 billion in the week ending October 5th, while investors withdrew $3.3 billion from global stock funds.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;ECB\'s Nagel: We anticipate 1.3% to 1.5% economic growth in Germany in 2022, with growth remaining flat in 2023.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nECB\'s Nagel: We\'ll probably see minor decline in GDP as early as Q3 this year, which is likely to amplify in Q4 and continue in early 2023.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nFed\'s Williams: Over time, the Fed should raise rates to around 4.5%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nFed\'s Williams: I believe that growth will be positive next year, but unemployment will rise.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nUS interest rate futures price in 92% chance of a 75-basis-point Fed rate hike in November, up from 85.5% before September jobs report.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n**US Nonfarm Payrolls Actual 263k (Forecast 255k, Previous 315k)** (Dollar strengthened, S&amp;P 500 weakened, US 10-Y yield strengthened)\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3rm51kg9ls91.png?width=1288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a60e9fbe47990fc0b03b4c60352b8b7b2ec97ea\n\n# 🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/965sgjti9ls91.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=815490cc9623ae6d88b544ee2e1e2aedc88d40bc\n\nFib.

We then moved down and tested 200 MA on 2 min - trading in a triangle. In the triangle, we rejected the anchored VWAP and slipped through the 200 MA. We backtested the 200 MA at about 8:00 UTC-6 and rejected, hitting 360.97 target on scalping chart. For the next hour, we traded in a h&amp;s pattern. Full measured move from neckline break was 357.89 and we hit that EOD.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zkam2v9jb6u91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a50b2bfa2a56ffe24b20c6affa3ad2750e808ff\n\nWe are at support level of 4 hr. rectangle again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wf2uslkb6u91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ff5c364865b02383201aa79fcef8abfcd905981\n\nI took two trades today.

The Dollar rose while Treasuries fell.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe S&amp;P 500 finished near the day's lows, down more than 2%. The growth-sensitive Nasdaq 100 fell the most, dropping nearly 3% as Treasury yields rose, with the 2-year rate returning to 4.5%. Both indices experienced their first weekly declines of the month.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nEquity markets fell sharply after a University of Michigan survey found that year-ahead inflation expectations rose in early October, while the long-term outlook improved. The increase may be concerning for the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep views anchored. It also comes on the heels of data released the day before that showed a key measure of consumer prices accelerated to a 40-year high in September. However, stocks roared back from early losses on Thursday, in one of the biggest reversals in history.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nIn the most recent Fed comments, officials indicated that they are prepared to raise rates more aggressively than previously planned. Kansas City Fed President Esther George stated that the terminal rate may need to be raised in order to cool prices. The San Francisco Fed's Mary Daly stated that raising to restrictive levels and to between 4.5% and 5% is the most likely outcome.  \nForecasts released last month showed rates reaching 4.4% by the end of the year and 4.6% the following year, up from a current target range of 3% to 3.25%. Following strong payrolls and hot inflation readings, swaps traders have increased bets on rate hikes over the past week, with the market leaning toward back-to-back jumbo hikes at the next two meetings and a high above 4.9% next year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nBonds and the Sterling fell in the United Kingdom, capping off another turbulent week. Gilts fell as Prime Minister Liz Truss confirmed a reversal on a planned corporation tax freeze. On Friday, the Bank of England completed its emergency bond purchases, purchasing £1.45 billion in long-dated and inflation-linked Gilts. Following that, 30-year yields rose 23 basis points to 4.78%, following a drop of more than 30 basis points earlier.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;Fed's Bullard: The appropriate rate range should be in the 4.5%-4.75% by the end of the year, with any further increases in 2023 being data dependent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe UK is in talks with US LNG producers about major purchases - Sky.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nUK's PM Truss anticipates that UK's Chancellor Hunt will agree to no more U-turns on the UK tax package, according to person familiar with the matter. (Sterling weakened)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nFed's Daly: 4.5%-5% is most likely the top Fed Funds Rate, and then hold it there.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nFor the first time since March, US 1-Yr inflation expectations have risen.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nUniversity Michigan Sentiment Prelim Actual 59.8 (Forecast 58.8, Previous 58.6) (DXY &amp; 2 Yr Yield strengthened, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Gold weakened)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nUK's PM Truss: We have decided to keep increase in corporation tax.\n\n# 🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA\n\nFib.

Great day in the server despite this wonky day. Looking at last weeks price action I would not have suspected SPY to open 2% green today an hold green all day long. However, CNBC is once again despite the terrible CPI CORE readings and CPI in general that the fed will pause/ pivot in December… Seems like they are doing everything they can to push this market into another July type rally. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sxl4z9szdfu91.png?width=316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de77f1dcda8529cdd7050b2873444bcb6a429c0\n\nWe also just EOD had another phantom range hit the books. I have never ever seen this many phantom ranges hit the books like this before. I really don’t know how to take these. At first it was a guaranteed hit but now we are seeing that not really the case. We still have the untouched/ fill phantom print from October 7th at 373.29. Now we currently have todays phantom bottom at 357.28.

I believe which ever one of these breaks first will be the way we push. Todays price action actually looked extremely similar to October 3rd and 4th. \n\nWhat we saw today was VOLD green pretty much 98% of the day (a handful of red candles) and in extreme bull momentum all day but SPY didn’t push up with it. Spy held the same about $2 range from 1145am till EOD.\n\nWe have two different downward channels a red one and a black one. We also are forming a falling wedge with the red bear channel support and black bear channel resistance. \n\nOverall im bearish under 368.6 with VIX over 31. If those conditions change tomorrow I may start looking for some upside. We are hitting earnings right now with a few decent names this week but most next week. That will be interesting to see how those play out in the market. \n\nKey support- 364 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.4\n\nKey resistance- 368.6 -&gt; 370.8 -&gt; 373.2 -&gt; 378.4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1c67js71efu91.png?width=905&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=836b77c3df627e56565af3d4d7cac2ac8595eac8\n\nFutes is in an overall downward channel that’s black and blue. Currently that black and blue channels also form a falling wedge which we are holding beneath and it also lines up with the key daily 20ema resistance line. \n\nThe biggest bullish thing for today depending on where futes close is that they are holding over and will close over 3680 resistance. Key resistance is that black resistance at 3695 for tomorrow. \n\nkey support- 3680 -&gt; 3586\n\nkey resistance- 3695 -&gt; 3745 -&gt; 3805\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qfppmqo1efu91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39fd41b7cd88c92c9916541faea4d439703fda51\n\nApple has a nice blue falling wedge forming and actually is holding its sideways channel of 138 to 142.4. I will be looking at the falling wedge and key levels of that channel before I decide which way markets going to go. For a lot of today it seemed like once again Apple looked weak while the general markets were propping everything up. \n\nLooking at the last 3 days of price action on Apple it actually does appear to be forming a daily bear flag. \n\nKey support- 138 -&gt; 134.9\n\nKey resistance- 142.5 (blue falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 144.3 -&gt; 146 (black bear channel)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8s5guh52efu91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39effdf2d2f91fe0e9a13d5e301fe61b325e8efb\n\nTesla is one that I struggle with. So looking at its chart Friday we had a massive full on bearishly engulfing candle. That SHOULD have led to further downside on Tesla today. However, it put in a pretty massive green inside day. The thoughts would be this was a relief bounce that did reject the daily 8ema and still is holding under black bear channel resistance. With earnings this week we could see Tesla move outside of the technical. \n\nKey support- 215 -&gt; 205 -&gt; 196.1\n\nKey resistance- 220 (black bear channel resistance) -&gt; 224.4 -&gt; 233.7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lod1gpo2efu91.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55031d951d65d3cb81a296dfdd965d0c32bdbf2d\n\nDespite all these media narrative or fed pausing and bullish rally to SPX 4000… until the VIX breaks through this bull channel its in which is bounced off support of today I will not be playing calls.

We once again saw a massive fight happening at 368.7 today and we did end up barely closing below it. As I was saying above 368 and until 378 is broken I would be looking for downside to retest that 356 to 360 area. 360 remains my next target and with Tesla missing earnings we should see that happen tomorrow or the next day. \n\nKey support- 363.9 -&gt; 359.9 -&gt; 356.5\n\nKey resistance- 371 -&gt; 375.2 -&gt; 378.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akiqrx5yvuu91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de48f4847f1df6746be071959dea8642153a4ed\n\nTaking a look at futures here we can see a break through of the V bottom support and as of now we are rejecting that daily 20ema level. Overall I am seeing continued evidence of downside. The one thing I do want to see in order to believe in a retest of that 3585 level is that we break through and close below 3680 support tomorrow. That was a key bounce area today and a key previous resistance level. \n\nSupport- 3680 -&gt; 3586\n\nResistance- 3760 -&gt; 3805\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3vvezkyvuu91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d940d05fbfbbfd2f28b20383894c367d218a52b\n\nApple overall doesn’t look terrible, but we saw once again a rejection of that key 143.8 level today and we saw a retest and rejection of the daily 20ema which should lead to more downside. \n\nWith Tesla missing on earnings due to a beat of expectations but revenue short fall (I wish I could listened to the call to see what he had to say) I do wonder with Apples report of Iphone 14 production cut and now this tesla earnings if we see that trickle down to the rest of tech who reports next week. \n\nKey support- 141.6 -&gt; 138.2 -&gt; 135\n\nKey resistance- 143.8 -&gt; 146.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7txp5t0zvuu91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1431ed8bcf41b0dcf8b3ec448fddf15dd9870e31\n\nI had been saying pretty much all week that I expected tesla COULD beat earnings but give poor guidance which would result in a sell off and well that’s pretty much exactly what happened today. I was actually even more bearish on earnings today seeing yesterdays massive rejection followed by the daily 8ema rejection… its funny how the markets “know” when to not go too bullish ahead of time…\n\nI will be watching key 205 support the most tomorrow and the rest of this week.

The biggest thing I am noting is that the fear in the markets is not unwinding. To me that means we are not quite read for the next wave up. \n\nI zoomed out a little bit so we could look back at the June bottom. If you see there is quite the difference between the two times. Once that June 16th 52 week low was in the VIX had already “peaked” and already was on its descent down. The touch of the VIX on June 16th had a huge wick and after that it was a straight sell off. \n\nThe biggest difference is that on the current VIX trend is that we put a new low in on October 13th and about 1 or 2 days before that we “peaked” however we are not seeing the same level of sell off now that we did then. And the overall downward resistance line from that peak was broken today. \n\nThe VIX is still holding that 20ema support and we are still in that danger zone of 28.4 to 33. I struggle to be truly bullish that the “bottom” is in and that we are going on a big rally until I see the vix break through that 28.4 support range. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnkx3kz0wuu91.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cfb90c112983a7c0f11f63aac0538642e756940\n\nOverall actually kind of a tough day to trade today. The biggest issue of the day was the IV and IV rank was so high from the previous day that the movements yesterday that were paying out an east 10-25% gains were barely paying 5% before it turned against you. It actually was very interesting to see how the premiums were moving today. \n\nA few times I noted in one specific Call play I was in that the price of SPY had fallen and fallen a decent amount where I definitely should have had my 20% stop loss hit, however, with the drop in SPY my call actually rose in value. Then once SPY did bounce my actual premium barely increased in value. It was almost like the actual movement of premiums was happening before the actual movement of SPY happened. I definitely caught a few plays where the technical setup of them looked perfect, however, caught a rogue bounce that stopped me out before I was able to capitalize. Overall a green day so no complaints but definitely a tough day to trade today. \n\nYoutube will be up soon!', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'who is right.

I mentioned that big run up we just had looked a lot like October 3rd and 4th. If that is true (which I do believe) then today was October 6th and we should push down from here. \n\nI am looking for a retest by next week of 356-360 support. If that support breaks then we could be looking for a new 52 week low. \n\nKeep in mind that next week is the week before FOMC meeting and generally speaking 5 out of the last 6 weeks before FOMC have been red averaging a -3% to -5% drop. \n\nKey support- 364 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.5\n\nKey resistance- 368.2 -&gt; 371.1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jjbx8knr0v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d824b7a75efa1107088aab23d83c044f78063d92\n\nFutures lost that key 3680 support I was talking about and looks to be closing back under it and under the daily 8ema just like SPY did today.

Apple put in a really massive gravestone doji today just like Spy did. This candle should be a reversal candle and should lead to a downside test. I do expect a test of at least 138.2 by end of next week. \n\nKey support -141.7 -&gt; 138.2\n\nKey resistance- 143.9 -&gt; 146.5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7qzqicuor0v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09ca3d7f43e99b58e7a0ea15f65179026b8d9277\n\nTesla has been on an absolute wild sell off for the last month with no end in sight. We found support at that 205 range today bouncing off of it twice today. I was actually a little impressed to see Tesla bounce how it did this morning as I really thought we might just breach through 200 today. However it looks like after putting a new 52 week low in today that we will have to wait and see where it goes. Overall I am bearish on Tesla and I am looking for 170-180 by end of next week also. \n\nSupport- 205 -&gt; 195.9 -&gt; 176.3\n\nResistance- 215.2 -&gt; 223.3 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ttsy3pdqr0v91.png?width=614&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e763fc5011d57862406f6c1a327980d299890c0b\n\nHonestly the VIX is telling a mixed story here. It doesn’t quite want to sell off, however it doesn’t quite want to rip up either. Today we saw spy close almost -1% and yet the VIX actually unwound slightly. \n\nI am still holding bearish until that key 28.4 level is broken. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a great day for me.

From the lowest point to the highest point SPY moved $12.3 up. \n\nSo where does that leave us? \n\nWell lets take a look at a few MACRO things first here. Next week is the week before FOMC (November 2nd). Now generally if we look at the previous FOMCS 5 out of the 6 last pre-FOMC weeks finished green averaging about a -4.41% drop. However, if we look at July you can see it was the only week where SPY finished green all year. What was the difference? Well that was back when they started the fed pivot/ inflation is getting better narrative. So I ask myself… are we in a inflation sucks, feds never going to stop hiking environment OR are we in an inflation is peaking and feds going to slow the big hikes soon? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kk87uy7kx8v91.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a94673e0a2e47b5b9c4b87eaff0ee8dd55d1a0fc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zsbgobnkx8v91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=277d33fd37be5015be893e3316b2496ed9eeca01\n\nNow I don’t like to include so many tweets in my TA but I find these to be VERY important. So lets break this down here… Next week is the week before FOMC. November 2nd will be FOMC. Followed by the next CPI reading the following week on November 10th. \n\nSo what does that mean. Today Bullard and Daly pretty much said without saying it and the WSJ article said that the fed is most likely going to do a 75bps hike on November 2nd. Once that hike is done in order to not over due it with rate hikes and cause a market crash/ collapse the economy they are most likely going to “pullback” to a 25 or 50bps hike. While this is NOT a pause what this is… is a clear slowing of rate hikes from the mouths of the fed themselves. This is one of the first times we have actually heard them discuss slowing or a lesser rate hike. \n\nWhy is this all important and how does it effect next week? Well the fed is now in a quiet period. What does that mean? That means no fed member can speak publicly to the press or say anything else until FOMC happens. They just left us with some extreme bullish news (even more bullish then when we rallied back in July-August). \n\nMy thoughts are this… next week we rally on this news and expectations of a 75bps hike followed by a 25-50bps hike in December. The week of FOMC we rally when JPOW confirms this news. Then this is when it gets tricky (and I don’t have the CPI consensus numbers yet to give an accurate probability of what CPI will be) but there is a chance that CPI will miss again and even if it does miss there is a chance that we will see markets rally instead of dropping just like the Septembers. Why? Because markets know that even if the CPI is bad the FED is going to slow its rate hikes. So unless JPOW says something different on November 2nd I would be bullish for the new two weeks minimum. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f10r8v8lx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7f26976211a045eb719eec49e35106c1abb6c76\n\nLooking at the SPY daily chart we actually have a really nice W pattern forming. What I am seeing is that today should have been our chance to retest the lower lows of the 350s however we rallied instead. With this daily candle being a two day (almost 3 day) bullishly engulfing candle with a double bottom off 365.1 from here I would expect upside. We have been trading in this grey channel for a full month now. The key resistance for this channel lies at 378.2 and the overall bear channel (blue dotted line) resistance from the August top lies at 378.8 from Monday. If we break through and close over those levels then in the next week or two we should look for a retest of the 390 level. However, if we reject that 378.2 level then I would be looking for us to maintain this grey channel and puts would be the most probable play. \n\nDaily supports- 370.5 -&gt; 365.2 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.5\n\nDaily resistance- 374.3 -&gt; 378.2 -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3pnjfrlx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f25e7a576acef7ddb04be2a5633f5e7a3d157a\n\nOn the SPY weekly we have a very V double bottom forming and we closed back over the weekly 200ema for the first time in a month. However we did fall just short of breaking through and closing over the daily 8ema. While we are still in this black bear channel right now that dates back to August. If SPY breaks through 374.3 at any point Monday or next week we will be through the bear channel resistance and that will open up the upside with a target of 382 to 385. \n\nWeekly support- 363.7 -&gt; 357 -&gt; 348\n\nWeekly resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 385.4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evp2th8mx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc610633efcb8e289e157c95617f47def49ba5f0\n\nAs you can see I am long on calls for SPY next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yavut9omx8v91.png?width=869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e66ea6cab114266ae34c640db81437e25909e457\n\nLooking at the futures daily chart I feel like the overall V bottom is even more clear. This was a fairly bullish close as the futures daily candle not only backtested and held support at 3675 to form a double bottom it also fully bull engulfed the previous 3 trading days and closed over key resistance of 3760. \n\nFutures will look to target 3880 next week as the next major daily resistance level. \n\nDaily support- 3708 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3586\n\nDaily resistance- 3775 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3875\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4rqz3e3nx8v91.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24227808bd4253b49b04bd19dab5a1dce3a2ef9f\n\nFutures weekly also has a nice V bottom but more notable had a major support area now at 3590 that has been held for 4 weeks in a row now. Futures weekly too closed over the weekly 200ema ofr the first time in a month but did fall short of breaking through its bear channel resistance and daily 8ema. However, unless we see futures Monday open down below 3690 (-2%+ red open) and hold that level all week we will see the futures weekly pattern broken through. This will open up the upside to retest the next resistance level at 3900 which notably is just over the JPM collar of 3870. \n\nWeekly support- 3705 -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3500\n\nWeekly resistance- 3775 -&gt; 3890\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ql9j2dhnx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0273ab8cff0593e5e078a14dfa8ff47f1494852f\n\nOn Apples daily I had called out earlier in the week that Apple was through its August bear channel resistance. However, as soon as it poked through it sold off. I was bearish based on that sell off, however, Apple has found some heavy support on its daily 8ema and at this point has broken through 145.4 resistance and wicked over the next major resistance of 147.5. With a close over the daily 20ema for the first time since September (SPY also closed over its daily 20ema) this is a pretty bullish sign moving forward. \n\nI will be watching that key red v bottom support very closely next week. The next major resistance level to break on the daily is 149.3.\n\nDaily support- 145.5 -&gt; 142.9 -&gt; 141 -&gt; 138.2\n\nDaily resistance- 147.6 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 150.7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6c64c2ox8v91.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c77e13dbdbf41d5b946cf6cbe2207ac51bb87a\n\nThe Apple weekly bear channel has also not been broken yet. However, with 3 week strong support put in at that key 138.2 support level and a nice v bottom support bounce… Apple was able to close over its weekly 8ema for the first time since the week of August 22nd. I will be looking for apple to test that bear channel resistance and break through it next week. Much like SPY unless Apple opens and holds red below 147.3 all week it will take out that bear channel resistance and open the upside. \n\nApple posts earnings on October 27th also to keep in mind. \n\nWeekly support- 141.2 -&gt; 138.2 -&gt; 133.4\n\nWeekly resistance- 147.3 -&gt; 150.5 -&gt; 155.9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0kbrcujox8v91.png?width=552&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aeb78b8ff9ef5fe943243c9d8d5a24ffde653df\n\nMuch like SPY I am bullish for Apple and i am expecting an upside move for Apple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nifh1ryox8v91.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a79cb66b90777a5de72bf67c8743e03ca0eb669\n\nNow Tesla is the wild child of the bunch. I actually had even mentioned in my TA yesterday that I almost was convinced of buying longer DTE calls on tesla because of how hard it bounced and how well it held that 205 support area. Well today reconfirmed my bullish suspicions. I am looking for Tesla to break through that bear channel Monday and see a bigger push up. After putting its 52week low in this week and being absolutely beaten down for the last month straight… Tesla is poised for a big bounce if the markets bounce. \n\nDaily support- 206.3 -&gt; 196\n\nDaily resistance- 215 -&gt; 223 -&gt; 233.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ib64rdpx8v91.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd4b0e0c7e534d1569063b6d899f4cee89d1b673\n\nTesla weekly finally for the first time in 5 weeks broke its resistance line. With a nice bounce off 205 I am looking for a bigger push up. While this is not a true double bottom I am looking for that 205 support level to hold. There is always a chance we could retest it early next week but I believe Tesla will seek upside from here as long as the rest of the market is doing the same. \n\nTesla has a pretty big no mans land from 223 to 255 area. After the May/ June low it spent a lot of time consolidating there before it finally pushed for the 300s. I would expect tesla to attempt to close somewhere inside that range next week. \n\nWeekly support- 205 -&gt; 191.9 -&gt; 167.8 \n\nWeekly resistance- 223 -&gt; 254.7 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0aiog7ypx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6393e383943329d759e51de47f46f93001338a9c\n\nAs you can see with SPY, Apple and Tesla I am attempting to add some Level to Level plays (as I call them) into my trading. I have been absolutely killing it with scalps lately but I see an opportunity as of late to enter some longer DTE plays and play these key level breakouts and break downs. I look forward to incorporating them as time goes on, but also recognizing that not every day or week will have level to level play. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utnevgarx8v91.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a23b9e30200aa2d37b14423cc4ab7d006ba8f3\n\nAnd then there was the VIX. Now you would think with SPY moving $12+ from pre market to HOD and having a nearly 2.5% green day that we would see the VIX massively unwind right? Well you would be wrong. The craziest thing is that as SPY rose the 2nd half of the day the VIX actually rose with it. Now I have said this numerous times but I really just don’t believe the VIX anymore. However, the key takeaway is we close below the daily 8ema and below the daily 20ema for the first time since middle of September. However, we did not lose the bull channel support just yet. This is the last piece to the bullish puzzle. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall a pretty good day for me today and a pretty great week overall. Not my best win rate by far but overall $$ and % gains was great this week. \n\nAs I was saying below is an example of some of the LEVEL to LEVEL plays I am going to start incorporating into my own trading that I hope allows me outside of my scalps to capture more gains and more moves. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9eyqekrrx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=366047c13cd275ca70ba07fbf88bb39d8cc70822\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/58p5l69sx8v91.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=471cf2b440a6a23a039250fd4d897a4cc378adb9\n\nOverall no complaints from this week!

The yen rose after reports that Japan may have intervened once more to support the currency.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nIt's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n&gt;**\\[12:10 ET\\]** Japan intervenes in the FX market to support the yen - Nikkei.  \n**\\[11:56 ET\\]** Fed's Daly: We will do a step-down, not to pause, but to 50 or 25 BPS increments.  \n**\\[11:48 ET\\]** Fed's Daly: According to projections, policy will be tightened to 4.5%-5% next year.  \n**\\[08:52 ET\\]** Fed set to raise rates by 0.75 point and debate the size of future hikes - WSJ.\xa0\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ko57t91jdv91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b50a1caca38ecaa66ed3d0d2ad7515a1775adb1\n\n# Earnings\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dar0im4jdv91.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755ac7086cefaa29f543c207b0928c7b77164296\n\n# 🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA\n\nFib.

The selling prices right now are &gt;$2200, above the $1600 MSRP and are currently unavailable for purchase anywhere for less than $2200. Furthermore from source [1], the 4090 was retailing at around $2000 US in the Asian markets but since launch, the price has started to hike up and currently sits at around $3000 US. At the same time, the demand for NVIDIA's H100 GPUs has shot up due to the upcoming China ban. The H100 PCIe accelerator which was available for $11,000 US is now selling for over $33,000$. The SXM version of the same GPU sells for even more but is much harder to come by. \n\nAlthough NVIDIA has suspended sales of their high-end AI GPUs in China, they have up till September 2023 to fulfill all current orders. Nvidia says that they are applying for export licenses for non-military use in China. The NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs can also be supplied through Hong Kong before 1st September 2023 so it looks like there's at least 1 year of time given to customers to finalize their orders with NVIDIA. Nvidia said it had booked $400 million in sales (~10% of total datacenter sales from China) of the affected chips this quarter to China that could be lost if firms decide not to buy alternative Nvidia products. It said it plans to apply for exemptions to the rule.\n\n&gt;If GPU prices go up however, this potential lost booking might not be as bad as people think. It could actually prove to be a tailwind.\n\n&gt;People also don't realize that the 4090 absolutely destroys AI workloads (just not to the same scale as H100 due to the lack of NVlink) from [3]. I suspect a chunk of AI chip demand will come from mid-scale enterprise (not hyperscalers) scooping up 4090s going forward after the Sept 2023 ban. \n\nNVIDIA Clean Sweeps MLPerf AI Benchmarks With Hopper H100 GPU, Up To 4.5x Performance Uplift Over Ampere A100. Biren [2] chips were a strong competitor of Ampere but now they are banned from using any advanced node unless they get export licenses. Where will China get their AI chips after Sept 2023? This will make GPU prices incredibly elevated for at least the next year. \n\nThere are geopolitical risks but these risks are in some ways good for Nvidia in the long term. The upcoming recession is causing trouble for AI chip companies as this industry is very winner-takes-all (ask AMD). The china ban got rid of Nvidia's main competition from Biren and Huawei. I was bearish on Nvidia short term due to China, but after the recent hot 4090 and H100 demand and the 4090 benchmarks, I am bullish on NVDA. \n\n[1] https://wccftech.com/nvidia-allegedly-shifts-geforce-rtx-4090-gaming-gpu-production-to-hopper-h100-ai-gpus/\n\n[2] https://wccftech.com/china-biren-gpus-cant-be-made-at-tsmc-due-to-us-regulations-competition-with-nvidia/\n\n[3]  https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/NVIDIA-RTX4090-ML-AI-and-Scientific-Computing-Performance-Preliminary-2382/", 'label': 1}, {'text': 'To the dude who’s quitting his job when his OTM short-dated SPY puts ‘print’ on Monday.', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Not bad for a quick hold on TSLA', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Is market bouncing off the bottom $SPY', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Me after dropping 50k on weekly TSLA calls', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'spy FDs looking kinda thicc 🥵', 'label': 1}, {'text': "Apple Earnings (AAPL): A Sensible DiscussionSup Ladies and Gentleman, and all you other degenerates.  I would like to discuss the even that is this Thursday: Apple Earnings.  I know nothing about the company products really which is why I've tagged it a discussion.  I am not some neckbeard fanboy who has such a poor understanding of technology, he has to get a baby proofed computer with an outrageous monitor stand,  nor am I a yuppie wanna-be artist with my head stuck up my ass sitting at a coffee shop waiting for someone to compliment the apple logo on my devices and clothes.  Personally, I am bearish.  Personally, I am an idiot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR\n\nI'm going to live up to my username and put the TL;DR in the beginning for you because I sense your concentration already drifting:  \n\n1. AAPL is important because it is a Colossus (get it?) of the Tech industry.  It will influence other holdings, and we should discuss and prepare.\n2. AAPL has held up remarkably through this crash.  Tim Apple is lending out his Apple-Bottom to all of Wall Street is my guess.  **This means Apple has a lot of room to fall like a final sacrifice to the bear God.**  \n3. Chip problems from China.  Biden administration is forcing a brain drain out of China and manufactured chips and production are in big fucking trouble. \n4. Stagnant growth and peaked design.  This is gonna upset people, but there really is so many times you can resize a box for a pocket and call it a fresh new product.  The hardware is getting ever so faster, but the innovation is gone. \n5. Flood of existing pre-used products already on the market.  \n6. American population is cutting back on expenses, and apple products are so overpriced for what they do. \n7. (Hoping to add more as good points come in)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# 1.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[See Biggest Square](https://preview.redd.it/5y2tsbc7mlv91.png?width=1354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=503fc2604fa460ae6af4d47b04f88ee261dd24c9)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2. Apple Still Hasn't Fallen Off the Tree\n\nOn my 1Y chart on Robinhood it says:\n\n* Apple down 1.41%\n* Microsoft down 21.94%\n* SPY down 17.13%\n* Amazon down 29.93%\n* Google down 27.26%\n* Snapchat down 86.93%\n* Bitcoyne down 67.9%\n* Silver down 21.16%\n* My portfolio down 69.69%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is some historical reference going all the way back pre-covid:\n\n| Announcement Date|Fiscal Quarter End|Estimated EPS|Actual EPS |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| 10/27/2022 ||$1.25|$????|\n| 2022-07-28 | 2022-06-30 | $1.14| $1.20 |\n| 2022-04-28|2022-03-31 | $1.43 | $1.52 |\n| 2022-01-27|2021-12-31 | $1.89 | $2.10 |\n| 2021-10-28 | 2021-09-30 | $1.24 | $1.24 |\n| 2021-07-27 | 2021-06-30 | $1.00 | $1.30 |\n| 2021-04-28 | 2021-03-31 | $1.00 | $1.40 |\n| 2021-01-27|2020-12-31|$1.41 |$1.68|\n| 2020-10-29 | 2020-09-30 | $0.69 | $0.73 |\n| 2020-07-30 | 2020-06-30 | $0.51 | $0.65 |\n| 2020-04-30 | 2020-03-31 | $0.52 | $0.64 |\n\nYou see, even despite a pandemic, they have always beat or matched their price target.  Covid was a strain on the market because of the forward thinking schizophrenic hive-mind that is traders.  They foresaw massive supply chain disruption and it is definitely here.  It is miraculous that we haven't seen more problems arising from Apple yet.  The new iPhone was announced as being delayed and stock quickly dropped and recovered.  Could this be signs of something yet to come?  Supply-chains are slow to rebuild.  Remember that.  It's been years, and the effects are being felt still.  Which brings me to my next point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. Chips\n\nNot sure what computers have to do with potatoes, but we are dealing with a bag of Lays right now.  You know how you buy a bag in line at the store, and then you open it and there is like 6 chips and air?  We are in a chip shortage and it is affecting everything.  I'll leave most of this discussion to the comments because the severity of what is going on needs to be mulled over. I can't help but think this is catastrophic.  Someone correct me. Please.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4, 5, and 6.\n\nThe remainder of my points are basically general recession points and Apple really isn't in a great place for a downturn. They sell unaffordable shiny and chrome items as a forefront of technological advancement, and people chase that clout with a fervor of excitement and pay a premium for it.  Well, buying new tech is a hobby. An expensive one.  As the strain tightens, the products already in circulation will be bought and replaced with other products as the collectors dump their phones into the market.  Similar to NVidias video cards when mining with GPU's was made obsolete.

As you can see, in 2021, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 64 cents was going to costs. In 2022, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 80 cents is going to cost. We're seeing a 45.66% decline in operating income. Also they are paying 21.18% in taxes which we will use later in our picture 4 calculation.\n\n[Meta analysis 2](https://imgur.com/Qk325WQ)\n\nIn the 2021 quarter, eps came in at 3.22 and in the 2022 quarter, eps came in at 1.64. That is essentially a 49% drop. If we're looking at diluted shares outstanding, the number declined by 6% meaning they are outpacing stock based compensation with their buyback program. Their total share based comp expense has increased 31.74% which is understandable given they are growing a new revenue segment\n\n[Meta Analysis 3](https://imgur.com/IUKfISN)\n\nThe information here shows the revenue segments and as we can see, from the 2021 quarter to the 2022 quarter, reality labs revenue dropped by 48.92% and the family of apps revenue dropped by 3.6%. Given that reality labs is the segment they are pouring money into, this is highly unwelcoming news. This quarters loss on the reality labs segment also came in significantly higher and compared to 2021 quarter, was 39.57% higher.\n\n[Meta Analysis 4](https://imgur.com/GAb3pG9)\n\nNow if we remove reality labs, EPS would come in around 2.71 versus the 1.64 we got.

A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\\_spy\\_next\\_9\\_days/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\\_spy\\_week\\_of\\_oct\\_17th/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  \n\nLets review the chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08\n\nA few points to note, the "**oversold we are too bearish" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. \n\nEquities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.\n\nWhat did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. \n\nWhat about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn\'t as hot, but it wasn\'t cool enough. \n\nIs the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. \n\nWhat about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn\'t. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. \n\nWill POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don\'t think so. He was able to stand Trump\'s tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn\'t worried about job security,** he wants to be "the man" to solve this problem. \n\n**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. \n\nDid Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can\'t save the market single handedly.** \n\nDid the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn\'t. \n\nIs the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don\'t have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. \n\nWhy did we rally? **Historic put buying was "closed" and historic "bearishness" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** \n\n**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. \n\nFor some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** \n\nCounter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   \n\n\n**How to Trade It:**  \n\n\n* With the VIX "relatively low" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. \n* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It\'s going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. \n* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.\n* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. \n* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. \n* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a "free" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. \n\nWhat other macro trends do you think I missed? \n\nPS. if you don\'t want to short the market, short TSLA.

What a frightfully boring day today was… This honestly was one of the worst choppy range days I have seen in months. The total range for today on SPY was $3.14… usually we see that level of movement on the opening candle of SPY. \n\nThe question remains where are we headed? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sja1wwyjn7x91.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5af9d65c426d9ec3063ba7bd36ef14e1c078159a\n\nThank you to u/80hz14 for posting this in the chat today… as you can see we have a few possible scenarios and outcomes for Wednesdays FOMC meeting. Overall I would say I am in the 75bps hike and a dovish presser where jpow hints at a 50bps in December. I think we should see a 3%+ green day on Wednesday. I would be pretty shocked with rising inflation to see JPOW drop a 50bps but honestly it could happen for other reasons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4h1f3nekn7x91.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dce38d2bc2709e6acc983596099c37400eacd16\n\nToday we saw an extreme small range day (only 39% of the 10 day average) inside day that closed as a gravestone doji. With 388.6 remaining as resistance I will be looking for downside until SPY can break free and close over that resistance level. Today we did see that the 386/ 3880 level on futures was impressively strong support. Any time SPY came anywhere near that we would see a pretty impressive pop. \n\nOvernight and tomorrow those will be our clear “breakout/ down” levels. From there it depends on which way markets want take us. We very well could end up with an equally as annoying range day tomorrow. However, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a small pullback tomorrow down to the 380 range. The last few FOMCs the two days leading up to it have provided a small pullback. \n\nKey support- 385 -&gt; 380.1 -&gt; 378\n\nKey resistance- 388.6 -&gt; 390.2 -&gt; 393\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rf02w4xkn7x91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2a2012870dd57f88567609213c8e4d44becf9be\n\nFutures also had an extremely choppy overnight and intraday today. However, its daily char is closing with a double top right at 3910 and just under the daily 100ema resistance of 3925. With holding that key support of 3770 all day today we will look to those two key levels tomorrow to guide us on what direction we are going to be headed tomorrow. \n\nIts not impossible to believe that markets could rally tomorrow with hopeful whispers of FOMC on Wednesday but the historical trend would point to slight downside (risk off) leading into FOMC.\n\nKey support- 3870 -&gt; 3845 -&gt; 3800\n\nKey resistance- 3925 -&gt; 3975\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75s55sbln7x91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3186b6392b9fa2609251fc6f6fd378f4bd58f162\n\nNot much of a surprise after that’s unbelievable Friday that Apple had we had a pretty nice pullback on Apple, although it looks more impressive than it actually was being that Apple only closed down 1.54%. \n\nApple is at a key level right here fighting between the daily 200ema of 153.4 and the daily 100ema of 152.2. Historically when it comes to Apple interacting with the 200ema it is a fight that lasts for a few trading days as the daily 200ema on Apple is a major major pivot point. I have not seen too many times where it takes a straight trend line down or up over the daily 200ema. \n\nKey support- 151 -&gt; 148\n\nKey resistance- 153.4 -&gt; 155.8 -&gt; 157.4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mihozrtln7x91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=546ac9f63d50ed5dcbf5e669ff51ff97c092a9cb\n\nTesla remains a tricky one to get a good read on, however, as you can see we are maintaining a pretty consistent red sideways consolidation channel from 205 to 230. We have now see our 4th day in a row of Tesla rejecting the daily 20ema and refusing to close over it. However, this is now the 4th day in a row that it has closed over the daily 8ema. As you can see we are in a pretty impressive red bull channel here, however, that blue resistance and red support lines are forming a really nice rising wedge. \n\nUntil Tesla can breakout and most importantly close over the daily 20ema I remain bearish on it. My anticipation would be that we see a move one way or another tomorrow. Key support for that red bull channel is 224.8 tomorrow which is also the 3 day support line and previous resistance line. While its not impossible I would be surprised to see Tesla hold between 230 resistance 224.8 support. \n\nKey support- 224.8 -&gt; 219.3\n\nKey resistance- 230 -&gt; 234.2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0cs5dknn7x91.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c4529f0d2b4bf1e2a3ff680a5474bea171c579\n\nYou gotta love the VIX this thing just defies all logic. I am actually surprised with FOMC in two days to see the VIX unwind more like it did today, however, the VIX actually had a really impressive spike at open and closed down with a nice inside day… one of those odd days where the 10year yield, DXY and VIX were all red and SPY was red. \n\nSome of the issue I saw today was that over all price action, volume and momentum opened pretty bearish this morning, however, the VIX continued to unwind and I believe that led to a lot of this choppy tight range price action. The VIX is currently holding right at the same level it was prior to last FOMC where the day before fomc closed at a VIX of 27.15. \n\nOverall no real sense of direction for SPY tomorrow as until FOMC happens the market in my opinion is not going to play nicely and not play by the technicals. \n\nFOMC day is setting up to be a really nice day for some nice wins, I have posted that TA and trade plan/ analysis. Make sure you give it a read! \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a really tough day for me today. Actual scalp wise I did do fairly well today, however, I had my level to level calls from Friday that I should have closed the Tesla calls green this morning (regrets) and I actually ended up closing them pretty early this morning when pretty much everything pointed to downside… only for them to pop up right after I closed them. If it wasn’t for those two woulda been a decent day despite the hard price action. \n\nI also thing that’s something that is going to catch this market by surprise here very soon and possibly even tomorrow for pretty much the last week or two now the price action of SPY in the mornings has been pretty bearish and has also been support by volume too. However, by 11ish we have seen a complete snap of trend and 180 reversal… today just chopped instead of broke out. I wonder if we get a slight sell off tomorrow as people get caught thinking its time to buy the morning weakness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpvi8i5on7x91.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a2874c15f1667138319a8a6f0de51c94dc5841f\n\nClosing out my most profitable month of the year and also one that I do not plan to attempt to beat. Great month with some great plays. Keeping in mind that my average % gain per trade was still only 12.7% for the month. This wasn’t so much about getting random massive winners… though I had some nice wins in there too… it was more about consistent small gains that have added up over time and most importantly limiting downside risk with a -20% stop loss. \n\nI posted my article about that this weekend but something to keep in mind is that just because I use a -20% stop loss on my scalps doesn’t mean that is right for you. You have to find what works for your strategy and your overall profits/ trade. The whole theory is though that you can have an extremely successful strategy but if one loser wipes out all of your weeks profits or numerous days of profits then you need to manage your risk better. It’s a balancing act of having a lose enough stop to not stop out too quickly (especially on my level to level plays) BUT not having such a big stop loss that it hits and the loss takes numerous trades to overcome. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p9hkg8mon7x91.png?width=903&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bff9726a6c257cd9e638320a59dfb3e46b19b999\n\nMostly for my own records but I am going to starts separating my scalps and my level to level trades from eachother and this month of November I really wanna analyze the comparison of them and everything more closely. \n\nNo youtube tonight!

Spy put in what I would call a bullish day today and one that is hinting a further upside for tomorrow at least. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pv8feaxfrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b0e0f0a54553451549071a444463065cf7f3371\n\nDespite the struggle almost all day for SPY to break through 370 resistance we finally saw spy break through before power hour and end the day extremely bullish. The biggest bullish moves today was confirming the daily 20ema as support, closing over the daily 8ema support and closing back inside the green channel. The next step for bulls is to take our 380 resistance that held us up end of day and close over the 50ema. With the black rising wedge still in tact you can see my next target for SPY is that 388.5 to 390 level which I believe we could see before Wednesday EOD. \n\nHowever, tomorrow we have to see SPY break through 380 which is where that red resistance line for the pre fomc/ fomc sell off intersects. Once we break through that then this sell off from CPI is effectively over and we can look for some upside. However, if bears manage to hold us under 380 we could see a potential double top at 380 and look for a closure back under 378 which then would show signs of weakness for Wednesday. \n\nSupport- 378 -&gt; 376.2 -&gt; 374.7 -&gt; 371.4\n\nResistance- 380 -&gt; 384 -&gt; 388.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8megzjdgrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f4d22aad569cd1026ec839c93353a6f42c866b0\n\nFutures is holding within the blue rising wedge still also. It’s a little hard to tell but I highlighted in purple that key 3805 level which futures if finally going to close over (this is much like 378 for spy). With this closure it opens us up for the next key level of 3925. \n\nIf 3805 is lost and especially closed under again tomorrow then we will look for a retest of the mid to lower 3700s. \n\nKey support- 3805 -&gt; 3750 -&gt; 3675\n\nKey resistance- 3865 -&gt; 3925\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r69c3tugrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc1041bb2933bdcabaaf0768a85e94e06559ee8c\n\nApple despite looking extremely weak this morning on more china news managed to pull out a green day with a nice hanging man candle finish and still maintained a closure over 138.1 support. Though Apple barely scrapped by with a green day apple will look to test that steep red bear channel resistance tomorrow. If they can break through 139.9 resistance it should open up some more upside and possibly look to see that 145 gap fill. \n\nKey support- 138.1 -&gt; 137.1 -&gt; 135\n\nKey resistance- 142.1 -&gt; 145\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26c8fmahrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdf936215c353596806171a603932ab9f0750a87\n\nAnd then there was Tesla…. She giveth and she taketh just as fast. I mentioned that pretty massive diamond pattern that hard formed on tesla last week and we officially did break through the support line and now only that we broke all the way through the red sideways channel. I took a pretty big L on my tesla calls (shoulda closed for break even at open) today looking for a recoil off the lows like it has historically done. \n\nHighlighted by the 4 blue arrows here is the last 4 times a new low was put in. As you can see the following days resulted in pretty impressively green bounces. I am playing some calls for that historical bounce. With a new 52 week low put in and seemingly no catalyst for further dropping I like the odds of a bounce at least beast to reconfirm 205.6 as resistance. However, if we see further sell off tomorrow I will accept my loss on it. The 15min chart is forming a nice 197 double double bottom. \n\nKey support- 197 -&gt; 193.3 -&gt; 184.3\n\nKey resistance- 201.8 -&gt; 205.6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zngtnoqirly91.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9b10b3e5e7e7e1faf0e9381751d5f869fc9b603\n\nThe VIX seemingly continues to point to more upside to come. Which is actually fairly impressive considering CPI is in 3 days now. I would have expected to at least (though we did at open) see some fear being put back into the markets. However, we actually formed a bearish daily engulfing candle (bearish because its red but for SPY this would be bullish). We also continue to reject the daily 8ema on the VIX. I mentioned last week that premiums are very cheap for longer DTE right now but I believe you are way too early to be going long as the VIX hasn’t hinted at any sort of upside in weeks. Actually what is even more impressive of the last 20 trading days… the VIX has either closed red OR closed &lt;1% green. The fear in this market is gone right now. Which leads to me show this next chart. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfln1xilrly91.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e379545443901d6c0c50c5a1f720a6322505f6c6\n\nLooking at the fear and greed index… we are actually at the highest level of greed that we have been at since January of 2022. Which for those of you who forgot… from January 4th (about peak of the greed of 65) to January 27th (roughly the bottom of the greed index of 20) SPY fell from 479.98 to 420.76 or fell $59.22 and 12.4%. \n\nThe current FG index reading is 61. The January 4th peak was 65 before it dropped us to a fear of 20. The April peak hit 62 before it finally sold of and dropped us to the May 12th fear level of 3 (wow). August 12ths peak hit 68 before it dropped us to our September 30th low of 15.  \n\nJanuarys drop= 12.4% drop over 13 days  \n Aprils drop= 16.7% drop over 32 days  \n Augusts drop= 17.4% drop over 32 days  \n   \n \n\nThat would mean we COULD be gearing up for roughly a 15.5% drop over the next about 26 days… that would give us roughly a drive target (from todays close) of 321.06 by December 12th…. \n\nNow hear me out on this one which is even more WILD… December 12th is the next CPI reading (after this Thursday) and then FOMC is on December 13th (the day after)…. Is it possible that we are about to see a top put in this week and this CPI is about to start a slow bleed down to 320 over the next month? Its possible… \n\nSomething to consider for this CPI that is coming up here in 3 days now. I still favor as I said last week a green Monday and Tuesday (half way there) followed by either a green or red Wednesday which would most likely result in a nice inside day. Then Thursday is going to be a huge miss on CPI ( analysis was posted to the server on my trade plan). This huge CPI miss could have the weight to start the next leg down on SPY especially depending on what happens with the mid term elections this week. \n\nDaily log- \n\nToday was my first red day since I believe September 1st. Didn’t miss it by much but red nonetheless. I held my tesla call far too long and should have realized that loss much faster. I also had another break even attempt to exit it this morning and failed to take it… though I wouldn’t have pinned tesla for a new 52 week low today at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3mcji9mrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28b6552ea94c4714d5fce056b25a70f6405f6f37\n\nSomething important to keep in mind with red days is that we can not let a day be so red that it makes not only the day but the week red. For me despite the bigger loss this week easily will be a green week if I continue to trade well. Another thing that many traders make the mistake of doing is revenge trading. They see that red day and think dang it I really need to get green today let me force this trade or let me do XYZ and they end up turning a manageable red day into a unmanageable red week. \n\nThe best thing to do is start the day fresh. Every day is a new day and every week is a new week… every trade is a new chance… If you had a great win or a huge loss on your last trade, day or week we can not let that sway us or change or mechanics. \n\nSomething I am going to intertwine on my level to level plays is a -25% stop loss on all plays. If they play is done correctly then If it hits that red I was wrong and it wont really come back to life. Trading a longer DTE on these allows for plenty of movement before -25% ever happens. This was the struggle I always had with scalps before I set a mechanical stop loss was that I would marry my play.

Nov 10 was SPY\'s [biggest daily gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_S%26P_500_Index) since the COVID face-ripper in March 2020. We were only about $2.50 away from being the largest ever. \n\nI loaded up on 11/11 puts at the end of the day, and wanted to spend my evening alone in the dark, scouring the internet for copium. This search led me to look at how SPY typically performs the day after a face ripper. \n\nFor those who missed the link above, Wikipedia has the biggest daily percent and point gains laid out here:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_largest\\_daily\\_changes\\_in\\_the\\_S%26P\\_500\\_Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_S%26P_500_Index)\n\nI\'m going to ignore anything pre-1940, since SP500 data is a bit weird back there. Below, though, are the size of the gaps between the closing price on a Shrek-dick green day, and the intraday low on the following trading day:\n\nOct 13/14 2008 - Closed at 101.35 on Oct 13, Intraday low of 97.11 Oct 14. **Drop of 4.2%.**  \nOct 28/29 2008 - Closed at 93.76 on Oct 28, Intraday low of 92.10 Oct 29. **Drop of 1.8%.**  \nMay 24/25 2020 - Closed at 243.15 on May 24, Intraday low of 239.75 on May 25. **Drop of 1.4%.**  \nMay 13/16 2020 - Closed at 269.32 on May 13, Intraday low of 237.36 on May 16. **Drop of 11.9%.**\n\nThe above values are from the list of the biggest PERCENT increases in SP500 history. The average daily gain percent gain for these dates is about 10%, so it\'s possible that they aren\'t valid data points to get an idea for what might happen tomorrow. Thankfully, if we look at the biggest POINT gains in history (where Nov 10, 2022 ranks in third place), we might get a better idea. Also, this list has a lot more recent data. To try to maximize the validity of our data points, I will only include values that are associated with a daily gain of over 3%:\n\nApr 6/7 2020 - Closed at 264.86 on Apr 6, Intraday low of 264.89 on Apr 7. **RISE of 0.01%.**  \nMar 26/27 2020 - Closed at 261.20 on Mar 26, Intraday low of 251.05 Mar 27. **Drop of 3.9%.**  \nMar 17/18 2020 - Closed at 252.8 on Mar 17, Intraday low of 228.02 on Mar 18. **Drop of 9.8%.**  \nMar 2/3 2020 - Closed at 309.09 on Mar 2, Intraday low of 297.57 on Mar 3. **Drop of 3.7%.**  \nMar 10/11 2020 - Closed at 288.42 on Mar 10, Intraday low of 270.88 Mar 11. **Drop of 6.1%.**  \nMar 4/5 2020 - Closed at 312.86 on Mar 4, Intraday low of 300.01 on Mar 5. **Drop of 4.1%.**   \nDec 26/27 2018 - Closed at 246.18 on Dec 26, Intraday low of 238.96 on Dec 27. **Drop of 3.9%.**  \nOct 13/14 2008 - Closed at 101.35 on Oct 13, Intraday low of 97.11 on Oct 14. **Drop of 4.2%.**\n\nUsing the above dataset, we can see that **since the 1930s, after days of profound gains, the mean drop to the intraday low the following day is 4.58%, and the median drop is 4%**. \n\nAssuming that tomorrow experiences an average drop of 4%, we may see a SPY price as low as $378.82 intraday.

I have found with Tesla if I am correct its best to secure profits immediately at open and if im wrong its best to wait on the first 30 minutes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9jcq7c6td0a1.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4c31740316347f7ee9c2fe944e5a42856fc80c3\n\nLooking at Tesla daily today we now have yet again another falling wedge formed but more importantly than that we did break through that 5 day long blue support line. This should open up some more downside for Tesla here now. 187.66 is currently the weekly 200ema on tesla which we now are back under neath. I was watching this level very closely last week and as I had mentioned last week a closure under this should open up a lot more downside. \n\nKey support- 186.6 -&gt; 177.4\n\nResistance- 191.5 -&gt; 196.1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9q1bak7td0a1.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75cb067078cba54982c1c86806439f93a1929922\n\nThe VIX did a whole lot of nothing today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/15yqxem8td0a1.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9da0d03c03843bb9cfee7d56408dacd2c06b34e\n\nI don’t ever include a 15min chart on the VIX but I just had to show how flat it really was today. Between the bold vertical purple lines is the intraday open to close. The vix held an impressively tight $1.73 cent range all day long. Im not sure if people are still on edge about the Poland/ Russia stuff and are unwilling to take their put hedges off or if we have just reached a point where no one is putting downside protection on but the fear isn’t ready to continue to unwind out of the market. \n\nOverall though we are clearly still holding that 23.5 level where I struggle to be bullish shorter term/ longer term until we unwind under neath that. \n\n**$5k/ 10% Challenge-**\n\nOverall despite the untradeable chop was able to secure a nice win this morning on a SPX Put. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/03e66q19td0a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=893f6797010ce3e0901f6811aab0c620537314d7\n\n**Daily Log-** \n\nToday was a really tough day to trade and I got stopped out and stopped myself out a few times only to go green. I also was the lucky part for a few rogue candle spikes in my favor too. A green day but not my best day that’s for sure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gak12zi9td0a1.png?width=863&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1123fb381059f7cddd12fd5178469736008f9ff\n\nThis week has been pretty interesting for me. I haven’t really been doing it on purpose per say but I have found that I have take a major risk off on Scalps this week. I have only scalped a total of 9 times this whole week (about 3/ day). However, in the last month or so I have been averaging 5-10 scalps/ day. I also have seen a major uptick in my level to level plays now fronting about 8-10/ day when over the last month I have at best done 2-4 a day. \n\nOverall I would say win rate and profits have been consistent with this change. I still believe we are in a scalpers market but I have really been enjoying these level to level plays. While I find that humbly I am good at scalps and good at recognizing high probability set ups. IT has been a really nice change of pace to be able to open a play and let it play out without having to have my finger on sell the whole time and without being worried about one small pop stopping me out only for it to come back to my favor. \n\nSomething to keep in mind in my level to level plays and really in any strategy you deploy in this market is the risk to reward. I am not perfect and it would be practical to have a 100% win rate all the time… yes at times I have done it for short periods of times but its improbable to expect it. What we need to focus on is high probability and high risk to reward set ups. So this means we have to be willing to go into a position that COULD stop us out at out -20%. But the risk to reward and probability of green is high enough that the reward out weighs the risk. It is also important in this market to use stop losses. \n\nMost importantly though it is important to be mechanical in those stop losses. The second you remove that stop loss “to let it play out” you already loss. You loss because you broke your rules in an attempt of being smarter than the market. \n\nStay mechanical. Take the high probability plays. Don’t be afraid to take 3-5% if that means green. If you see it going against you… we don’t have to let it play all the way to the stop loss.   \n   \n \n\nYOUTUBE will be up later!', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Still alive, all or nothing on this one boys (NVDA ER YOLO)', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'Puts $meta[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': '11-15-22 SPY/ ES Futures, and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisGoing to shy away from further TA on Apple. For me personally I don’t focus on it much anymore and I just don’t want to waste my resources on it when I have had a much higher success rate with Tesla and of course my GOAT SPY. \n\nToday we saw yet again another massive sell off. I am trying to decide if markets are truly that over extended that anything will cause a dump or if we are just getting truly rogue new waves causing a dump. The one thing i will say is that as low as the VIX is right now… it sure shows signs it doesn’t want to stay there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfq05cbxt70a1.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bceb8d88dc64a122111ae099429909bfb085c4f\n\nThe one thing that did happen today that is important to note even before that huge dump with the Poland “incident” is that SPY had a massive pre market attempted to break out over the daily 200ema at open and then from there was stuck in a tight range and even before the Poland news broke it appeared we were looking at a bigger sell off EOD. \n\nNow SPY is faced with a nice daily 200ema attempt and rejection with a doji candle. So the question will be which should be answered tomorrow is… did we just put the top in with that 200ema rejection or did we just reject to gather further support before we push through this major resistance point? I still remain indifferent here as I did note that the VIX was pushing up this morning even before the Poland news drop. So it could be that at these levels people are finally starting to put some downside protection back on. However, I do still think its too early to go long on puts here but I also think its silly to be long on calls here also.\n\nSupport- 398.5 (key pivot point) -&gt; 395 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 390.1\n\nResistance- 401.9 -&gt; 405.3\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ra3egbrxt70a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4e21b3fd3ae31ab341e4c2ca95dd267553b9660\n\nLooking at futures daily compared to SPY daily there is quite a bit of a difference in the daily candle structure. On Futes we actually see a really large wicked double top at 4002 gravestone doji. This to me is set up as a far more bearish indication then SPY daily shows. \n\nFutures has struggled now 3 days in a row to break through 4002 and most importantly to close over it. This is our key pivot level. If futures can close over 4002 then I do forsee a case for 4100. However, IF we reject or fail to retest 4002 again then I am looking for support down 3900. The key support level is 3965. \n\nSupport- 3965 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3900\n\nResistance- 4002 -&gt; 4027 -&gt; 4060\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0neyc8yt70a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc52fdd5a93ed797457892c4d13fcb8a2e266bb3\n\nTesla had started out bullish in my opinion breaking through that falling wedge resistance and breaking over and holding over the daily 8ema for a while. I was actually bullish on Tesla thinking with this breakout we could see a run for the daily 20ema and possibly channel resistance at 208.8. However, we ended up loosing support and closing back under the daily 8ema. With the daily 8ema closed under I am seeing a very strong resistance at 196.1. Until this level is broken and the daily 8ema is closed over I do expect further downside or at minimum consolidation. \n\nSupport- 190.8 -&gt; 185.7 -&gt; 177.4\n\nResistance- 196.1 -&gt; 201 -&gt; 204.9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwd8stizt70a1.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74f97e505024fa967801a45662891d8c2a460ce8\n\nWe did see a pretty nice breakout of this bear channel today on the VIX. The thing I noted and mentioned earlier is that we saw the VIX was holding 23.5 and was actually pushing up even before the Poland new hit the markets. With the VIX options expiration tomorrow its very possible that is why we saw this movement up. Or as I had mentioned with spy at 400/ spx at 4000 range now I do wonder if we are seeing people put their downside hedges back on. I mean it doesn’t take a brainiac to realize we are STILL in a bear market and things STILL aren’t that great in the economy and realistically no one knows exactly what JPOW is going to do next month at FOMC. \n\nThere still is a very real scenario where JPOW says 50 bps hike and hints at another 50bps next meeting in January. On top of that there is nothing saying after 5 consecutive decreases on the CPI YoY readings that we don’t get a rogue spike in CPI YoY that sends the markets tumbling. At this point with the markets now expecting a beat on CPI any miss is going to get bloody… like historically bloody type of days…\n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t69kkk00u70a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8341e101162fcf735d9fe88cc69ad1529010dfb4\n\nGood day today. I was busy with my daughter and her birthday most of the morning so I wasn’t around to trade until about 1230… hit that morning put scalp on SPX before I left. I came back in right before that massive dump from the Poland news and got burnt on some calls off what looked like a support bounce. After that did a few quick level to level plays but on huge reactions like that I don’t enjoy trading much and I also don’t trade during power hour much anymore besides the occasional too good to be true lotto play. So I was mostly cash. Still a green day but small at that… \n\n**Daily Log-** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9uc4hpf0u70a1.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b52cd9c2c507d1b018c563ceb68dd7c068249e9d\n\nI am very curious to see what the market is going to open at tomorrow. I heard there COULD be an emergency meeting with NATO to discuss more Russia stuff. I don’t know if there will be any further action as the narrative im seeing pushed right now is that it was an accident OR it wasn’t even a missile… we probably will never know the truth. \n\nI did swing some Tesla OTM puts though based on that setup on the daily. I will take profits or take my loss at open pretty much regardless unless im seeing something different on my indicators/ the charts. \n\nThat’s the hardest part about swings is that I get a lot of questions before the market even opens of “are you going to take profits at open?” “you going to take your loss at open?” and honestly until the market opens and until I see exactly what VOLD is doing and the overall moneyflow/ momentum and the DMI stoch and just the actual movement of the candles I have no way to know exactly what the plan is. The only time I for sure can say yes I will close at open is when I know I have a substantial amount of profits OR the move I anticipated clearly isn’t about to play out. \n\nYOUTUBE be up later tonight!', 'label': 1}, {'text': "When my roommate asks me why I'm buying NVDA back at 160 after selling for a huge loss at 115", 'label': -1}, {'text': 'NVDA is expected to have close to 0% revenue growth from their FY 2022 to FY 2023', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'What price will $SPY close at on 11/23 the day before ThanksGiving?&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jnqzkwt0dk0a1.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e5dff450d6e99975a043263df94cc8afda6917d\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/yxzfdx)', 'label': -1}, {'text': '50k loss $SPY puts', 'label': -1}, {'text': '$TSLA 👑 Huge 1-Year inflection approaching 👑[removed]', 'label': -1}, {'text': '$Meta', 'label': -1}, {'text': 'puts on $NVDA', 'label': -1}, {'text': '$TSLA -55% in the past year.

Oil futures fell on indications that the market is currently oversupplied.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThe S&amp;P 500 index gained 0.5% on Friday to finish the week down 0.7%, while the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.2% in the previous five days. Trading volumes were low during Friday's $2.1 trillion options expiration, which is typically a day when volatility spikes as traders and dealers rebalance their large exposures.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nTreasury yields rose again on Thursday following hawkish remarks from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said interest rates needed to rise to at least 5%-5.25% to curb inflation.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Similarly, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari stated on Thursday that it is a open question how far the central bank needs to go with rates to bring demand back into balance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nContinuously rising interest rates are already putting pressure on global demand. Copper and Oil prices, which are sensitive to growth, were set to fall for the week due to concerns about a worsening outlook. For the first time in nearly a year, US Crude futures indicated an oversupply. Higher mortgage rates slowed sales of previously owned US homes for the ninth consecutive month in October.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nHowever, some equity investors believe that hawkish Fed commentary does not necessarily imply that rates will peak at higher levels than previously thought. And traders remain confident that the Fed will reverse course and begin cutting rates in late 2023.\n\n# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice\n\n* **\\[10:19 ET\\]** Fed's Collins: 75 basis points remain on the table.\n* **\\[10:18 ET\\]** Fed's Collins: Recent data has increased the upper bound of where I believe rates should be.\n* **\\[08:15 ET\\]**\xa0ECB's Knot: An earlier start to QT reduces the peak inflation, and the terminal rate.\n* **\\[08:00 ET\\]**\xa0ECB's Nagel: Recession is insufficient to get inflation back to target.\n* **\\[08:00 ET\\]** ECB's Nagel: We should start with QT at the beginning of 2023.\n\n# Economic Calendar\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nec5kqthvx0a1.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2c68c3eb6873bd31ecb4be7f886a948a0ee86b9\n\n# 🕵️\u200d♂️ I SPY TA - Monday November 21, 2022\n\nWeek of November 21 fluid expectation from option ai.\n\nWe are ABOVE the **20 MA (385.82)** and will be key for bulls to hold above next week.

Look at this years CPI YoY forecasts and actual readings. Since July 13th we have not had a single increase in CPI YoY. We have also not had a single CPI YoY forecast higher than the previous reading which is interesting. Now we look at CORE CPI YoY and from August until October core was rising, however, last reading core decreased again. \n\nSo we have the fed and mind you they’ve been saying “inflation is not under control” since at least July maybe August. But we are seeing inflation slowing… not necessarily decreasing which obviously is goal… but with CPI YoY decreasing and CORE ranging from 5.9 to 6.6% with most of it being 5.9 to 6.3% I feel like there I just something the fed isn’t telling us. Or perhaps the fed really is waiting for a big inflation rebound? I mean think about JPOW last FOMC what did he tell us? We was VERY clear that slowing rate hikes now would be extremely pre mature. Which means that almost all the fed members and even JPOW himself knows inflation isn’t under control. \n\nThis next CPI and FOMC meeting will be very interesting to say the least. The case for a huge CPI miss is growing by the minute for me. However, we don’t have any consensus yet (investing.com says forecast but that really the consensus…. There is a TEforecast out but I find that inaccurate). There is a case rising for these 390 to 405 levels to chop us until CPI and FOMC. Which then perhaps CPI misses and FOMC remains bearish and we see this drop hard. \n\nWednesday is FOMC minute day and we should get some more information from JPOW and what the fed members are thinking there. (I will release the FOMC minute trade play to the pre-market section tonight). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfrxzj5hpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=191381b89207ff63d8075f2910dae56ddf47af39\n\nLast week I brought you my theory that with the fear and greed index peaking at the previous levels that we could be seeing a top put in. However, we are still showing bullish enough moves here. To not short this. \n\nThe bull case here is that despite the morning dump and the volatility with rogue $2 drops today (that was interesting) we are still holding that daily 8ema. That support holding is bullish in and of itself and we are holding the lower end range of this consolidation channel from 394.7 to 398.5. Now mind you I really would like to see us make an actual attempt back at 398.5 and actually touch that resistance… but 5 of our last 7 trading days have closed inside that range. \n\nWe closed yet again another doji on spy too. I am eyeing a possible carrot top (blue lines) formed here with the point being that massive rejection at the daily 200ema. While we continue to hold the daily 100ema we have not showed any chance of retesting the daily 200ema since we hard rejected it. \n\nThe issue we have here is this… buyers recognize that we are in a bear market and we are not only near the 200ema but we are in the upper 25% of the bear market channel which means there is lower risk to reward for calls. While we very well could push up to 405 to 410 this month still before CPI/ FOMC I feel like no one wants to go long here on calls. However, sellers recognize that we could go higher here too and do not want to take a chance and short this early. \n\nBears aren’t ready to hard sell and bulls don’t want to keep buying. So we are left with this terrible chop. \n\nKey support- 394.7 -&gt; 390.1\n\nKey resistance-398.5 -&gt; 401.3 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/feysfrohpd1a1.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97068f6a4b52222fe178cb484f3dc4dbead51708\n\nFutures is about to close out its 7 doji in a row now on the daily chart. Futures continues to hold 3960 support and remains under 4000 resistance. Looking at futures I actually see a clearer trend than I do on SPY. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4woaa4ipd1a1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56818a1864ada48fd356d989717ecd5cbe37bdb6\n\nI removed some of my trend lines here to make this look more clear. There is a nice diamond pattern forming here on Futures. This pattern generally does lead to a big move up or a big move down. This pattern shows support at 3950 tomorrow and resistance at 4005. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4dh1vnipd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7488b50427a19e5bfa3253f3bf0b131cbce538fb\n\nOut of curiosity I went back to SPY and sure enough it has a diamond pattern too and perhaps and even more convincing one. Support at 394 and resistance at 397.8 for tomorrow. \n\nBack to futures now.   \n key support- 3960 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3910  \n key resistance- 4000 -&gt; 4028\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0sb8hq6jpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72da651ab80b0384fc70caa16103d40007d66d2f\n\nZooming out here first to show you the Tesla Daily and show you what lines goes where before we zoom in and chat about them. Focus on the bold dark green line here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hy86mnojpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5225f763631b55f413c3dd6bc3e2cb95122ac2fe\n\nNow looking at the zoomed in daily you can see that Tesla actually did break through the daily support line for the green bear channel. This green bear channel as you can see on the zoomed out daily is less extreme than the red bear channel. We are not inside of the red bear channel and that support is showing that the low 100s is possible in December. \n\nInterestingly enough about Tesla here is we have a red falling wedge, a red/ black falling wedge and a blue/ red falling wedge. Now People have been calling for a bounce since 204.8 and since the 234 rejection back on November 1st. \n\nThis is where I struggle as it just seems Tesla cant quite catch a break. Had a bad news day on Friday and then again today (recalls I guess). The question is will tesla ever bounce and if it does where will it go? Or is this the easiest short of 2022? \n\nI want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… \n\nSept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   \n Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  \n Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  \n Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  \n Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   \n Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  \n \n\nAverage # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  \n Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  \n Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  \n Average % for the pop= 11.81%  \n \n\nso what does this tell us? \n\nWell being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. \n\nThis also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. \n\nLooking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6ebxazkpd1a1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2a2eda88760c96bf81025455f1a886dc4b406f7\n\nThere was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… \n\nLets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. \n\nThat means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. \n\nTo be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wpi4leflpd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f9b70d177ac87572352e1dbb896d87c7b3dee7a\n\n**Daily Log-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddjqa6ylpd1a1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c9c19c0d6b703e697bb85085b2781da8363bacf\n\nReally tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. \n\nFrom there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. \n\nA red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. \n\nHOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… \n\nAnyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. \n\nPeople really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. \n\nLong story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them…. Do not be greedy!  \n \n\nYoutube will be up later!  \n \n\nReminder I will NOT be trading tomorrow so no pre-market tomorrow morning and I wont be trading at all tomorrow… busy day with the kids and some other appointments.', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'at what price does TSLA become tochtoig?[removed]', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Options possibilities (07/02/2021) AMZN 3500 call option chart (left) compared to Amazon stock chart (right) 2.12% gain creates 46500% gain', 'label': 1}, {'text': '11-21-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisThat was probably one of the worst days to trade that I have seen in months.

Or is this the easiest short of 2022? \n\nI want to look at some trends on Tesla as I like numbers so lets go back to the September 21st top… \n\nSept 21st= 5 day drop -13.83% followed by 2 day pop 6.85%   \n Sept 28th= 5 day drop -16.6% followed by 1 day pop of 6.9%  \n Oct 4th= 10 day drop -20.7% followed by 4 day pop of 12.6%  \n Oct 18th= 6 day drop -13.2% followed by 8 day pop of 19.4%  \n Nov 1st= 8 day drop -25.4% followed by 6 day pop of 13.3%   \n Nov 15th (current drop)= 6 day drop -16.6% followed by a ????  \n \n\nAverage # of days for the drop= 6.66 days (including current drop… or 6.8 without current drop)  \n Average % for the drop= -17.7% (including current drop… or 17.94% without current drop)  \n Average # of days for the pop= 4.2 days  \n Average % for the pop= 11.81%  \n \n\nso what does this tell us? \n\nWell being that today was officially the 6th day of this current drop and we are about 1.1% from the average drop there is a chance in a strictly analytical data way that we COULD see a recovery. \n\nThis also shows that we COULD analytically see from here at this 167.54 low today see a 11.81% pop over 4-5 days which gets Tesla back to about 187.3 by Monday the 28th or Tuesday that 29th. \n\nLooking at Teslas Charts there is a key resistance area formed from 185.2 to 186.8. I also project that by time we would reach that level that is where the daily 20ema should be and historically where we could reject. This also would line up if this happened before November 29th a PERFECT falling wedge resistance rejection at the 186.8 level. This could be a great place to short Tesla again… Of course assuming Tesla does bounce from here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t9xsyts4pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eff94f8f4eac7e7a71196af9a9f8b3401b61ff1a\n\nThere was a nice support line on the VIX from the August peak to the current peak on SPY. The VIX just broke through that support today. Though looking at SPY you wouldn’t have noticed that. The VIX for putting in a pretty impressive red day and touching the 22.3 level for the first time since August 26th (which was Jackson Hole) has SPY looking pretty WEAK… \n\nLets just compare… so the last two times the VIX was here was August 26th and then November 11th. The HOD from those days was 399.35 on November 11th and 419.96 for august 26th. \n\nThat means SPY is about $5 lower than the November high and about $20 lower than the August high. Does this mean we are about to see a push up? I would say yes but it is hard to trust that this will continue to trend up with the way VOLD came out and dumped almost all morning. \n\nTo be completely honest the technical and even trying to trade level to level has been extremely difficult the last two weeks. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkxyvk95pd1a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82cecb10759e894a90da574552d642ae1c4457f7\n\n**Daily Log-**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ske2fn5pd1a1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5535b03f194bdbafab71b82160cfedf0760141f3\n\nReally tough trading day for me today… Swung some Tesla calls (of course they caught a bad news day again). Was looking good at open and tesla was looking like it might actually recover. Opened about -40% and saw Tesla finally start its push back over 176 resistance… Was looking good think I saw about -25% then looked back down and tesla flash crashed $3 and well you can see the results above. \n\nFrom there I just couldn’t see to time anything correctly. And the ones I did time today didn’t pay. It was highly frustrating watching my play do exactly as I expected it to do and struggling to even get 5% profits. However, of course if I was wrong it took those gains away no issue though. Theta once again won today. \n\nA red day for me which isn’t the end of the world. It does suck though knowing im not trading tomorrow and then Thursday markets closed and Friday is a half day. \n\nHOWEVER, days like today teach me important lessons. What are those lessons? 1. No matter how choppy the market is NEVER break your rules. There was a few times today where I could feel myself wanting to remove my stop losses knowing we were in this tight range and that I was correct. I thankfully stuck to my rules even if it cost me money. 2. Not every day is a tradeable day. For me and others with larger ports that can handle some red here and there without feeling a big hurt (lost about 2% today out of THIS account) its not a huge deal to trade these days. But for those of you with smaller ports or where “every dollar counts” on days like today and really days like we have had the last 2 weeks we have to be careful and we have to trade lightly. IF the day does not perfectly match the rules of your strategy then take the day off. There is nothing wrong with that… the beauty of this? There will ALWAYS be another day, week, month, year etc. to trade. However, we will NOT always have the money to trade… \n\nAnyone who doesn’t realize we are in survival mode until we return to the next easy mode bull market really need to take a step back. Of course there is A LOT of money to be made in a bear market… but what there also is is a lot of money to lose… and if for those with smaller ports or without the income to replenish those accounts you may never survive long enough to actually trade the next bull market if you don’t protect your capital. \n\nPeople really look down upon paper trading but honestly for those just starting out and even those with smaller ports I highly recommend it while you are learning. There really is not consciousable reason you HAVE TO trade with real money in the beginning. Personally I think 90% of traders would be better off paper trading as they learn options and learn the market while they build up enough spare capital (after their safety net) to be able to trade this market better and more strategically… its no doubt that smaller ports are harder to trade and even harder to win with. \n\nLong story short be realistic about just how hard this market is and how many good and great traders are struggling in this market. Its okay to struggle its not okay to carelessly waste money on this market. Protect your capital… live to trade another day. Take profits when you have them…. Do not be greedy!  \n \n\nYoutube will be up later!  \n \n\nReminder I will NOT be trading tomorrow so no pre-market tomorrow morning and I wont be trading at all tomorrow… busy day with the kids and some other appointments.', 'label': 1}, {'text': '$AMZN, good trade and bade trade, but still in profit.$AMZN\n\nThe stock opened with a small gap down, my first idea was to take the stock from a resistance level created in the last few days at $94 together with the descending trend line with a target at $92.3.\n\nThe trade was unsuccessful, and the stock took me out with a stop after twenty seconds of my entry.\n\nI knew it was not the right timing and my idea was still valid so I continued to follow the stock, after a few minutes the stock stopped at the $95 resistance level and continued to fall to $94, broke the level, and consolidated below it, I entered orders:\n\nEntry: $94\n\nStop loss - $94.37\n\nTake Profit Point - $93.27 (2:1 RRR) I identified a level after the losing trade from the pre-market and that is why $92.3 was not the take profit point.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s6f1tordtb1a1.png?width=2205&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ad2061c734b94ba59f2a124bdba6698025d97b8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nexkrordtb1a1.png?width=2205&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f52b13f52b0fb8b6b14e5916ac99fc6febd674a', 'label': 1}, {'text': '$SPY Bulls and bears fighting over $395', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Why is SPY going up?I bought some SPY puts but it’s going up, contrary to the market.

I felt a little off earlier in the week and struggled but today I ended on a good note.

While the actual IV % hasn’t really been too helpful trend wise we are seeing though that when the IV rank hits these levels is when we have typically seen the peak put in. this also is correlating well with us closing in on that 2022 bear market resistance line which on the weekly time frame has us right around 410 for next week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7s2dwxnt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e618ec5bdc747a7776531bce5288bed48b9824\n\nWhen we look at the daily chart here we can see we have put in some pretty stout resistance right there at 402.4 with two candle bodies rejecting it and the November 15th wick hitting that level too. \n\nThis is our key level until we close over this level I am going to start looking for a retrace. There is a pretty good chance come Monday that we see that blue rising wedge support broken. We need to see SPY open over 402.4 and hold it all day otherwise that rising wedge is broken and I will expect a retrace. However, if we can hold that support then I don’t see a reason why we don’t touch that 405.2 channel resistance. \n\nThe daily candle while small is technically a gravestone doji with a double top, however, due to the short day today and the overall low IV I wanted to wait till Monday to act on this. I don’t trust this shorten day to make a full play on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/auuiangot52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e21b119ee6783f38450e01968746795d27831c9\n\nPretty similar picture here on the weekly. Unless we open over 403.3 and hold that support all week we break the weekly support and will see a sell off back to the 390 to 398 range. \n\nIf the weekly can find support and a green open I will look for 408.9 channel resistance and then the bear market resistance line is that 410 as I mentioned earlier. \n\nInterestingly enough this is actually the first back to back green months that SPY has put in all year and the first back to back green months since July/ August 2021. \n\nI am going to watch this weekly rising wedge closely and watch that 410 bear resistance closely. I did decide to sit cash all weekend so that I could see what Monday brought and while I note IV is the lowest it has been in months I wasn’t quite willing to take a risk on a play over the weekend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22aim3yot52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=053a2d2d1e7fe783e2db3ea1bb477dfe451631a1\n\nMuch of the same here on Futures as we did back test and hold that daily 20ema finishing with a doji here. However, on Futures you can see that it actually turned 4033 previous resistance into support with 4050 being the next resistance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pxppuaept52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9091c7f73793367946c6a6a6549a3b2082f5443d\n\nIt is a little hard to tell but on the Futures weekly this week DID fail to make a new high. Last week touched 4050.75 and this week saw a high of 4049.25. With the weekly 50ema clearly being resistance this is going to be our key level to watch next week of 4050. However, we have found really nice support on the weekly 20ema down near 3925. \n\nThat blue rising wedge support line sits at 4050 and unless we open and hold that then we should expect a retrace next week. \n\nBear market resistance for futures weekly sits at 4120 for next week with key level resistance at 4085.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ne3c8zpt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bee284393c0f81ac4f792f0dea2d56eba4c7b69e\n\nSo looking ahead to next week… we got some gnarly data coming out AND we got JPOW speaking at 130pm Wednesday where he WILL be answering questions. Honestly with this economic data lineup I would not be surprised to see a choppy Monday/ Tuesday (maybe slightly green) and see a pretty large sell off the rest of the week. \n\nLooking at tesla it was once again the victim. Having yet again another large pre market that by open was miniscule and led to a red day. This may be the third or 4th time in the last two weeks I have seen this happen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/98ttt3lqt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8baa5ded2708a51d68c34a5d8e1d785f38c89af\n\nI posted this analysis of Tesla and its history of drops followed by pops since September. Well we are at day 3 of the pop and we are looking at about a 11.7% move from that bottom to current HOD. That’s pretty damn close to the average 4.2 day pop of 11.81%. \n\nI actually was pretty tempted to play puts on Tesla due to this trend but I did want to wait out Monday. I am seeing a nice double top right at 185.2 resistance. However, with Tesla holding the daily 8ema and still holding that green support line I was more nervous to jump into puts. There is a chance this pop could last another day or two and we could see a test of the daily 20ema near 192.5 Monday or of the red falling wedge resistance at 190.1 Monday. However, unless Tesla opens green and holds 185.2 Monday then we should break support line and I will be looking at the next leg down. \n\nHistorically speaking… we should look for about a 7day drop of 17.8%... so assuming that today was the top that means by December 6th we should look for a drop to about 152.2. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2r2rn16rt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39f978f535ead6ae4cb9800b78ae1d3e72dc5361\n\nLooking at Tesla falling wedge and the support line of that for December 6th that would give us a support bounce of about 150.6, however, if you look at this previous drop we did not touch the support line completely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmbbqjmrt52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4fbb644d301cbccbb44076501172bc8a532d386\n\nTesla weekly did break through the red bear channel resistance. This is the resistance if we use support from the October 3rd and 10th weekly candles and project it to the peak of the October 31st candle. However, there is also a blue bear channel using the peak of September 19th and October 31st candles. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7nkv04st52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d18513a39dc8d9ff04be246612f0d1f6ed732b9\n\nIt would then make our weekly chart look like this. I personally put far more weight into the blue bear channel than I do the red bear channel. That would mean we actually did not break through resistance and have resistance pegged at that magical 185.3 level next week. If Tesla holds under that level all week then that is a rejection of the bear channel and should bring more down side. I am seeing a bullish reversal dragonfly doji candle formed here, however, we DID fail to close back over the daily 200ema. This daily 200ema next week could act as resistance and form a double top which would lead to further downside. \n\nKey support- 166.4 -&gt; 154.2\n\nKey resistance- 192.9 -&gt; 207.2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bo36u9ptt52a1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef8ba1b78bc7c3e30c79e1926b9e943141d926dd\n\nThe VIX is finally nearing that danger zone. That lower red highlighted channel of 19.7 to 16.5. Every time a “peak” on SPY has been put in the VIX has broken under 19.7 or touched it first. \n\nI am really eyeing a case of VIX touching 19.7 or below Monday or Tuesday this week with SPY rejecting 405-410 area and then come Wednesday through Friday we see a pretty large drop due to JPOW and the economic data coming out. \n\n**$5k/10% challenge-** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og005m4ut52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5735a8738ed1fdd0aa063b6f671d5fa4a1c45cc\n\nAnother week of green here on the Challenge closing out with a net profit of $980 this week and total profits over the two weeks ive been running this challenge of $1740. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\nUnfortunately I struggled this week quite a bit. However, my biggest losses came from once again holding too long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfisi5tut52a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20de760d00def936f1d3ec68e15ae7538cc88422\n\nLooking at my weekly analysis here I actually impressively hit 100% win rate on all my SPY scalps this week. Had a pretty mild profit between the normal scalps/ $5k scalps of $1980 this week. I only scalped a total of 7 times this week with 3 of those coming from today. I just didn’t see a lot of good setups this week for scalps and struggled finding a good read on the technical earlier in the week. \n\nLooking at my level to level plays this is actually the first week I believe in about 7 weeks of playing level to level/ swings that I have close out my week red for strictly the level to level plays. The biggest mistake this week was my stop losses on those. I started the week off with a pretty large -50% loss on Tesla. It had popped from about -40% to -25% and then immediately to -50% before I could really do much on a massive drop. I also took a put on FOMC minute day to -78% that had I mitigated my loss properly at -20% or the -5% right before minutes I would have actually ended my week green. I as I had said was FAR too bearish for FOMC minutes (which I think come Wednesday when JPOW speaks im going to find out I was right but market didn’t react that way) and burnt myself. \n\nI also took a pretty large loss on a SPX call overnight last night. I have not seen the IV crush the way it did on SPX/ SPY overnight. I know we had the holiday and everything but for SPY opening barely down 0.1% I believe it was and for my strike being the first strike OTM I was extremely shocked to see my position open -65%. I was able to get out around -60% but that one hurt a lot. I don’t think anyone who played anything (unless they sold options) won with a swing today. \n\nMorale of the story is I let my losers run more than I let me winners run. This week I failed to properly mitigate my losses and that was a big mistake and one I will continue to learn from next week. \n\nOverall closing out the week at a total -$594 which is not bad in all reality but it is still my first red week since the week of September 12th. Looking to get back on a good track Monday and get back on that green gain train. \n\nI hope everyone has a great weekend! \n\nI will have YOUTUBE up later tonight or tomorrow (got some people doing work at the house and don’t have quiet time to make the video).', 'label': -1}, {'text': "This is where Elon was selling the bulk of his shares.

I called out this morning based on volatility that we could see 395 today… we had such a massive gap after that 399.2 support that it was the natural place we should move to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qnwo7sqggr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abf2ba3a3f27976acebf648f553204adc7d7f687\n\nInterestingly enough… after 393.7 support if we lose that volatility wise we have no real established support area until all the way down to 373.7. Could we be headed for a CPI gap fill over the next few weeks? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uulb209hgr2a1.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f47ab0bb77cac550303eb25827940f1e4fb1da36\n\nI believe we have quite the bear case forming here on spy with a smaller bull potential. But lets take a look at what we have here now…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqlsg5qhgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=203546bf0ee653d203b63ec303e2c475d05f5080\n\nLooking at SPY daily here I called out on Friday that I suspected that tiny gravestone doji double top rejection at 402.4 would open up the downside for today and I was correct. I should have played weekend swing puts but I was happy to sit cash as the weekends are pretty unpredictable as of late. \n\nBear case- today we opened red and attempted to retake the daily 200ema however was unable to, we broke the 3+ week long daily rising wedge pattern and we closed below the daily 8ema for the first time since the day before CPI. \n\nBull case- despite the rejection and closing under the daily 8 and 200ema we did bounce pretty hard off the key support range of 395 to 395.5 today. We are still maintaining that key lower support range of this consolidation pattern that SPY has been in since November 11th. \n\nFor me this breakdown shows that we have a potential to retest 390.1 support and potentially even lower depending on what JPOW says on Wednesday and depending on what all the economic data comes in at. I am bearish until we touch 390.1… If we touch and bounce off 390.1 again then I am seeing a nice consolidation channel from 390.1 to 402.5 and will play it at such. However if we break through and close under 390.1 then I am looking for at minimum the gap fill at 381.2. \n\nKey support- 396 -&gt; 392.6 -&gt; 390.1\n\nKey resistance- 399.2 -&gt; 402.4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yg2o8cigr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7777e1ba5e61d8807db2c0425b639b37064fc223\n\nMuch of the same case here on futures breaking that rising wedge. However, futures is still holding over one of the key support levels of 3970. If we see futures lose 3955 then I would feel confident in a 3910 retest of support. However, if futures can break back over 4000 we can start talking about a retest of 4020 and then 4040.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v7aupuigr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f55ad1ead9b49c0b10d8422a4714ce3f91b96ae\n\nTesla has the biggest bearish case of them all in my opinion when we look at the daily chart. We had that green support line that was 3 days long until today. That line was broke through today we also failed to even reach the falling wedge resistance line before we retraced. With this gravestone doji closing at Fridays candle body support of 182.9 this should open up some pretty large downside tomorrow. The only real bullish case I see for Tesla right now is that it did recover and close back over its daily 8ema EOD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sb5nbidjgr2a1.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e956cfe851e89a8798726f581aa3fa6c67216bc\n\nLast week I shared with you guys that tesla had a pretty uniformed drop and recovery cycle. I was seeing that we were averaging a drop of about 6.8 days for 17.82% while the recovery was about 4.5 days of 12.08%. \n\nWith todays new short term high we officially put in our 4th recovery day and reached 13.4% total recovery. \n\nIf we are trusting this trend that has been playing out for 3 months now that means we should expect about a 7day sell off of about 17.82% which puts Tesla at 154.9 around December 7th. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1l8qyrtjgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7af3c1395a4edfaa0271107bcd192d0826b9512\n\nIf we play out the falling wedge here by December 7th we could see 148.7 which is a total drop of 21.2%. However if we play out the % drop of 17.82% but not the number of days it took to get there we could see by November 30th (2 days) a touch of the red support line at 154.5. \n\nRealistically I would look for a test of support near 148-155 in the next 4-7 trading days. Biggest support to break through though will be that 166.2 level. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nb5x4lckgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060a5fcfcccf160399b111c5fc56bbba73474559\n\nI don’t love post weekly charts so early in the week but we did break through the blue resistance line of this current downward trend today. However we immediately rejected and hard rejected off the weekly 200ema. Key support for this weekly timeframe is 180.1. This current bear channel (thick red support line) gives us intraweek support of 154 and next week support of 152. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1ypnmtngr2a1.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b49e2fa1fe3ece40f4c34f686445047bba1158d\n\nAs much as I was looking for that 19.7 touch this week it appears that as of now we may not get it. We officially closed over the daily 8ema for the first time since October 14th. We are still in this bear channel though and its not quite time to get super excited but this is not a bad time in my opinion to start adding to some 30-60dte put positions. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ur18t0hlgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dccb7cb11673a4f1a2eacd4b6a306c09af6f1a16\n\nWas able to get a nice put scalp in this morning for the $5k challenge. Still haven’t quite been able to get any good big scalp wins but I also don’t want to stretch these plays out. This is one of those times where if I had a standard position size (usually $2000 for me) I would sometimes hold a little longer but with this larger bigger $5000 position I am more apt to quickly take profits and to take the first hit of profits. \n\nThis is where the emotional side of trading comes in. \n\n**Daily log-** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3x7gr0mgr2a1.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fccc2d95e2b22ee3d56cf1fc1318c5927a1e027\n\nOverall not a bad day and a great way to start the week off. Almost love starting the week off with a nice green day. Scalps were on fire today even if I closed them all early AF only for them all to 3-4x right after… but profit is profit! \n\nSome struggles with the level to level plays this morning. The first SPY put I played the bounce off 399.2 support however it was a fake bounce and broke down pretty quickly and I got out. I was just unfortunately too early on that first Tesla put and got stopped out before it saw green. \n\nNot a bad day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1angqsjmgr2a1.png?width=856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daeeb4c22ae758cb2fb6545bcde799f7e319c9e8\n\nLooks like a lot of you found green today too! \n\nHope you guys had a great day!
