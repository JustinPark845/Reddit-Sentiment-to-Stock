"$SPY + $GOVT + $GLD Blended Portfolio [DD]**TLDR**

Interesting  ""blended user portfolio"" from this newsletter I receive, shows a  combination of oversold tech/\[forbidden word\] and traditional defensive  positions. Also, LOL for the ""collar""...

Jokes aside, this is interesting insofar as it can have some convexity:

* **Bull case**: Tech is heavy oversold will rebound, treasuries are not expensive and will stay flat
* **Bear case**: Treasuries and Gold (and defensive equities) can offset further falls in riskier assets

Which  points to a very interesting situation: the classic risk parity  portfolio has been destroyed and it's heavily oversold. Even Gold is  heavy down. Any moderately less hawkish fed news might snap Treasuries  and S&amp;P 500 up strong.

**THE PORTFOLIO**

https://preview.redd.it/9lbz9a6ldm191.png?width=616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2967d75fa463e69af3a099c2aaf46c92199d4eef

 **FULL TEXT**

&gt;TL;DR  
Investors  are responding to the downturn in many ways. Here is a list of the most  common approaches we hear when talking with other TOGGLE users.  
Also remember that Fed Minutes come out today.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i5lwwn6odm191.png?width=613&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcc80f0b68e76bbf708d64e9f6f619a37d71c2ff

&gt; **The** **Treasury Bull**  
&gt;  
&gt;The safe-haven investor is going all-in into Treasuries. They believe that the Fed will be able to hike only so much and are happy to get \~3% from 10y US Treasuries and \~3% implied inflation from TIPS.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Staples Investor**  
&gt;  
&gt;Remember when Walmart rallied in Q4 of 2008? The Staples Investor remembers. This investor is pivoting to safe equities like staples, real estate, utilities and possibly energy. Recession or not, we need to eat, to rent and to turn on the lightbulbs. See you at the next recovery, they are confident they will be up.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Dividend Seeker**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Dividend Seeker is close in style to the Staples investor. With a nice drop in markets, dividends are becoming compelling again and the Dividend Seeker is looking for 4%+ dividends to weather the storm  
&gt;  
&gt;t**he Call Underwriter**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Call Underwriter owns a portfolio of equities and sells calls against it. Like the Dividend Seeker, they want yield. They do not believe equities will appreciate during the downturn, and seek the extra carry provided by selling premium.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Tech Investor**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Tech Investor is the new incarnation of the Staples Investor. Maybe 20 years ago Walmart was the safe choice, but the Tech Investor believes that now it‚Äôs Big Tech that is a safe choice. AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT are all infrastructure plays and they‚Äôre here to stay.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Short Seller**  
&gt;  
&gt;The short seller believes in doom and gloom and will use inverse ETFs or even put options to stay short the market. ‚Äú*The downturn has just begun, just wait till QT starts!*‚Äù said one of our most bearish users.   
&gt;  
&gt;*Note: QT is Quantitative Tightening, the unwind of QE.*  
&gt;  
&gt;t**he Cash Hoarder**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Cash Hoarder thrived in a time of low inflation and reasonable real rates. Now they are facing a real challenge as real rates for short term bonds are deeply negative, and they are thinking maybe about moving to Japan.   
&gt;  
&gt;*Note ‚Äòcash‚Äô here is used as a synonym for T-Bills of 3M or lower tenor.*  
&gt;  
&gt;**The Dollar Bull**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Dollar Bull knows how markets work during a recession. When the global economy falters, money flows back to the big ole US of A. The Dollar Bull is not unlike the cash hoarder, but they have a cross-currency view of things - and will pounce back on oversold foreign holdings one day.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The \[forbidden word\] Bull**  
&gt;  
&gt;The \[forbidden word\] Bull has discovered that a popular asset class cannot escape correlation with the equity market. After \[forbidden word\] suffered yet another 60% drop from peak, the \[forbidden word\] investor is eyeing that $29.7k level from July 2021 and thinking ‚Äúwill it breach or rebound?‚Äù.  
&gt;  
&gt;**he Gold Bug**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Gold Bug knows that the precious metal is where the buck stops. Come hell or high water, recession or inflation, Gold is the ultimate safe haven. Russia war? High inflation? Recession? Gold is the answer.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Conclusion**  
&gt;  
&gt;There are many valid approaches to invest for safety during a slowdown. If we blend together all these styles we get a defensive portfolio made of Treasuries, High Dividend / Defensive stocks, Gold, some \[forbidden word\] and a collar (i.e. a sold call and a long put).",1

"Next plan after yesterday's SPY CAll referenceYesterday I made a post where I recommended to buy SPY calls. For those of you who listened to the post congrats and for those who didn't, this is your second opportunity.

Banks are going back up so my recommendation is JPM calls or Capital one calls, American Express looks good too. Also, SHOP is trying to recover from the downtrend but this one is like a 50/50.

Remember, this will work if Trump does a partial trade deal or stays neutral so my best recommendation is to wait until the news. If news is positive buy calls, then if negative buy puts on ETF because it has more volume and liquidity which allows you to scape in a any given situation.",1

"Trading SPY and FOMC MeetingHey guys, this is another big week for the future of the market so I wanted to break down the action and where I think things are headed. A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is &gt; 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed?

This is the options chain for the calls expiring this week.  3200 was clearly a significant number, and AMZN closed at 3199.95.  That's fucking hilarious.  Someone clearly wanted it below that number.

The daily chart makes it pretty obvious that it's bottomed out.   3180 has been a crucial level many times in the past.  This level is also the point of control, which is where most of the volume has occurred in recent history.  These high volume areas are institutional buying.

&amp;#x200B;

We probably should have corrected more this week, at least to the 50 day moving average for SPY.  That would've been healthy, and it seemed like it tried to every day.  If you made money this week, well done, because I definitely got trapped.  Microsoft just kept popping, along with the rest of big tech except for AMZN.  The fact that every dip was bought up like nothing(especially Monday, what the fuck was that shit) means were probably going higher.  But big tech, the linchpin of the financial world right now, is stretched pretty thin with the exception of AMZN.  I think MSFT cools off next week, and AMZN pumps to keep us painfully churning here.

Position: 8/28 3215c

"1-week DD: Energy, Oil, earnings, and SPY.FYI, the glaring hole is this thesis is that it is based on a very limited window of time: the past week and the coming week.

This entire past week was greener than everyone expected. It appears to be fueled by money flowing into the companies that are posting better than (publically) expected results. Next week, there are more companies scheduled to post suprisingly green earnings reports. Some Energy/Oil companies have already posted earnings this week, and have pre-emptively boosted competitors and the industry ETFs.

The S&amp;P 500 has a 4.33% weight into Energy stocks. The separate ticker that tracks just these Energy stocks is XLE (Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF). I believe the larger Energy have even larger weight because they are diversified

     07/25 - 07/29
     XLE +10.80%
     SPY +4.26%

Both the industry and the SPY began their upward melt on Wednesday morning, separate from any government announcements. The companies are buying back stock, repaying debt, and paying dividends. All of this while only 1/3 of the businesses have posted earnings so far. Warren Buffett has been buying OXY throughout July. I think the Energy and SPY pump will continue into next week. Due to the many positive forces, shorting it would seem like a bad idea for whales that would consider it (right guys?!?!)

"Help Me Understand NFLXHow can they have positive earnings but incredibly negative FCF?  It looks like their spending on content is completely independent of ""cost of goods sold"", essentially as investment rather than an ongoing expense.

My understanding of stocks is heavily rooted in automobiles and semiconductors.  There, R&amp;D is a huge expense, for semiconductors moreso than autos.  Intel, AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia all subtract their absolutely massive R&amp;D expenditures from their equally massive gross margins (AMD's margins were unsustainable bad at less than 40%, Intel is doing well at better than 50%), but their earnings are nowhere near that high because the EPS already has the R&amp;D subtracted out.

Semiconductor companies cannot survive on their back catalogs, and massive R&amp;D spending is an ongoing necessity.  While it is not a cost of sales line item, it comes out of revenue before earnings.  Similarly, NFLX cannot survive on its back catalog (i.e. binge watching Stranger Things 1-3...2027) at least not at anything like its present valuation.  That is even more true with competitors pulling third party content back onto their own, new streaming platforms while continuing to produce new, competitive content.

From that end, I would argue that while there may be some justification for how NFLX calculates EPS, the way that they do it excludes a massive line item that they cannot reduce without tanking revenue.  Therefore, by their accounting standards, EPS is virtually meaningless while FCF is the only metric that matters.

From that standpoint, NFLX seems less like a profitable company with international subscriber growth issues and domestic market saturation and more like a company that is literally hemorrhaging capital in a model that will never generate actual profits.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding this badly, but that's the best I could do.  Have at it, fellow autists.",0

"puts on $META , $GOOGL (YouTube) &amp; ¬£TikTokU.S. Senate panel approves update of children's online privacy bill

WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee voted Wednesday to approve a measure that would raise the age children are given special online privacy protections to 16 and bar targeted advertising to children by companies like TikTok and Snapchat without consent.

The bill, which was adopted by voice vote, will now go to the full Senate for consideration. There currently is no version of this bill in the House of Representatives.

The bipartisan bill, sponsored by Democratic Senator Edward Markey along with Senators Bill Cassidy, Richard Blumenthal and Cynthia Lummis, would raise from 12 to 16 the age of the children afforded special privacy protections online under an update of Markey's 1998 Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

Markey has previously singled out for criticism companies like Meta's Facebook, Google's YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat. 
Under the new bill, companies would not be allowed to collect personal information on anyone 16 years old or younger without consent and require companies to allow young users to erase personal information. It would also create an office within the Federal Trade Commission, which currently enforces COPPA, to address online privacy and marketing concerns related to minors.",0

The answer is simple.  Please observe the following chart:

https://i.imgur.com/hY7pU6w.png

As you can see, between 1997 and 2003, as the Armadillo (AMD) population count in Arkansas went down, Walmart (WMT) stock price went up with a logarithmic correlation around ~18ln(x).  This is because as we had more trucks running on the road, more armadillos were getting run over because they are slow.

In short, Arkansas' entire economy is inversely related to the Armadillo population.  So if we can just get our claws on some fresh Armadillo data it could be worth millions upon millions for all of us.

"NVDA benchmarks results are better than expected!The performance of the new turing cards are out and reviewers are recommending that most gamers pick up the older generation of cards.

This outcome is so much better for shareholders than most people probably realize! There are a lot of comments across several platforms where people are claiming to have cancelled their preorders for the 2080ti and are picking up a 1080ti instead; however, if you check out tracking websites, such as nowinstock.net, the 2080ti is still sold out. Additionally, the 2080 is sold out at many vendors, but not all.

The people that don't care about blowing a lot of money on new tech (myself included) for less than linear performance gains will buy the new cards in great enough numbers. While the normies that don't want to spend that much for the top of the line will deplete the supply of the old generation of cards. Then after the old cards are gone, the turing cards will come down in price and capitalize on the people that were holding out for the price drop.

Additionally, the new architecture seems poised to be much more powerful for the professional market (with the non-gaming cards) with the addition of AI focused cores. It seems similar to AMDs development of Ryzen-TR-EPYC as a ""glued together"" scalable architecture. Not exactly the same, but primarily developed for higher end, higher margin markets (data center) while able to provide value to regular consumers.

"SPY Weekly TA 3/25/22What a week we had Who would have thought that the week would finish with 4 out of 5 green candles (technically one day was -0.03% but it shows as a green candle so I don‚Äôt really count it are red). But SPY opened the week at 444.34, seeing an intraweek low of 440.68 and closed the week at 452.69 just $0.19 below its high of 452.98. 

We will start at the weekly candle and work our way back. 

https://preview.redd.it/gmqwa9oaimp81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5999884fdfa51c2325eca379d5767858804f6a65

note- the grey and pink channels are from the daily chart and do not exactly correlate over to the weekly chart very well so they are off a little but on the daily you will see their true placements. 

On SPY weekly candle the week saw a mild 1.84% gain after the monsterous 5.82% gain last week. Spy now from last weeks low has gone from 415.79 as a low to a high of 452.98. That is a 2 week total gain of 8.9% total in two weeks. That is a ton of green movement. A few things to note on this chart going into next week to watch. 

The candle did finish as a VERY strong and solid hanging man candle. The hanging man candle is the opposite of a hammer candle. The hanging man candle COULD assume a reversal of trend going into next week. 

another thing to keep an eye on is the 20day EMA which lies now at 445.73. This is the first weekly candle closes ABOVE the 20 ema in 10 weeks. That is a very long time to be below the weekly 20 ema which generally trades as support not resistance. With this candle perched above the 20ema weekly we could see the potential for a bullish continuation. There is also a case to be made that SPY may attempt to test that 20 ema support intraweek before going any higher. 

A keep resistance I will be watching (that I also expected to test today‚Ä¶ and we may have tested had we not had the massive sell off with the VIX reaction to the Saudi attack) is 458. The level of 458 is currently set up as a double top and very well could play out as a triple top IF spy fails to break any daily candle above 458. 

Volume wise this week closed out at 385million total volume which is the lowest volume week since the week of December 27th. The interesting thing about that is that is was the last bullish week before spy saw a massive sell off that we are currently recovering from. 

Week candle wise: 

Bears would want to see the 20 ema at 445.73 and then the weekly 8 ema at 441.97 test as support and see that support fail with an closure of the week back BELOW the weekly 20 ema at minimum but preferably below the weekly 8 ema. 

Bulls would need to see a green week that tests 445.73 (weekly 20 ema) as support and confirms it before breaking cleanly through 458 with a weekly closure above 460 to prevent a double top from the week of January 18th which had a high of 460. Bulls also need to see a green continuation candle and avoid any sort of bearishly engulfing candle. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3qq09rscimp81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67a48e3227e4084b642646170760b00ff31fb4bf

Now looking at the daily as I had mentioned this one you can clearly see the channels much better and the overall trend. 

This week we technically had two red candles Wednesday which finished down 1.29% and then Monday which finished down 0.003% and as a doji. So technically we had three green days and two red days this week but as you can see on the chart due to Mondays price action it actually is represented as four green and one red. 

Monday was the day the markets over-reacted mid-day to JPOW letting us know a 0.5bps rate hike as for sure going to happen, that they may do additional 0.5bps rate hikes and that they could do some outside of the meetings if needed. The odd thing about the way the market reacted was 1. Everything he said was already mentioned the previous week at FOMC and during his Wednesday testimony yet the markets rallied like crazy. He really did not say anything out of line or that I would call surprising. Yet the markets acted like it was the first time they heard JPOW be hawkish‚Ä¶ it was odd. And 2. Despite the clear over reaction that sent SPY from its highs of 446 to 441 which is an impressive 1.1% drop intraday the markets still rallied from 441 to 444.39 to close the day at -0.03%. 

The markets at this point truly do not seem to care about anything that is going on anymore. Much like today they very dramatically over-reacted to the Saudi oil field attack but still recovered and matched the intraday high before close after being down a pretty significant amount. 

Wednesday was the only true red day this week managing a measily -1.29% close for the day. After 6 green candles myself and many though that could be the start of the dip but SPY had other places closing out another two green candles. 

Daily wise I mentioned on Wednesday that a close below the 100 EMA was bearish but SPY managed to get back above the 100 ema to close two candles above the 100 EMA for the first time since January 14th. 

Intraday volume has been extremely low with Monday being the highest volume at 107 million and the lowest on Thursday at 65 million. The weekly volume average this week was 77million per day compared to 111 million per day last week. That‚Äôs a 34million volume per day difference which is insane considering that‚Äôs half the volume we saw in one day on Thursday. 

I am not really sure where the volume went someone said this week at one point that it was about 60-80% retail trading this week and 20-40% institutions trading. I have two theories. Either institutions are still sitting in cash fearing a recession and a true crash OR they are waiting until SPY hits just the right point and they are going to pull the rug one last time before we see a new high. 

The lower volume is a concern not so much because once volume dramatically decreased we saw a dramatic bullrun but because what that increased volume can do to spy. This can either get very bloody or very green real fast if the volume returns to its normal. 

https://preview.redd.it/wz1m0f3fimp81.png?width=852&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe3cea8c5d615fa35df30ee3d0004d1721bdddb3

SPY has found itself inside a nice little bullish channel here that it does not seem to want to fall out of. This channel gives spy an opportunity to see 460 as a high Monday or if it were to break through the critical 450 level it could test support down near 444. 

https://preview.redd.it/x711xuxfimp81.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47b5ef2e83c7b8130e8441e0bb665f01f9e4082c

If bulls want to see this see 460 and test the double top it needs a clear break through and holding of the 453 resistance line it traded under today intraday. 

The true winner of this week was the VIX and Apple though. 

https://preview.redd.it/x2c8mvjhimp81.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a04f0ab1318576cdc0fcf49a9a3c13af1b582ac8

If you look at apple it has also been on an impressive tear from a low on March 15th of 150.38 to a high today of 175.28 giving it a beyond wild nine green daily candles in a row. I am not positive but I am sure this is close to some sort of record. Apple has gone up a total of 16.5% in 9 trading days and is only 4.3% of its ATH of 182.94.

Why am I mentioning Apple in a SPY TA post? Well here is why. Apple currently makes up 6.94% of the total weight of Spy. The last time we saw our massive dip in January and had the crazy bullish recovery back then guess who also led the charge then? You guessed it Apple. 

On January 24th SPY hit is low and reached its top on February 9th before retracing to its low on February 24th. Guess what days apple hit its low, high and low‚Ä¶. January 24th ÔÉ† February 9th ÔÉ† March 15th. 

Until we see apple close a true red day and it loses its momentum to the upside SPY is not going to see any downside. Currently Apple daily MACD is still very bullish and its RSI is only at 64 which if you look back to its peak in December it will easily run &gt;70. I watch apple intraday to guide where SPY is going. They don‚Äôt usually go far from eachother. I have even began picking up a few apple options here and there this week too depending on who is lagging. 

Now the VIX saw an absolutely impressive week opening at 25.14, with a intra week high of 25.14, a low of 20.8 today where it also closed. The Vix over the last 3 week has gone from a high of 37.52 all the way down to todays close at 20.8. That‚Äôs a 45% decrease in 3 weeks. So what does that mean? That means over the last three weeks we have seen a peak in fear in the markets which obviously coincides with the low in the market. Looking back to this last year VIX has run from an average of about 15 to 20 depending on the time frame. That means we are near the mean reversion of the VIX. 

To me this means that SPY will not be pulled along the way it has been the last week. The VIX intraday for this entire week has been the one in charge. Just like today we saw the massive VIX spike intraday but as soon as the VIX settled and started to trend back down Spy settled and started to trend back up and that‚Äôs when I knew I could capitalize on some calls. 

The VIX (fear) seems pretty low and numb at this point and I really do not see anything that is going to re-spook it the way it was in January and February. With the wildcards of inflation, fed movements, war, oil, etc. all priced in at this point we really cant expect anything to disrupt the VIX. Both ‚Äúfear‚Äù reactions this week (jpow Monday and then Saudi oil field attack today) were handled intraday and the fear disappeared very quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

10% challenge-

Weekly profit goal= $2500

actual profit goal= $1025 

(I took a big loss Monday on some perfectly badly timed calls as JPOW tanked the market and had to grind my way back to green).

I made 25 trades this week total (23 spy, 2 apple)

Apple- 2 for 2. Average%= 16%

Spy- 17 for 25, Average%= 3%

total average% per trade= 5% this week 

Big loss%= 70% on a 0dte call that went against me 

Biggest win%= 50% on some 0dte calls bought near the bottom today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall- it was a very good week for me. I did not make my profit goal but If I erased the one call I had went very heavy on Monday I would have beat my weekly profit goal. This week I continued to perfect my strategy and continued to test not only my patience but my trust in my indicators and strategy. Early in the week due to the JPOW dump I did get slightly discouraged but no one could have predicted that (though its also a risk to trade when a speaker is going to take like JPOW or Biden) and I should have had a proper stop loss on. This was a good week for me and today I finished on a very strong note. I had 2 days this week where I had no red trades all day also which is always great. 

I hope everyone has a great weekend and look forward to seeing you Monday!

"SPY - Emotional rollercoasterI don't usually trade options, but all the shit that happened over this past weekend made me think there is no way SPY not gonna drop. Placed my order first thing on Monday morning, saw my book value slowly go up over the day, I couldn't even focus at work. I took like a 2hrs coffee break and 4hrs lunch, and all I did was keep clicking refresh to see how much I made. I was up thousands at the end of the day and though to myself, no way Trump would keep quiet about China lowering their currency and I should hold over night. And I was right, around 8pm Monday SPY was 277, I was up almost 10k. I couldn't even sleep that night. I know 10k is not a lot of money to most of you guys, but I have never made so much from 2 days of trading. At that moment, I believe I could do anything, I serious consider taking the rest of week off and go on a small vacation. Then came premarket, SPY open at 283, I thought the trading system was buggy and forgot the after hour trading value. Came 930am when it actually open, mother fucker, it open at 285. I only made thousands instead of 10k, and I believed SPY would go lower so I held onto the options. Then I see my thousands turn into hundreds over the day, and turn into nothing at the end of day. I didn't lost money, but I felt like shit. I kept thinking ""if I sold the day before or that morning I could have made thousands"", ""I shouldn't be greedy"", and ""if my options go back into money I will sell right away"". Came this morning, I see SPY dropped and my confidence was back....until 1030. I couldn't handle this kinda emotional rollercoaster, I sold everything at noon for a small small small profit. I dont think I can handle this again.......",0

"$1764 into $7360. 317% Profit. Not exactly a YOLO. Here's my reasoning why I bought TSLA this earnings.Not exactly a YOLO. 

Here's why I bought (Analysis date is October 17th): 

""TSLA just got approved for manufacturing in China. This is due to China heavily investing in green energy, which is great. I think this is a huge win as one of the main problem in Tesla's manufacturing is the cost of labour. However, this requires an outlook that is confident in a positive trade deal in the U.S. v China Trade War.  


Plus, with this earnings release, I'm expecting huge volatility. Puts and calls should have an equal chance of winning big.""

$NVDA is a gaming company. It has been since its inception. Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


[Here is the google drive with the model paper, and position proof, updated whenever I update them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h2cTeiNRP07K8-2Wn4lYyQtbB_go2HGB?usp=sharing)


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.

* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.


* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.


* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.


Price Target:


* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. 


What I think:


I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&amp;D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.


I have +1 Jan 19 NVDA $350 Call that I purchased for $8.30. Proof in drive. Why not investing more? I don't want a lot of exposure and I'm poor.


TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity. ",1
"Watch the SPY 200 SMA Carefully Tomorrow - Mar 22, 2018The market rejected the SPY 100 SMA (~268) very strongly at the last hour of trading.

We bounced from the SPY 200 SMA back in January and now it looks we are heading back down to retest it. 

Looking back, January might have been the top. Tax bill got passed, no worries about tariffs or trade war, no worries about Powell and his interest rate schedule. It was a market full of optimism. And honestly, I think we‚Äôve may have double peaked two weeks ago when the SPY hit 280.

But don‚Äôt worry, if we do solidly break the 200 day, dont panic. The market will surely want to rekiss the 200 day, and when it does, I‚Äôm personally gonna sell everything and go short.

This is gonna be a fucking weird next 6 months. Things might get weirder if corporate earnings start being affected by tariff worries

Zen 2 in the desktop space has been selling like hotcakes, and the consensus is there's almost no reason to buy Intel at this moment. Obviously desktop is less important than server and mobile, but it shows consistency and mindshare growth.

AMD continues to lag behind Nvidia in GPU add in boards (AIBs), but it has regained some marketshare with its new 7nm RX5000 series being **very** competitive at their price points.

To top it all off, AMD's Q2 earnings posted conservative guidance. They've been trading in a channel, leading me to believe **not all of this information is priced in**. AMD is poised for a **massive beat**.

"AMZN DD from inside Bezos testing facilityJeff Bezos is a real-life James Bond villain, and Amazon will soon rule everything.

Go Long.

I'm at that age where I remember hearing about Amazon on on TV when my parents watched the news, but never really knowing what it was. There really was a time where people didn't know what ""online"" meant. Not everyone had a computer back then, maybe you knew someone who's family had one. When I was a kid I played one computer game and I had to have one. It was like 6 years later that it was cheap enough for my family to get one. Then it wasn't until I had my own money did I wind up on Amazon-- looking for something to buy that I couldn't get at Fred Myers or at the shops downtown. I don't really remember what I bought but I remember thinking how cool it was that something I wanted just came to my house. It's like being God, except you pay money to do it.

So sometimes I would buy stuff on Amazon. Usually around the Holidays or when I needed PC parts (Newegg mostly though). There was a lot of cool stuff you could buy on Amazon, like anything you needed. It just didn't make sense, because it took like a week to get something you could drive to the store for. That's before shipping costs. So, I bought a few things on Amazon from time to time.

I always got my stuff when they said it would arrive. I had never had a bad experience with Amazon really. Then one year I bought my mom a Kindle fire. She loved reading books, so it was perfect. She loved it. She bought so many books. Every day I saw her she had that Kindle. It lasted a little over a year. Out of warranty. So, I did what anyone would do and emailed Jeff Bezos and asked something along the lines of:

'what the heck mother trucker, your stupid great product failed the questionably short warranty expired. That's fucked up.' 

To my surprise I got an email back, from someone at Amazon stating that Jeff had asked them to respond to my email. The gist of what I recall was that the person told me 'sucks to suck, you can buy the new Kindle Fire HD though'. I was upset, but I couldn't not buy my mom a new Kindle. So, I did. I still shopped at Amazon after a cooling off period, like a week, then I bought some shorts or something idk. That Kindle Fire HD lasted up until last year though. 

Now, I buy everything on Amazon. I live in Seattle, so it's their testing ground. I get all my groceries of Amazon, with their Fresh Service. I can almost anything you need delivered within an hour if you want with Prime Now, or in two hours for free. I can get clothes to try on for a week and send back what I don't like (also sunglasses). Bulk deals are getting better with Pantry. The Treasure Truck shit is crazy.

The only thing I don't buy on Amazon is cigarettes and like snacks or a drink at work or walking around. They recently launched that Amazon GO store in January, you know the one where you just walk in and walk out. They're already putting up another and it says opening in the Fall. So, I'll probably get my snacks/drinks from there since it's close. I think Jeff has something against Tobacco cause it's the one thing they don't sell, you can buy Alcohol from the GO stores. 

Everyone I know is the same up here, some still go to grocery stores but they're also the ones who have a family, cars, and go to Costco. But they use Amazon for everything else. They have local market stuff, plus Whole Foods now. The everyday brand stuff is a good deal in my book-- and it keeps getting better. Plus, I can put in an order at like 8 pm to have something that gets to my place at fucking 6:30 in the morning.

It's some dark arts kind wizardry the fact that it's always here, always early, and always right. Also, the alcohol selection has pretty much anything you need. Not everyone has this yet, but everyone already has Prime-- well 100 million, but just wait til you can get anything and everything whenever you needed it from Amazon. Also imagine when recreational use of Marijuana is legal on the federal level and I guarantee you Amazon will put every dispensary out of business if Jeff decides to. 

I thought I've been seeing more of the Prime Air planes more frequently, then when I visited my dad and he mentioned seeing one. Looked it up: Amazon has their own fleet of 32 planes, started about two years ago with their first plane and now targeting 40 by the end of the year.

Seeing as r/wallstreetbets is famous for it's high quality financial advice, I immediately looked further into this new meme stock, ""SPY"", and to no surprise, it was primed for a short gamma super squeeze of all squeezes, also known as a **SGSSOAS**.

I then used an online tool, also known as a search engine, to discover the meaning behind ""EOD"". This is what I found;

I then used an eggplant, as suggested by the financial adviser's flair, to make a chart prediction:

"Thoughts on first Options trade: Sep 21 '18 $350 Put(NFLX). Closed with $3.3k USD profit.TLDR: held NFLX puts for one week. Cashed out at around 60% gains. Not sure if I'll do it again.

Screenshot of trade at: https://imgur.com/a/6I6Tjy4

I wanted to offer some thoughts from my week-long first options trade. I thought this might be interesting to people who are on the fence about buying options.

**Bought Sep 21 '18 $350 Put(NFLX) on June 20th, price 10.74.**

On June 20th, NFLX was trading at around 412 (&gt;200 P/E). I've been thinking about buying puts on it since it was trading at 350. So I thought this was as good a time as any to jump into options. So I bought 5 contracts at 10.74. (Note, I have a long-term equity position of &gt;500k. It was not a huge gamble for me.)

**Rest of the week of June 20th**

I think NFLX rose quickly to ~416 that week and my puts were down to ~9 at some point. I was beginning to think it's too easy to lose money with this.
Looking back, the rest of the week was uneventful even though I occasionally got excited about ~10% movements in quote price. 
The puts closed at around 10 on Friday. I thought I might as well see how it goes the next week.

**Monday June 25th**

As you probably know, Monday was crazy. There was fear that Trump will limit Chinese investments in tech and all shits hit the fan.
NFLX quickly fell below 390. My puts were up to ~17-19 range. (It wasn't a happy morning for me though, b/c my long term holdings were down &gt;15k from the pullback.)
NFLX was stabilizing at around 384. All of previous week, I was anxious about a big loss from first options trade. So I was thinking it's better to make a quick profit rather than risking big loss from my first trade.
On the other hand, I didn't want to close the trade so soon because I really thought that NFLX was vulnerable, and there is a chance that it could crash further. So I took the middle road and sold 3 contracts at 17.95 at about 11AM. (The price was selected to make back my initial investment. i.e. the 2 remaining contracts are pure profits)

Not much happened in rest of the day. I think the puts had a high of ~19, so I sold at a pretty good price.

**Tuesday June 26th**

It seems all worry about Chinese investments are gone. NFLX shot up &gt;4% in one day. My puts were down to 12. I regretted not selling at ~18 when I had the chance. Oh well.

**Wednesday June 27th**

NFLX was over 400 again, my puts were down to 10, 11 at some point in the morning. I was beginning to feel sad about missing out on more quick profits. I couldn't decide between bagholding or cashing out for the 2k profit.
Somehow, there was some new fear about trade policy in the afternoon, NFLX quickly fell to ~393. Volatility must have rose a lot too, b/c my puts quickly rose to ~17.
At this point, I've had enough of the volatility. So I sold the remaining 2 contracts at 16.75. 

Later in the afternoon, I think it rose to &gt;19. Oh well. Don't really regret the profit taking.

**Conclusions**

Things that went well:

* timing of the buy was good. It was just before the Monday pullback.
* happy with the quick profit taking from first trade, good learning experience without much trauma

What I didn't expect:

* NFLX is just too resilient. It was holding/rising even as nasdaq falls.
* Volatility is so high even for Sept contract. I don't know how FD buyers do it.

At this point, I think the anxiety from volatility is not worth it. Might not buy again.

"$AMDA can we talk? DD inside.Can we talk about $AMDA? Due to metal wear in medical implants causing metal poisoning, plastic parts causing bone loss and silicon nitride being biofriendly material, killing bacteria and promoting bone fusion I think it may be only a matter of time before silicon nitride catches momentum in spine joint and dental implants. Especially factoring the netflix documentary ""bleeding edge"" exposing the metal poisoning issue. Revision surgery for these complications are estimated at $10 billion a year in a $140 billion dollar medical implant market. The danger here is the reverse split and it's important to call the bottom before entry. My theory on bottom is based on a 15 million public offering recently closed. Don't really want to go into why I believe this indicates bottom as it's speculation. So i\`m only putting in enough I\`m completely safe with losing expecting to lose everything to revers splits and maintain strong hands. With the recent offering this should have a 35M  share  float so an estimated value of 17.5 million at .50 cents a share for the entire company(my maximum target buy price). The supposed brass ring of a $140 billion dollar industry. I can agree with this math, from what i've heard speculated, that this could translate into  a large profit, possibly on Buy out and share conversion. Obviously, looking at the ticker, This would require very strong hands to not get shook and I suggest minimizing risk here to a very small long bet. Seems like alot of Money invested into a solid material in initial public offering can be picked up off the trading room floor here for pennies on the dollar. Just hard to believe looking at the ticker and having to spend the time Deep diving the Research studies to ever consider a long hold here for the normies on wall street.

That 388.6 level held as hella strong support all day today with a few massive wicks below it but any time those wicks looked remotely bullish we got a huge spike in volume to close the candle over that key level. Bulls and bears could both have a fairly large argument that they were right. But the more I study this chart and thing about today and the VIX I feel the bulls are the winners today and this week (or at least tomorrow).

Looking at the daily we got a lot going on. 

Blue arrows- one could say today is a hanging man candle, however, a TRUE hanging man (reversal) is supposed to be 2x longer wick then body (thanks to Trav11s for pointing this out). If you look at the first arrow from May 17th you see the true hanging man causes a massive drop the next day‚Ä¶ however, if you look at the one from June 23rd (granted this candle was fighting between a hanging man and dragonfly (bullish) doji candle) we actually saw a massive gap up the next day. 

Gaps- we currently have TWO gaps below us now‚Ä¶ 381.37 to 378.83 and 370.18 to 369.38 and we have one gap left above 401.44 to 395.78. The gap above is the biggest and longest over due. 

Dotted blue bull channel- we now have a potential blue dotted bull channel forming that uses June 17th and June 23rd to form support and a ‚Äúprojected‚Äù resistance using the June 13th candle. This channel actually gives us a ton of upside and gives us plenty of room to see that 402 gap fill. 

Black dotted bear channel- we have a projected bear channel using June 13th, June 15th, June 24th and June 27th (today) as resistance. We then projected support off June 17th. This channel would prevent a upward gap fill and would favor both lower gaps filling by EOD. 

Rising wedge (bearish)- using the black dotted RESISTANCE line and the blue dotted SUPPORT line we actually are seeing a rising wedge. This can be considered an exhaustion trend and could signal a top is in. However, the one issue with rising wedges (and falling wedges for that matter) is with enough volume you can break through this and turn then into a channel instead of a wedge. Or the wedge can be extended. 

Today we broke below the daily 20ema of 388.6 numerous times and I believe that‚Äôs why that support held so well plus it was a bigger support from earlier in May. We closed essentially on the 20ema daily EMA today. 

https://preview.redd.it/fn2ontx1v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74c44622dc75da0a7305a5a65c98b9f875791f32

Now the VIX is still continuing to fall and we have yet to reach key support range of 25. But we are getting close. The one thing im seeing and its highlighted by these big blue arrows is that we are getting some fairly large spikes on the VIX that are all falling right around this resistance line and once those spikes hit we seem to be unwinding the vix the rest of the day. Today again EOD we saw volume and SPY in a bearish momentum trend while we actually saw VIX dropping. They were all pretty disconnected again last week. 

Looking at the big red lines on the vix we actually are seeing a similar falling wedge that appears to perfectly inverse the rising wedge on SPY. Now again if VIX falls hard enough it will go right through this support line and this support line is not nearly as strong as the resistance line. 

https://preview.redd.it/rywq74i2v8891.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=038b20c59452de2f017207545993b6235d6bc46e

By tomorrow and maybe even by open tomorrow we will see whether the VIX is going to break the falling wedge or not. 

Where am I at? Whats my bias? 

Well I actually was fairly bearish last week and we didn‚Äôt drop and by EOW I was then bullish. I this morning was feeling bearish for the week but with the 388.6 support holding so strong and today being hella low volume and VIX still unwinding I am actually feeling bullish. I think that SPY Wednesday we will see SPY fill the 401.55 gap on the daily (it could do it tomorrow with a 3.3% green day though‚Ä¶). 

But I al looking for a 401.55 gap fill and potentially see bigger bear channel (the one dating back to January) resistance test. If we were to gap fill on Wednesday we actually would see a perfect gap fill and channel resistance rejection at 402. That is my anticipation for this week. I think once the gap fills though we will most likely be bearish though but best case bulls could break this out to 410 range.

This is something I used to do a long time ago but I honestly stopped finding predictive value in it cause it was so close to SPY‚Ä¶ someone suggested with the inconsistency of SPY right now that it could be a good time to revisit on ES (SPY Futures) TA‚Ä¶ well lets take a look at the daily on ES and see what we got. 

Overall the rising wedge I had mentioned on SPY actually is invalidated by the ES chart. So if you look at the Black dotted line using June 15th and June 24th and resistance points today we actually wicked through that line which means its invalidated. So we shouldn‚Äôt see that SPY rising wedge play out (however, we could re draw the black line using todays top and see it play out later this week). 

There is a light blue bull channel using the support line from June 21, 22, 23 and 24th that seems pretty strong. We did not touch that line today but there is a case to be made that if todays (June 28th) candle was to drop we might see it touch that point which shows support at 3870. 

Now the daily candle for yesterday on ES actually is a gravestone doji which usually when seen at the top of a bullish run can signal a reversal. 

Bull case for ES- we will look to ride the daily 20ema support at 3896.5 overnight and look to test the new rising wedge resistance line at 3965. Bulls want to see a clean break through 3965 and eventually will look to retake that 4020 level. This 4020 level is an approximation of the 401.55 gap fill that I spoke of earlier. 

Bear case for ES- tonight bears will look to break under the daily 20ema of 3896 and tomorrow break through the daily 8ema of 3854. Once 3854 is broken the blue dotted support line from this rally will be broken. Once that is broken bears will look to break down 3761 support next. 

Overall looking at the ES chart I don‚Äôt feel that my bias for tomorrow has really changed at all. I am slightly concerned by the gravestone doji candle from yesterday but its not always a given. 

10% challenge-

Today not a great day I entered a 0dte put this morning when we broke through 388.6 the first time with a 15min candle. We had tons of momentum and VIX was in our favor. However we then saw two full candles with ridiculous wicks to the upside on them. I was looking for a fakeout recovery then further drill that never came. Tough loss there. 

End of day I entered another 0dte put that eventually saw 50% green only to go to -80% green and then was able to thankfully close it back out for 0% on a quick wick. I fully misplayed that and shoulda taken profits. I had a 100% take profit order set and once again we had all the signs aligning we were going to see a breakdown closer to 386 EOD but it never came. Hindsight I shoulda taken the 50% gains to recover 50% of that morning put loss. Live and learn and die but greed. 

I was not going to play any positions over night and honestly I probably shouldn‚Äôt have played anything overnight but here I am in a 394C 2dte. When I started to dig into my TA and that 388 support more I felt that was bullish and not bearish. 

I entered these UVXY 14.5C this morning when it looked like we were breaking out. They never really saw green as it almost immediately dropped. I am using these as a hedge for the week as I do think by time Friday comes we will have filled the Gap and seen a VIX bounce at 25-26 which will cause a spike in the VIX like usual. I could be wrong but I felt compelled to hold this since its 4dte and I know UVXY loves to move in mysterious ways sometimes. 

Overall not a great day for me and further case that if I stopped trading Mondays I would be way more profitable.

Now, you can watch their cars literally race past one another at insane speeds on a quarter-mile strip of pavement.

DragTimes, a popular YouTube channel, recently staged such a race between the Lucid Air Dream Edition and Tesla‚Äôs Model S Plaid. Both cars are their company‚Äôs highest-performance sedans, meaning they each offer exceptional horsepower.

"5-31-22 Spy Daily TaAfter being gone for the weekend on a family camping trip that was unfortunately cut short due to catching the Rona (again) I am back in action‚Ä¶ mostly. Trade the opening hour today, a few intraday moments and power hour today. Overall I have a similar plan tomorrow. 

https://preview.redd.it/4kko0kjvbw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4835140d30388ffff2aa332d493307662aa8c4f2

Overall I didn‚Äôt miss much today‚Ä¶ mostly a pretty unexcited and expected range day. Mondays (todays the Monday of the week) lately have been pretty sideways trading. Afterhours is showing some green but nothing to overly write home about yet. However there is a support line that the 15min charts holding fairly well and Friday we saw an afterhours rejection of the resistance line Friday of the bull channel and spy intraday today failed to break that high. 

However as we take a look at the daily and the weekly we see a little more detail of possible moves. Overall I will try and be a little more detailed here due to no post on Friday. 

https://preview.redd.it/7i0b7gywbw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07060e2199267be23baa67c6f5cc953f299d131c

Note the highlighted circles that I will later speak on.

https://preview.redd.it/oqt5l7sxbw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46c2066249e60daa56d5bca6522a15dc22527b67

On the daily we have a very nice bull channel we have been trading with in since May 19th with support being established on May 20th. Friday we saw a pretty much wickless candle close and I had mentioned in my server Friday I felt about 75% confident in overweekend puts but I didn‚Äôt enter then as I knew I would be camping and was unsure of service. Overall those would have printed today. We have followed that wickless candle up with a beautiful red doji. While hard to tell it is technically a gravestone doji due to the candle body being slightly shifted below which is actually a signal of a reversal of trend. Previous daily tends ending in a doji like today have resulted in massive sell offs. 

We also have a gap on the daily from 407.04 to 407.7 that will need to be filled. 

In addition what we saw today was a rejection intraday of 416.5 which now makes a double top there on the 15min chart. In addition if we look back to April 26th to May 5th this was an important price level. SPY failing to reach this Friday and hard rejecting it today during a bear market rally in my opinion is a bearish sign . I believe SPY has lost its bear market rally momentum and we are going to see a retest of lower support. If we look at the May 2nd and May 6th candle 405.6 was a major support for them (and resistance on May 9th/ 10th). It is likely we see a retest of this area before we go any higher. That would be a 1.7% drop from close today. Everyone is saying this is just like Marchs rally but it really in many ways is not and this candle finish today is confirmation that it is not going to be the same result. I think many people are about to get really burnt on that. 

I adjusted my probable/ improable zones a little as you can see. 

If SPY is able to continue this rally though, we could see 427 as fast as Friday. That is a likely high and rejection zone for SPY. If we managed to break through that we could see as high as 438 by June 7th (right before the next CPI). 

https://preview.redd.it/b58otmi3cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1f194e97ba671f4558f34f77e80b5e2d7decc3f

One thing to note on the weekly of SPY is that it FAILED to close and break above the weekly 8ema last week. Today did see us break it momentarily however we are not at a doji on the weekly and we are seeing SPY well below the weekly 8ema again. Likely support is the weekly 100ema of 405.92 (remember I said 405.6 was a key support area earlier‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs likely to be tested)‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/19kvqz44cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f0447485c59723a540b5b0de4b7e267ff0b6f25

Apple has the same finish today with a near double top doji and a gap from 144.34 to 145.26. 

https://preview.redd.it/3v6olau4cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=718a7e4f39a829d012f6079422599be1e4a77f2b

You guess it‚Ä¶ QQQ has the actual double top with a doji on the daily AND a gap from 300.92 to 302.42.

https://preview.redd.it/9ebdvpi5cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34610e7b0fd28436d0312c42a5fe98deebf293b8

Interestingly the VIX opened with a massive near $2 gap up which is most likely the result of the morning dump. However once we breached 30 for a short period of time we did see it sell off the rest of the day before settling with 26 as its low. It never managed to break its Fridays lows. 

The things I am seeing with the VIX is that we are still making lower highs BUT we are really struggling to make lower lows too. I drew a fat red line at VIX of 25 as the line in the sand. We will not have a true rally under VIX drops back under 25. 

A few things to keep in mind as we head into tomorrow. Tomorrow starts a new month and we know how Spy can change tunes fairly quickly. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/geqfscw6cw291.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4870ebb67d04d4e3961ba3e92516a31ccaf82430

While this is NOT new news‚Ä¶ this is enough to ‚Äúspook‚Äù the market tomorrow in my opinion. Plus we don‚Äôt really know what this is going to look like. 

Overall I am bearish for tomorrow. If SPY can hold the 405 support area either tomorrow or this week I suspect we could get a bounce and rally further up towards that 430-440 levels. However, if we break below and especially close below 405 I do believe we have some more downside headed our way. This was enough of a bounce to shake people outta long puts and trap people in long calls to start the trend back down. 

If SPY is big green tomorrow and recontinues the bull run on good momentum today like we saw last week I will too remain bullish till we see closer to that 430.

"SPY - Emotional rollercoasterI don't usually trade options, but all the shit that happened over this past weekend made me think there is no way SPY not gonna drop. Placed my order first thing on Monday morning, saw my book value slowly go up over the day, I couldn't even focus at work. I took like a 2hrs coffee break and 4hrs lunch, and all I did was keep clicking refresh to see how much I made. I was up thousands at the end of the day and though to myself, no way Trump would keep quiet about China lowering their currency and I should hold over night. And I was right, around 8pm Monday SPY was 277, I was up almost 10k. I couldn't even sleep that night. I know 10k is not a lot of money to most of you guys, but I have never made so much from 2 days of trading. At that moment, I believe I could do anything, I serious consider taking the rest of week off and go on a small vacation. Then came premarket, SPY open at 283, I thought the trading system was buggy and forgot the after hour trading value. Came 930am when it actually open, mother fucker, it open at 285. I only made thousands instead of 10k, and I believed SPY would go lower so I held onto the options. Then I see my thousands turn into hundreds over the day, and turn into nothing at the end of day. I didn't lost money, but I felt like shit. I kept thinking ""if I sold the day before or that morning I could have made thousands"", ""I shouldn't be greedy"", and ""if my options go back into money I will sell right away"". Came this morning, I see SPY dropped and my confidence was back....until 1030. I couldn't handle this kinda emotional rollercoaster, I sold everything at noon for a small small small profit.

"$SPY 5 reasons why I am going long (short term trade)**Tldr**

Russia is actively working for a way out of Ukraine. Leading indicators are bullish. Technicals are good. Time for a risk-reversal.

&amp;#x200B;

**WHY GO LONG**

1. **Geopolitics are easing** 
   1. Russia is building a case out of Ukraine
      1. Russian television is changing the tone in respect to Ukraine, [becoming more cautious](https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/urh295/mikhail_khodaryonok_donne_une_%C3%A9valuation/)
      2. Putin is acceptoing of [Finland and Sweden joining NATO](https://www.ft.com/content/b3f29756-06e1-443d-8364-bd98c7cd19d4), exhibit A
2. **Fundamentals are supportive**
   1. [Market Leading Indicators](https://toggle.ai/my-toggle)  are turning postive, exhibit B
3. **Technicals are cleaner**
   1. Positions have been cleared (we are at option expiry week)
   2. Seasonality is [good](https://toggle.ai/chart/spx/spx.fair_value_seasonality(years=5,fcst_horiz=1m))
   3. HOWEVER, the 50/200 MACD looks like [shit](https://toggle.ai/chart/spx/spx.price_mavg_spread(horiz=50d,horiz2=200d))

&amp;#x200B;

**HOW I PLAN TO GO LONG**

With VIX at 27ish, the only thing to do is a Risk Reversal. I can sell a 7% OTM put and buy a 3% OTM Call. That keeps me safe up to \~$372. 

And if the market rallies hard I can sell a future and invert my position.

&amp;#x200B;

"Speculation: MSFT could see considerable growth this summer?This is by no means any kind of DD or real analysis. I am long MSFT and as a professional software engineer, I love the direction Nadella has taken this company in.

June 9th Microsoft will host a press conference at E3. Widely expected to unveil their new console, games, and partnerships, they are also likely to put on display their xCloud streaming (perhaps new hardware device as well) service. This will likely compete with Google's Stadia and nVidia's GeForce Now.

I'm not a big gamer but I own an nVidia Shield and love the game streaming aspect. With Microsoft owning the second largest cloud infrastructure I have huge optimism in their ability to execute on this vision.

Additionally, their relationship with Nintendo continues to become more inclusive. Rumors that you may be able to share one game ecosystem between both companies and devices including mobile, desktop, console, TV.

Another speculative play is Microsoft's ability to land the US Military's 10 billion JEDI contract. It seems as though this announcement may not come until July at the earliest, however, MSFT already has partnerships with DOD with Hololens.

I bought some June/July calls when we hit these recent lows. MSFT has a relatively low IV compared to historical volatility. I'm thinking there's still room to grow here; anyone else?",1

Annual Prime subscriptions, for which Amazon is fully paid up front but records revenue a quarter at a time, contribute here.""

So amazon got a ton of cash from raising their prime subscriptions and getting paid up-front for them, but this doesn't get recorded as revenue for Q2.  Could this be a major factor in beating EPS but missing revenue?

"Sold TSLA covered calls... I barely know what I'm doing.I own 700 shares of TSLA for which I sold 7 covered calls, $1350 Feb 18.  I got $37K premium for that, which seems pretty good right?

I'm hoping it goes up (of course not passed $1350). Then I plan to repeat this, though next time I'll probably select a target high enough as to be less likely to get called, as I would like to hold my shares indefinitely.  Also, I used that 37K to buy 35 more shares of TSLA... if the strategy works out, in 6-8 months maybe I'll have enough for 8 calls.

I realize that TSLA could pop at any time and I'll miss out on a lot of upside, but honestly I'd be cool with selling @ $1350 a share. And if it goes down (like it did lately) by Feb 18, I'll just adjust and sell more covered calls.

Please tell me if my strategy is foolish/flawed.   I am fairly newb to this.  Thanks!

"My thoughts on AMDThroughout the past year, I have been researching computer parts to build my own PC, and I‚Äôd say around just half a year ago, PC building subreddits and people in general recommended both AMD and INTC cpus for building a PC. Each had their pros and cons. However since the release of the new line of AMD CPUs, Id say for 95% or more of PC builds, people are recommending AMD cpus. In addition, they are gaining traction in the medium/high end gpu market. Before the release of their Ryzen 5700 gpu line, their medium/high end gpus were kind of a joke and people stuck with Nvidia. Now, AMDs top gpu (5700 XT) is a competitor with the 2070 super card and AMD in the CPU AND GPU market offers same or better performance compared to Intel and Nvidia at a MUCH better price. Especially seen in the CPU market.",1

"$TSLA and $TWTR and TSLA earnings - Hear me out hereSo earnings are coming up this week for TSLA.. ELON Musks almost entire net worth is really in the stock of his companies (TSLA and Space X)...

The offer to buy out Twitter can only happen if 1 of 2 things happens:

* Elon Musk sells his stock in TSLA (and owns less of TSLA going forward); or
* Elon Musk uses his stock as collateral to leverage some massive level debt in order to buy Twatter.

Lets assume he uses his TSLA stock as leverage... I don't think a bank would give Elon Musk a loan for that much money without knowing how TSLA did during Q122. They probably got a peak, were happy with what they saw and were good with him putting an offer forward for the 43 billy for Twatter because the stock (what he'll use for collateral) will continue to rise in value going forward PRIOR to Q122 earnings date.

Am I reading too much into this and going full tard or am I making sense? Are my TSLA 1050 5/20 calls going to print?",1

"$AAPL is the main reason we didn't see a lower leg down today with $SPYFirst of all, I hope everyone had a good day today.

Now this won't be that technical, because I am not a smart man. I wouldn't be here if I was. But this morning as I was watching $SPY and looking at my puts go up in price at open I was happy for about 5 minutes and then watched as they flipped and went back down. I was watching my list and trying to figure out why is this happening. Probably like most people here, or at least the other people who are highly regarded like me.

Well I found it, partly from other people smarter then me pointing it out. But I did a little work hitting print screen and making some pictures everyone can look at.

[So this was $SPY today.](https://preview.redd.it/j15efj8mygb91.jpg?width=2934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e57b33aba4c6841f4a17a4fd8068cf32dcc0d8c4)

Now for the smart people here they know that $SPY is a bunch of different stocks bundle up into one stock people can trade. So if all the stocks in that ETF are doing bad then the ETF will go down. This will also cause it to go up if they are all doing good. Pretty simple right? Well it's not that simple, but it will work for what I am trying to get across.

So $SPY is an ETF and is made up of a bunch of stocks and those stocks are bunched up into sectors and they are weighted by how much $SPY has invested in each one. The biggest/heaviest one is for technology and you can look it up under $XLK.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here I did it for you, this is today.](https://preview.redd.it/kzt8so430hb91.jpg?width=2962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff161fdb9f1abdcc7c6dc1b587cef170e4ef43bc)

If you wanna check out the full list you can see it here.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/)

If you don't check it out I will break it down real fast for you.

Tech 24.17%

Healthcare 15.17%

Financial Services 12.92%

Consumer Cyclical 10.28%

Communication Services 8.84%

There is other stuff but I am lazy, just click the link and check for yourself.

So back to $XLK and why it's important. In this group of stocks are a few everyone here knows. But the one I wanna talk about is $AAPL which is 5.90% of the total assets $SPY has invested. That not just under the tech umbrella, that is everything. It might not seem like a big deal when you see $MSFT is 5.60% of $SPY's assets. But trust me that .30% is a big deal. Here take a look at this chart.

&amp;#x200B;

[Does this look pretty familiar to you?](https://preview.redd.it/ub1ux4qe2hb91.jpg?width=2984&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d1a805de3adf6be9b17a31ff57be4e4cd10d977)

Did you just do a double take? I know I did this afternoon when I was looking at it. This is $AAPL holding up $XLK which is helping hold up $SPY. Another thing to check out is this.

[I hate $AAPL.](https://preview.redd.it/0z8a1nd43hb91.jpg?width=695&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e082b16b211bcae41a77fc1399cbd3b9870e84)

That is pretty much it, I already hated Apple for how they treat their customers and force you to stay in their ecosystem. Now I hate them because they are making my puts bleed.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks in the United States rallied the most in nine months, with major averages rising at least 2% on hopes that the omicron variant will not derail global growth.
* Treasuries fell, causing two-year yields to reach their highest level since March 2020.
* The rebound was led by technology stocks, which led the decline last week. The Nasdaq 100 index increased by 3%, an etf that tracks newly public companies increased by 5%, and small caps increased by 2%. The S&amp;P 500 recovered all of the losses suffered following Jerome Powell's hawkish stance a week ago, and was only 0.3% lower than its previous close before the Omicron variant shook markets.
* The CBOE volatility index fell five points to 22. In New York, the dollar fell and crude oil rose above $71 per barrel.
* Risk assets are recovering this week after preliminary data showed that the surge in omicron cases has not overwhelmed hospitals and China moved to expand economic support. A Goldman Sachs group basket of non-profitable technology firms rose nearly 6% on Tuesday, recouping nearly half of last week's losses.
* In terms of data, the US trade deficit shrank, while third-quarter productivity fell. Private consumption was the most important driver of the eurozone's most recent economic expansion.

#### Commentary:

* Nice run today from the Bulls.
* I still maintain that we will see a Christmas rally if Bulls hold 462.
* Depending on futures 469.71 - 468.69 may act as support or resistance (pointed out on gap analysis chart)
* Best case for Bulls tomorrow is they establish and hold support at 469.71 - 468.69 for more upside.
* Base case for Bears is they fill all of the gap (463.68 - 460.59 - 459.15) tomorrow as quickly as possible.
* **Expecting a dip tomorrow - look for gap fill to hold for downside risk**

TSLA stock in one picture,1
"Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and holdEvery other comment right now is a shill lamenting the stupidity of everyone who‚Äôs still holding or how sad it is the big guy won again or some other gloomy horseshit. 

To all of you who are out there who‚Äôve ever thought ‚Äúoh man, if I‚Äôd only bought X stock X years ago I‚Äôd be rich!‚Äù - if you aren‚Äôt holding right now, you‚Äôre wrong. 

I‚Äôm an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn‚Äôt sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I‚Äôm holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it‚Äôs too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin‚Äôs mistake? No actual hedging. Don‚Äôt be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won‚Äôt help if you‚Äôre making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I‚Äôve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don‚Äôt give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren‚Äôt the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It‚Äôs not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we‚Äôre in dire straits probably didn‚Äôt comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold.

"Please, join me in understanding $TSLA. I love this stock!Tesla is now in second place for total sh0rt 1nteres1 (mods ü•±)I like this stock.

It is time. Unlike other fake messiahs like RC, Elon has literally risked his career supporting our giddy adventures. Love it or hate it, Tesla RIPS. Last split happened at the same time of year, in a very different market. However I‚Äôm thinking about a few things:

Presidential cycles: 

(formatted weird due to some rules)

For like the last 20 years year2quarter2 has shown to be the worst quarter of a presidency, and year2quarter3 until year3quarter2 the best. So far this has also held true this year.

Tesla‚Äôs trend:

Absolutely rips through the back end of the year into January/February. With clean energy bill being pushed harder than ever, I‚Äôm doubtful that Tesla will struggle to perform considering their overall advances in clean energy and FSD.

NOt JuSt a eV cOMpanY:

It really isn‚Äôt. The data that Tesla has gathered due to Elon‚Äôs commitment to R&amp;D is insurmountable to any other car company. Although it sounds easy for F and GM to completely convert their factories to all electric, it‚Äôs just not. Have you ever seen the Jetsons? Self driving cars are coming. We all know it. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to create a FSD car within the time frame he was essentially given by our society. Sure it might be a bubble, but I‚Äôd rather bet on the company with the biggest head start.

Elon Musk:

You gotta love him. He‚Äôs helped the apes during GME and that currency with the puppy on it. And he‚Äôs an absolute savage. I‚Äôm also doubtful that he will pull an RC on us, as he‚Äôs already the richest man in the world and is likely not trying to rip his investors.

TLDR: Why the fuck haven‚Äôt we rallied behind Elon more. He literally risks his career by tweeting and supporting our antics. RC is a fraud and some of you still support him?! If you don‚Äôt like Teslas fundamentals, just suck it up and invest in Papa Musk. Now, most of our wife‚Äôs boyfriends can afford it. What if elon gets us to MARS in 2 years?

"SPY DD- Market Crash incoming most likelySo I've been trading SPY options for like 7 days now and the market seems like it's glued to 300. I bought 302 calls- lost money. I bought 300 puts- lost money. So I figured I should do some actual analysis instead of burning my money. 

So I googled ""300"" to figure out why SPY liked it so much and it led me to the wiki page for the Battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartans died to some Persians. When did the Battle happen? Late in the month of September. 

We are currently in the month of September and the President of the stock market just basically threatened to go to war with all of Persia last night on Twitter. If my calculations are correct, SPY 300 is fucked and has the possibility of reaching 0 very soon. 

Tldr; the SPY 300, much like the 300 of Sparta, is gonna get fucked by the end of this month. Load up on puts they literally cannot go tits up.",1

"$SPY for the next 6-12 months Its cool to use tech analysis to try and gauge the psychology of the markets right now, but we cant deny the importance of the macro environment. However that hasn't stopped the broad market from showing optimism and this is not just a bear trap, the lower low has been denied entry and we are in a reverse [head and shoulders](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/headandshoulders/) pattern on [SPY ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/)and NDX.

[JPM ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-JPM/)just published doom city saying 25% drawdown in the next 4 months, if so looking at that and historically, we have [SPY ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/)300 as the bottom respectively, that only happens if the elevator comes like in the 70s and the dot com crash. Until that happens though, [SPY ](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AMEX-SPY/)to 440 before I see any good positions for shorts. Crashes happen fast though who knows on a 6-12 month outlook, but were already down 25% NDX, historically crashes can hit 50% drawdown on NDX easy, but the snapback is always very quick within 1-2 months of the bottom, cant really time these things. I'm only looking for a 1:8 put to hedge the port at the right price, maybe if this trendline doesn't get blasted.

"SPY- 1/26 lets talk about it (reposted with edit per mod)Note- my posts maybe on the later sides some day cause I'm off work with covid and home with the family till i go back to work. I may head back to work finally monday. If i do i may not always post every night if i am too busy before work. I work night shift so sometime during the night though i will post. Just know once i get back to work full time i wont post as much unfortunately. 

Anyways lets get into it! 

To me today was a confirmation day. I fully expected after market and futures wise that we woulda started the day down 1-2% not up 1.5% i believe it was. Nonetheless today was a very telling day in my opinion. What we saw today was a retest of the upper limit of this downward bearish channel we have been trading in since January 3rd. Look at the green dotted channel on the 30 minute. It has developed some very strong resistance now with from January 3rd to present being touched and officially rejected 4 times and 2 other times where it nearly touched the line. Thats a very stout resistance line that if we ever break it should provide some very heavy upward movement. https://i.imgur.com/bBk4yhZ.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/8iDmj1m.jpeg

What i watched develop this morning intraday (always watching the 30 min) was the MACD turning from buy to sell AND most importantly as we neared the top of the channel at the time of 441.5 was that the RSI was around 63. To me that showed that this did not have the momentum to break through. When we rejected the 441.5 twice i bought some 2/4 440P and 339p and one 1/28 440p... all three played very heavily. I got greedy and missed some gains though when we broke 430 for a second but recovered to 433 before market close. I was looking for the bottom drop and never got it. Left some on the table but still paid out &gt;50% for all 3.  Not bad at all. 

Things im watching for tomorrow is Apple crushing earnings and being up 5% after hours. Now apple can NOT hold the market up on its own as much as people like to think it can. However oddly enough once apple released cry*pto pulled outta its nose dive and spy went from red to green. However, take tesla for instance today... tesla was down 5% while spy was up nearly 2% and tesla finished down 11%. Even the otherday on Tuesday Microsoft was up while the market was down if i remember correctly (or inverse). Either way what im saying is one company will not hold the market up. Though apple is the first big top 10 to release a stellar earnings so some sentiment may change... just keep in mind after and pre market are easily skewed by retail... tesla today was up right until the market open then we saw the true hedgefund take... 
(side note i bet tesla starts its decline down to 500-600 now... tesla today once again broke 25% correction from highs... the market FINALLY sees tesla as over valued and i think we see them take a fairly big hit down. Once this does it will finish our correction of spy and nasdaq to total of 25%... i think msft and apple will maintain their valuations). 

So onto tomorrow what should we suspect? 

Well interestingly after hours on my chart (some webull users say they did not see this on theirs). I saw a massive spike up to again fall just short of the green dotted resistance line. 

30 min macd did turn to buy. Rsi is curling upward and leaving room for another run at this resistance line. Though i doubt we break it. My anticipation is tomorrow we test that resistance line early morning again near 439-440 and then dip after again. 

We saw extremely strong support today near 430. We DID break it very quickly but the buy pressure was too much. This is our fight zone. 430 and 440. One thing i am seeing is we have moved so far upward in this green dotted channel that unless we see some massive sell off days despite being bearish long term we will break it. However 2 or 3 days of nothing but sell offs (which we have not seen any days of just pure red this week will push us low enough to stay in the channel). Realistically we need a red day to finish down 1-2% in order to stay in this channel. And honestly we are kinda due for one. Im shocked that both today and yesterday stopped short of only about 0.5-1% down.

Supports intraday- 429.5 --&gt; 425 --&gt; 420.76 
Resistance intraday- 434.5 --&gt; 440 --&gt; breakout

Support-
-1%=427
-2%= 422.6
-3%= 418.3 

Resistance-
+1%=435.6
+2%= 439.8
+3% 444.17

Looking at the % up and down we can go its interesting that being up 2% tomorrow still keeps us in this bearish channel. Now mind you as time progresses the channel progresses with the chart so towards end of day tomorrow the upper limit of the channel will probably be closer to 438 or so...  i really am surprised we have not sold off yet to touch that 420 support area we saw this week... and i think maybe tomorrow could be the day it happens. 

Overall the chart and sentiment is still bearish. If and when we break this green dotted channel i will consider whether or not we are bullish. There is another resistance line up near 460 we have to break in order to see a full recovery breakout.",1

"BYND: Is it like TSLA or TLRY?I posted this on r/options first, thinking they would have helpful input but after waiting a whole 2 hours I got nothing. 

I have been short (via puts) on BYND since mid-August. My positions are May 2020 105p, 12/20 100p, 11/15 72.5p, and December 2020 42.5p. I bought in at different times and have rolled positions over this time. I have roughly 10% of my total account on this trade. I am currently up roughly 75% overall after today's drop.

My original thesis was that once the lock up ended there would be too many shares outstanding to hold its ridiculous valuation. I felt vindicated yesterday but with today's huge spike I am now questioning if the thesis has been broken. Hyped stocks like BYND are difficult to figure out. Do you think this is a TSLA situation where the ridiculously high valuation is here to stay or a TLRY situation where there will be a continued, epic downfall?

"AMZN: A Case Study on How a Tech Megacap Stalwart Falls From GraceSo I had time enough this past weekend to really analyze AMZN's most recent earnings and read between the lines.  What I found actually bodes well in terms of giving a leg up for smaller companies against all the macro headwinds, so bulls your poor bussys can have a rest.

Weirdly enough, some charting and TA served as a reliable second opinion in which to base off the what the fundamentals of the company are screaming laid out in the earnings report.

Hear me out and listen closely you fucking single digit IQ twatwaffles.  Maybe you'll actually come out in the green for once in your pathetic mom's basement dwelling life.  Pull up last weeks chart with the 8 EMA, 21 EMA, and 50 SMA overlaid with daily candles along with Bollingers and Heiken Ashis as reference so you can follow along.  It'll help to all make perfect sense and you'll get why a megacap stalwart can lose greater than $100B+ market cap in a single day, and it has nothing to do with inflation or Daddy Jpow ""Traitor of Fuk Yo Puts"" impending rate hikes of doom.

Now.




I‚Äôm not sure how up to date you are on the whole GameStop situation but Amazon is heading for bankruptcy and GameStop is now their biggest competitor.

Market cap isn‚Äôt there yet, but the company plan is on track.

Also Jeff Bezos is the target of every major corporation now.

Amazon CANT survive the next few years with their increasing bad reputation from littering and burning unused inventory to labor rights with their workers being violated.

Amazon sounds great, until you look underneath the hood and see all the parts are grinding and screaming.

GameStop is targeting Amazon to be the epicenter of e-commerce/gaming.

This GameStop earnings has been MASSIVELY anticipated and I believe Amazon will continue to develop a negative correlation to GameStop.

So what do they have to do with each other? Competitors and GameStops about to make the move with a bite to the jugular.",1

I explained last week my theory on why we will have quick movements of panic sells or bull runs, this happens because of the unusual increase in retail option buying activity and market makers hedging the contracts they wrote.  After this recent bull run I believe that we are in another period of consolidation before the next big move, this should last at least a few weeks.

Using the overall downtrend from the current year this shows that statistically what happened on Tuesday when SPY closed up at 461.6 was unusual and could not happen by chance alone.  Something at least had an influence on the markets that was unexpected.

**Predictions**

 So there really is nothing happening this week, which makes me think something is going to happen.  This has been the most hectic first quarter for the market in a long time.  I don't have any major events to speculate on this week, I am now looking at the bond markets. 

I remember talking about the bond markets 2 months ago saying an inverted yield curve could come in the next 5 months.  The bond markets are moving very fast however, this is not a good sign and the yield curve actually inverted last week with a 7.5bp negative spread in 10Y and 2Y government bonds.  

In 2001 when the yield curve inverted this was just about at the top of the market, when the yield curve inverted in 2008 there was still another 8 months before the market crashed.  This shows us that after the yield curve inverts it is only the final speculators that will prop up the market.  In 2001 it was obvious to many big funds that these trash companies were going for an IPO and then running 1000%, they knew that there was a bubble so when the yield curve inverted it was only a short period of time that this speculation crashed.  In 2008 though, the bubble was less obvious to many retail investors and funds, everyone was sure that the housing market was very solid and would forever be.  This caused many people to continue buying even through the obvious signs of a recession (the yield curve inverting).

The Federal Reserve is not dumb like we all think they are, they are just saying as much positive news as they possible can to try to keep a positive sentiment in the markets.  Unemployment cannot fall any lower... this could be the end of a growth cycle in the markets.  

Next few months will be bearish, this week we will have consolidation with a downward trend, I am not expecting any major movements.

Took out a loan for part of payment and put some on credit card as well last year. Paid off the CC very quickly with the money made from the house. Decided to take 1/3 of my loan money and put in Yang (because Fuck China) as I've traded Yang on and off for almost 2 years now. Began with 25 contracts, sold off some here and there either to cover margin call or take small profits because I'm fairly regarded and barely know how to dress myself in the morning.

 Currently up $10,665 and plan to pay off the loan even though it's only a 6% interest loan. Letting the last 10 contracts ride for a while and continuing the roller coaster ride. I already have money set aside for taxes as well, so all set there. It's hardly a gain porn to brag about, I'm just glad I didn't fuck up too bad because I have kids and shit.

"Let‚Äôs Buy NVDA on Monday!!!Congress is taking a vote next week on subsidizing semi conductor producers. If the vote passes stocks go up if the vote doesn‚Äôt pass stocks will go down because everyone is going to sell their bets. 

Nanci‚Äôs husband has already bought a ton of NVDA stock. That means that the vote will most likely pass. 

Now this is some crystal clear shit. Any boomer looking at the news can see this this trade which means that we will probably see a gap up on Monday for NVDA. 

However a lot of traders especially retirement fund institutions will probably wait until the vote comes through to buy into this stock which means that we aren‚Äôt technically too late to the party.

"9-12-22 Spy and Apple Daily Market AnalysisToday was the eve of CPI and easily was one of the weirdest trading days I have seen in a long time‚Ä¶ Intraday we watched overall volume trend extreme bull almost all day and despite that SPY struggled most of the day after it hit 411.73 during opening hour. Overall a really tough day to trade. Not only that but the VIX was rising most of the day (which to be expected with CPI tomorrow) and Apple hit 4.3%+ at one point and while Apple was going for ATH it seemed like SPY struggled almost all day. Definitely an interesting disconnected day. I traded until about 1130 and after that I refused to touch it. I didn‚Äôt really see any of my idea trade setups today either with the chop and random little dumps SPY would have.

I am going to keep this TA super short and simple and to the point.. why? Well because in the end while technical 100% matter and eventually tomorrow regardless of a big dump or a big pop SPY will find a key level to hug to but until then its just a guess. So lets look at some bigger ‚Äútargets.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ryn3jouoohn91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a30c097f2c88154cd936ba0ec57036828e36fda4

Currently credit Suisse released a report that they think CPI will be 7.9% and forecast/ consensus is 8.1% and Cleveland fed CPI nowcast which is usually pretty close is predicting 8.22%. Overall we should expect to see CPI hit that 7.9 to 8.2% range tomorrow in my opinion. 

So If we get a bullish CPI reading tomorrow then most likely we will see a big green open. The biggest openings we usually have from CPI at 1.4 to 1.8%. So on average we can say a 1.5% +/- opening regardless of reading. 

So if we get a good CPI reading tomorrow we should expect an opening closer to 417. Which would be pretty huge as this would put us right at key 417.3 level resistance. From there that will be a big fight that rages on. 

If we break through that resistance then we should look for 421.22 gap fill.  

However, if we get a bad CPI and expect a -1.5% opening we could see 404.8. This would be significant as it would put us back below key level support if 405.3.

Breaking below key 405.3 we could attempt a gap fill down to 400.86. 

Overall we can expect high volatility and a good CPI or a bad CPI in my opinion will guide the markets for the next week until FOMC..

Its hard to give a sold TA based prediction here but in my opinion good cpi + 75bps hike= rally‚Ä¶. Bad cpi and 75bps= rally‚Ä¶ bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump‚Ä¶ bad cpi and anything but 75bps hike= dump

Apple was an absolutely wild child today! Putting in the biggest green day its had since May 27th which was a 4%+ day. 

Apple also put in a heavy volume day today hitting 149% of its 30day average by close and 125% of its 10day average intraday range.

Apple broke through that major resistance from the early august top and that should continue to open up the upside for Apple and the rest of the market as long as CPI comes in strong tomorrow. 

We should expect a solid 3% +/- from Apple tomorrow with a possible range of 168.3 to 158.5. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not surprisingly we did see a small green day on the VIX today despite SPY in sell off mode. But that should be expected with CPI tomorrow and the increased ‚Äúfear‚Äù in the market. 

I know this post is not like most of my posts but honestly there is little reason to do a complete full blown technical based report when we know that CPI is going to break all norms and cause a bigger move. Tomorrow will be back to your normally scheduled TA‚Ä¶ 

The question is what will CPI be? What way will the markets move based on that CPI and what will markets do once they open? 

10% challenge-

As I had said today was one of those days where the way spy and the markets moved none of my ideal setups were hitting and if I had wanted to enter a trade I would have needed to break my rules. I was able to get 3 small trades in but that was about it. After about 1130 I just refused to trade it.

"TSLA Upcoming 4 for 1 Stock Split - An Elon Musk Twitter AnalysisLast year Elon Musk tweeted that ""Tesla stock price is too high imo"". Most people did not think too much of this as they thought he was referring to the then recent price action. However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.

https://preview.redd.it/gd2ixiclhz571.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755c06a09499b39b429a492e67190e41478d5372

He tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1. The 5 for 1 stock split was announced on 8/11.

[Tesla Announces a Five-for-One Stock Split | Tesla Investor Relations](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split)

So why do I think he is hinting at another split? There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).

https://preview.redd.it/blo3ms45iz571.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dbbf2cc89dcd10a9a04460c47c221f67ab92f99

Besides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.

While this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to ""Elon Musk, the 2nd"" which could be referring to the second stock split.

Furthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/bw87j61djz571.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbd74f28b426161b14ac8854c257a12e030564f4

He could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.

Assuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play. Last stock split announcement saw a 13%+ rise the day after as well as an 80%+ rise between the announcement and the actual split which was roughly two weeks later.

"Why Long AMD DDWorth reading the entire thing. Shows that even intel is worried about AMD catching up to intel.
https://www.techpowerup.com/256842/intel-internal-memo-reveals-that-even-intel-is-impressed-by-amds-progress
For the first time you have a CPU lineup that is competitive in all aspects, not only multicore, but also single core. Before, AMD might have only appealed to Budget and workstation users, AMD can appeal to every single part of the market. Leaks show that AMD is either on par, or even beating intel, at a much lower price point. Intel has slashed prices as a result. 

OEMs are starting to choose AMD over Intel, as they start seeing cost savings, at no impact to performance.

Laptops, a market traditionally locked down by intel, also facing a rise in AMD based devices.

Finally, servers. Intel makes most of their moolah on servers, where they can jack up the prices because there is no real competition. AMD has also come in, guns blazing, with server chips that are finally worth paying attention to. Google's stadia (game streaming service) is running off of AMD. Fixes to recent CPU vulnerabilities like meltdown, spectre, Rowhammer, all (significantly) affect Intel computing performance, something that enterprise customers care about a lot. AMD has been a lot more uptight about their security.

Intel has a market cap of 200 bil, while AMD has a market cap of 30 bil. AMD is definitely not going to 200 bil, but there is room for growth.

Concerns: P/E ratio of AMD is a little high, 121 vs Intel's 10. Could be a little overpriced, considering how a lot of investors realize the value in AMD. P/E ratio of 40 is normal in semiconductors.

However, considering room for future, explosive growth, I think it literally can't go tits up.

Long AMD, price target $60 (if you hold) I'll probably hold for 4 months.

"If you had a bad week take my debit spread on aapl your guaranteed to profitOkay so I'm not sure how your week went guy but here is a really safe play both the prices strike prices are itm underneath support 

So the play it's a weekly personally I don't really like playing these but this one is looking very promising I used the bid and ask price for both of these so you should get instantly filled probably can squeeze out a little more profit if your willing to wait to get filled.

So the play

Buy a aapl 9/21 call strike price is 215$ you should be expecting to pay around 9.35$ to get instantly filled 

Sell a aapl 9/21 call strike price is 217.50 ( support is 218$) to instantly sell it'll have to be at 7.00

Now you maximum net debit of 235$ this is the most you can lose 

If aapl is above 217.51 you'll make a whole 15$ 
If aapl is below 217.50 youll lose all your debit 235$ 

Now here is the beautiful part is aapl is above 220.50$ you make your maximum return of 265$ 

Because your 215$ will be worth 5.50$ at 200.50 
And the one you sold short (217.50)  will be a -50$ to you 550-50= 500 now take that 500$ and take away your debit of $235 and your return is 265 enjoy :)

"Weekly Risk Ranges for TSLA, AAPL, SPY, QQQ, IWM, GOOG, MSFT, AMZNIf this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.",0

"How to trade AMZN for less than the price of one shareNoticed a bunch of noob questions about options. Thought I would outline an example of a credit spread in the form of a bull put, for any of you that have mastered the FD and are looking to expand your playbook. 

Some benefits of the bull put spread: Your risk is defined and you will know going into the trade how much you can make or lose. Also, when putting on a credit spread, the credit goes into your account right away. This will be your max gain and your goal is to keep all or most of it. 

Why a bull put spread: Choose a stock that you are bullish on. Rather than being an option buyer, you are selling the expensive put option (the short leg) and buying the further out and cheaper put as a hedge (the long leg, without this it‚Äôs a naked put and your risk is unlimited).  

[Here is a credit spread on AMZN that I opened on May 8th.](https://imgur.com/a/LKdeiQi) I sold the May 18th 1600 put for $2,758 and bought the 1590 put for $2,279 as protection. I received the difference, or $478 as a credit to my account. 

Analyze and manage your position. If AMZN closes above 1600 this Friday, I will keep the entire credit. If AMZN is at $1595, I break even. If Amazon drops, the most I can lose is $522 (the difference of the spread 1600-1590 times 100 minus credit of 478). [Here is the P&amp;L chart for the position. ](https://imgur.com/a/1v2yVwG) Notice that theta is now your friend, as long as AMZN stays above 1600. 

And that‚Äôs how you can use options to trade Amazon and only risk a few hundred bucks. If this helps anyone, I can share some other trades and strategies. ",0

\-$6.6B 

\-361x average size. 

\-Largest trade since 12/17/2021  

I have no read other than to say that the next move, whichever way it goes, is likely to be strong and lasting.  Institutional volume like this is extremely rare.

$SPY bullish daily pattern spotted,1
"Please tell me you‚Äòre long on aaplFor the love of God I need some confirmation bias. You guys need to tell me you‚Äôre long on aapl so I know I‚Äôm inversing you. 

Juicy insider info: Tim apple himself told me they are not having supply chain issues but demand issues cuz their products have been insanely expensive for not much updates. Their products suck now for the average joe that was used to buy apple products for no apparent reason at all. 
A usable macbook air with up to date specs? $2000
The pro version? $3000
A new iPhone? $1500
A new iPad? $1000

Demand is drying up faster than your wifes box when she listens to your retard ass talking about your losses and blowing another account. Apple has put themselves in a corner. And there is no turning back. 

The new iPhone will not come out in September. They will postpone it and have only a low number of iPhones at release date so they can claim they can‚Äôt keep up with demand. Try to artificially pump up these numbers but unless in the past this time it won‚Äôt work out. It will blow up in their face. And the stock price will show it. 

Tldr: I‚Äôve accumulated around 300 put contracts so far. Any price any day will work

This is obviously not meant to be taken serious. But apple puts it is. Stay dangerous boys",1

"TSLA Options - profit from the dip?I'm a financially secure old guy who thought he could see the future, so I started buying TSLA in 2015. I now have about 1,000 shares at an average strike price of $330 (wish I had bought more, haha). Turns out, I was right about the future and I don't plan to sell a single share for at least five years, maybe ten. I'm also not prepared to buy a whole bunch more TSLA because I need diversity in my investments at my age and I am probably a bit overweighted with this single stock. BUT, I still want to play. In preparation for this playtime, I've opened a margin and options account with my broker.

Hypothetically, if I believed that TSLA stock would trade at or above $720 per share on or before May 14, 2021, and hypothetically, if I was willing to risk 100 of my 1,000 shares on that prediction, is there an options contract I could create to capitalize? I say hypothetically because I am in no way seeking investment advice and I would never put any of you in the awkward position of offering advice.

"Why Long AMD DDWorth reading the entire thing. Shows that even intel is worried about AMD catching up to intel.
https://www.techpowerup.com/256842/intel-internal-memo-reveals-that-even-intel-is-impressed-by-amds-progress
For the first time you have a CPU lineup that is competitive in all aspects, not only multicore, but also single core. Before, AMD might have only appealed to Budget and workstation users, AMD can appeal to every single part of the market. Leaks show that AMD is either on par, or even beating intel, at a much lower price point. Intel has slashed prices as a result. 

OEMs are starting to choose AMD over Intel, as they start seeing cost savings, at no impact to performance.

Laptops, a market traditionally locked down by intel, also facing a rise in AMD based devices.

Finally, servers. Intel makes most of their moolah on servers, where they can jack up the prices because there is no real competition. AMD has also come in, guns blazing, with server chips that are finally worth paying attention to. Google's stadia (game streaming service) is running off of AMD. Fixes to recent CPU vulnerabilities like meltdown, spectre, Rowhammer, all (significantly) affect Intel computing performance, something that enterprise customers care about a lot. AMD has been a lot more uptight about their security.

Intel has a market cap of 200 bil, while AMD has a market cap of 30 bil. AMD is definitely not going to 200 bil, but there is room for growth.

Concerns: P/E ratio of AMD is a little high, 121 vs Intel's 10. Could be a little overpriced, considering how a lot of investors realize the value in AMD. P/E ratio of 40 is normal in semiconductors.

However, considering room for future, explosive growth, I think it literally can't go tits up.

Long AMD, price target $60 (if you hold) I'll probably hold for 4 months.

"‚ÄúTSLA bubble is going to pop‚Äù~ Giga Berlin comes online in middle/fall of this year. Model Y will take 24 months to fully ramp and dominate EV sales by taking the single largest share. This is because the car would be superior in every way including manufacturing (single cast pieces for both front &amp; back), paint (Elon has stated it will be world‚Äôs most advance paint shop), range (due to better cells in the structural pack design - something Elon said would render everybody else uncompetitive long-term if they don‚Äôt copy Tesla‚Äôs design philosophy exactly), expanded Supercharging Network and in-car software. 
Giga Berlin will be producing cells (world‚Äôs most advance) and long-term be world‚Äôs biggest cell production plant (250 GW capacity as stated by Elon).  
The next car that would be produced (2022 year end) is a smaller sized vehicle for the biggest segment in Europe. This will keep ramping up until 2025. 

~ Giga Shanghai is going to contribute significantly towards 800k+ yearly guidance. Model Y will be the best selling car in its segment as Model 3 was in 2020. Tesla is building a factory in China to produce 10,000 Superchargers annually to for massive expansion. Companies like VW in China are done. They‚Äôre on their way out. Now only Tesla and Chinese automakers would compete. FSD sales are low in China but it will change this year when neural networks will be trained for Chinese roads. The only reason Tesla didn‚Äôt heavily focus on China was because they were busy with Autopilot re-write.

~ Latest FSD Beta already shows that Elon managed to somehow make the ‚Äúquantum shift‚Äù he boasted. Level 5 autonomy will be solved this year. Then it‚Äôs a matter of increasing reliability, handling corner cases and convincing regulators. It‚Äôs a game set match for Tesla. These sons of b‚Äôs did it. Eureka. Tesla will be hosting AI Day this year when Elon will be officially announcing world‚Äôs most powerful Supercomputer (exaFLOP level as he stated for video training). This will be offered as AWS like service as Elon stated. 

~ Even if stock goes down, funds will see it as opportunity and bring it right back up. No point arguing over P/E. This is not taking into account the Tesla Energy business (that‚Äôs rapidly growing every year and Tesla has recently acquired energy production licenses for countries in Europe), stimulus, subsidies and credits.",1

"TSLA ER FAIL SBUX ER WIN tldr; blew some of my education fund on Tesla ER, made it back plus more on Starbucks ERSo recently I had some funds for the remainder of my degree wired into my checking account. I let my pops know I was going to manage some of it myself, essentially swing trade it or let it sit in something passive for weeks at a time. In true WSB style, I was mostly in $TVIX and $UGAZ then slingin' some FD's here and there. I took a decent sized hit on $V ER, opened the day down a considerable amount. I went to work with the two remaining day trades I had and got in some pre earnings $TSLA FDs finishing the day roughly even, I was happy with it. Then $TSLA ER happened, quick pop up to 268, no buyers and down she went, nearly 12%. Opened the next day down even lower, I wasn't gonna fold, but I was a little more tense at this point. I went big on $TSLA calls shortly after, doubled my losses on $TSLA and took a decent chunk out of my newly acquired funds. Spent most of the rest of the day kind of sulking and feeling sorry for myself until I was sitting at my desk..10 minutes to closing bell. I noticed $SBUX ER was at the end of the day, a name I was very familiar with, had been following it for weeks, played Q3 ER of 2018 and made a considerable amount then as well. I took the remainder of what I had in my account after being down more than a couple grand and all-inned $SBUX. I sat there for minutes after the bell, it actually even moved down about 1.5% before jumping more than $6, a huge beat. I made seven grand the next morning selling shortly after the opening bell. 

I felt compelled to share my degeneracy with you folks here because if this story inspired even one of you, it'd be worth the fifteen minutes I spent typing it. I'll try to attach proof and everything here, thanks for being a part of my first real post on reddit. Happy FD'ing. 

tldr; lost a chunk of my educational funds on $TSLA ER, came back in a big way on $SBUX ER. 

p.s. would love a flair

I made two posts earlier regarding SPY's bottom. Believe I am not tech expert and I don't claim I know where the bottom is. But simple weekly graph proved it tried to reverse twice .

Below is the image and support lines I made two months back. We already hit 364 range. and it started rebound. If we pushed back, then the next support is around 315? Any other tech expert our there what do you think?

"Next week may start the next leg down on SPYSo I have been doing some research into options volume lately and I got two very interesting screenshots that got both taken on the same day:

As you guys can see after last Friday we got a huge spike in put volume for 350 puts expiring on August 19th.

Ofcourse this data can be a nothing burger and someone lost a lot of money or: Someone knows something something we don't and puts his money where his mouth is.

In conclusion: In noticed a huge spike in put option volume after last Friday's plummet and I wonder what this means.

"So what are the chances that CPI results tomorrow effect SPY?With the CPI (Consumer Price Index) results coming out tomorrow morning I'm wondering what that means for the S&amp;P500. 

Results are expected to show a rise in inflation of .4 % for January. Which will be 7.4% year over year. This is the highest pace since 1982. Now while the CPI is not a direct link to the stock market it can give insight into how FED will look to increase interest rates depending on demand. 

With current supply chain shortages across the states mixed with potentially bleak CPI results. I can see a potential pullpack and a very red day in general. 

The last CPI results came out on January 12th, the week or 2 following SPY fell around 45 dollars a share. Obviously not saying CPI directly caused this, put the timeline is interesting.

I grabbed a bunch of SPY puts today begrudgingly as I would much rather ride the retard bull. But I just feel like a tasty dip is looming.

"My final DD for AAPL. This is it.Let's weigh in the con and pros arguments for why AAPL will beat estimates and guide higher.
note: **I have been wrong 3/4 last predictions so please inverse me**



**Cons**:

Let's start with the facts. Broadcom, TI and Qualcomm reported earnings stating that expectations for modems have tapered recently due to the iphone. Please see QCOM's latest transcript here:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/top-iphone-suppliers-warn-of-slower-sales-ahead-of-apple-results?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_campaign=headline&amp;cmpId=yhoo.headline&amp;yptr=yahoo

Samsung also gave cautious guidance to OLED for mobile for 2018. In their CC, Samsung reported **23%** lower revenue than guidance for OLED for mobile phones.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Poor-iPhone-X-sales-weigh-down-Samsung-s-Oct.-Dec.-results

Furthermore, China mobile sales were very weak as compared to other years.
https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/MediaTek-expects-headwinds-in-China-mobile-market-in-2018





**Pros:**
1) 
The bloomberg article did not mention that Apple is now using intel modems (https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/31/apple-inc-may-have-wanted-to-use-intel-corps-modem.aspx). 
(https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/01/qualcomm-iphone-x-still-faster-than-intel/)
In fact during intel's CC, they've reported a huge growth in their mobile business unit.

2) 
The Korean Won was very strong this quarter due to bank of korea raising rates and growing peace between North and South. This headwind can account for 5% of the 23% lower revenue in OLED for mobile. Furthermore, we don't know exactly how much of the OLED goes to Apple although Samsung has exclusive rights to make the OLEDs for the Iphone X. 

Cautious guidance can be explained by other OLED mfgs such as LG's.

Therefore, it is my conclusion that Iphone X sales (in units) have moderated about 10%, but not as bad as other analysts have predicted. However, in revenue ($ USD) due to the weak dollar, Apple may have in fact beaten guidance despite the lukewarm sales.  

3) 
Latest Foxconn sales have shown a huge increase in revenue. Mark Hibben (Seeking Alpha) attributes the growth to the Iphone X sales solely.
https://i.imgur.com/ZXL1b8o.png

4) Apple's services will grow by more than 20% YoY. This is where the real growth is coming from. http://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/apple-siri-now-active-500m-devices/

5) Taxes and the 350B spending spree. This is self-explanatory. I believe that Apple has been using this quarter as an experimental period where they want to take the next GIANT leap in progress - just like what Mark Zuckerberg has done. They both know that they can get away with it - which is totally fair. Please see my previous post to cite for your research: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7txxw7/isnt_it_to_apples_benefit_to_lower_aapl_to/
   


6) Qorvo, an Apple supplier, has seen a bit weaker revenue but expects encouraging growth in later half of 2018:



7) TSMC reported 10nm revenue in the 2 consecutive quarters of 2.55E9  USD. Since virtually all 10nm goes to Apple at the moment, we see 2.55E9/($26 cost for A11)*1E-6 &lt;= (upper bound) 98M IPhone X sold. Although this is an upper bound, this is way way higher than the estimates calling for 15-20M.

*With Apple‚Äôs softer holiday sell-through being well reported over the past several weeks and QRVO‚Äôs stock already having declined about 20% from its highs in November, investors look to have already largely factored in QRVO‚Äôs lighter guidance, with the company‚Äôs shares remaining relatively flat in after-hours trading.
Also likely helping to support QRVO‚Äôs share price is its indication of ‚Äúrecent developments with mid/high-band PADs and Phase 6 design wins‚Äù, which include mid/high-band and low-band integrated PAD modules.  The company also sampled a custom mid/high-band PAD to an additional tier-one smartphone OEM. These mid/high-band PAD are significant as it has been the lack of high-performance BAW filter shipments that have recently weighed on its gross margins, particularly as it previously earned a high volume low-band PAD design with its largest customer that used SAW filters instead of the firm‚Äôs BAW designs.
Update: The stock has now staged quite an impressive turnaround, surging by $6.43, or almost 9%, at $78.20, and at one point almost 10% higher this evening. One thing that may be helping the company are remarks by management on the call that later this year, it expects to see the biggest-ever content gains in Apple products that it has ever seen for its wireless parts.**
https://www.barrons.com/articles/qorvo-stock-already-reflects-weak-apple-results-says-drexel-1517437350?mod=hp_RTA&amp;




**Conclusion**:  Analysts have been deceptively scooping your shares, and Apple is using this time to experiment and take the risks needed to still be innovative in an era where value and growth are perceived to not go hand in hand.

"Some basic TSLA Tech Analysis for you Smooth-Brained ApesSo, TSLA, along w/ the rest of the Tech stocks is on a downward trajectory, which leads to the obvious question: When does it stop so I can buy in and maximize my upside potential?

I took a look at some historical Moving Averages to get an idea of how far this may go and my initial conclusions are below:

1. Crashed through the 50-day SMA on 21 Feb and has stayed &gt;10% below since.  This MA has historically been TSLA's support level and staying below leads me to think it may be here a while.
2. 100-day SMA is the next logical support level, which is $625 so I'll be watching closely to see if the downward trajectory continues at the same rate, or starts to level out as it approaches that 100-day SMA support level.

The stock is at $688 now so that 100-day SMA isn't really far off and it could rebound sharply so set your alerts and/or limits, raid your wife's boyfriend's wallet, and hang on for a fun, and potentially lucrative opportunity.

This is where we are on the 15minute chart. We have officially broken outta the bear channel from April 21st to present. However, we have not broken the 15min bear resistance line from March 29th that puts us near 442. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jbazyth4sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f99ea0758f76382a45c3751af5cd49d52f8a9d8

One thing bulls need to be careful of is that we now see a TRIPLE top formed on the 15minute chart at 430 from March 26th, March 28th and today. We rejected pretty hard there and have fallen pretty hard from that high after hours now. There is definitely question whether we continue rally tomorrow or retrace. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/is3wg815sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b11d9e61cd40a3f27d83fc2a069cd1def991696

Current daily chart you can see we have NOT broken the bear channel there YET. We actually perfectly rejected the top resistance line much like April 21st. This resistance line also happens to be the Daily 20ema too. 

Bulls are going to need to see a clean green day tomorrow and try to close around 437 to confirm a breakout and step far away from this bear channel. 

However, if the bears are able to keep up this after hours rally (bear rally) then we may see a nice red open and test support down close to 423 and even 420 tomorrow. As long as bears can open this red and keep it under 428 tomorrow they maintain the integrity of the bar channel but will need a pretty red day to get low enough that Friday doesn‚Äôt break trend. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that may help the bears though is the fact the VIX went from a high of 29.42 today all the way down to 24.94 at its lows before it bounced off that 25 level. 

This is the first time the VIX has been touched below 25 since April 22nd. As I have been saying the current 3 week long vix trend has been between 26.5 to 36.5 with a mean of 29 to 32.6. Now that we have broken lower we could see a return to the previous mean levels of 25 to 18.7 before we had the massive sell off. However, after what could be argued as a massive over reaction to the FOMC announcement and press conference we very well COULD see a reversion to mean tomorrow on VIX and SPY. That‚Äôs the way I am playing the rest of the week. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1jk3a7a7sjx81.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a29c672c98c9fd1541cd200f2ffadf7468b59fd

As you can see Apple has broken one bear channel BUT has not fully broken the lower highs yet as you can see below. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ce4l2fq7sjx81.png?width=803&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2c29a07101d5832fd44a1fa353229aecbc15de6

Much like SPY apple is RIGHT at is channel resistance line and will need to see a pretty significant move downward over night which it has done after hours to lock this bear channel in. If bears can keep this under 165.7 at open and maintain a red day tomorrow they should hold bear channel integrity and look for a retest of the daily 8ema closer to 161.6 and eventually the daily 200ema near 158.25.

However, if bulls get the breakout we are gonna look to test that resistance peak from April 21st at 171.5.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/faqx6td8sjx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e8a6f677606aaaa2a67be578af078a9f6ea8fc4

As you can see QQQ too maintains a bear channel. With a rejection of its daily 20ema and the bear channel with a after hours retrace. If the bears can maintain a high of 328 (which is also a major support/ resistance line) tomorrow then they will look to push red and test lower supports of 323 and 317. 

Bulls will look to break through the daily 20ema of 332 and eventually test the daily 50ema of 342.

So whats the theme here? We had a hell of a bull rally today but we are not outta the bear woods yet. And even IF we see a short term bull run we are still on all tickers a overall bear channel. I would equate this to a bear market rally. I don‚Äôt know how big it will be or when it will stop but we soon will find out. There is a case to be made that we are going to break down again tomorrow and will end up back at the lows of the week before Fridays close. However, bulls have an opportunity to break some highs and close a green week after 4 red weeks in a row. As long as SPY closes above 412 it will break its 4 red week trend right now. However, it does not mean it breaks the bear trend. I would again call this a bear market rally. 

10% challenge-

Man big oof here. Today is one of those days where you watch your account go from massive loss to big profits. I took advantage of the FOMC run and scalped tons of profits today. I watched my account around 11am this morning go from negative two times weekly profit goal to now close of market being up one times weekly profit goal. 

Sometimes when we are facing red we have to keep fighting but we have to be smart about how we fight. This morning and really all day 0dte was not paying well and was just burning me so I made a switch to 2dte and they paid like crazy. Now that I am in profits for the week I will look to take some risk off tomorrow and Friday and try to end with 2x weekly profits if I can.

So overall this is what I carried over night last night.

\-I close the MES cashed secured puts for 5% before the JPOW rally (regrets but I took a calculated risk as rallying $10 we coulda easily fallen $10 and with the losses I was at I could NOT risk my account with that drop).

\-EOD closed the 432C for 60% profits

\-before JPOW I closed the 421c  for -52% and the 423C for -70%. Of course I had no way of knowing we were going to see 430 and I wanted to salvage what I could. I fully anticipated the best bull case of 425. Which barely woulda breaken those even but with theta eating 0dte up like crazy I had to exit when I could. It was quite a large loss and that‚Äôs what I found back from all day. 

That‚Äôs the hard part we have to make calculated risks. I should have just closed last night at -32% and -55% but I expected a morning rally but that didn‚Äôt happen so I took a bigger loss. However, had the morning dump been a morning rally I woulda got paid huge on my risk. In the end we have to stop letting losers run so long. I still struggle on this and especially in this wacky market I struggle.

Currently this is what im holding‚Ä¶ So my goal for those 59dte CALLS were to hold till 430 maybe 440. But I expected a bit of a slower run up. I think 430 could be our top and at 50% I felt I needed to take profits now. 

So I am now repositioning for the next drop. End of day today I purchased a overnight put 2dte 428P and I also picked up some 382p (15 delta) 57dte puts. My goal with these is to add one put for every $2.5 we go over 430. So I will next add at $432.5, $435, etc.   
 

I have no doubt that we will revisit within the next 60dte 400 range. And when we do I will look to make similar profits like I did off the 60dte calls.

Took a gamble on the hyperwheel and loss‚Ä¶ as you can see the Buy and hold is far exceeding my hyperwheel return. However, I have no contracts currently open so I am risk off right now. As I mentioned I was not comfortable with not knowing if we would dump or rocket after JPOW. I had a quick thought to throw them back on at 415 but by time I could think about it the opportunity was gone.

I will watch tomorrow and Friday to see how we end up and decide if I readd my CSP before next week or wait till after CPI on Wednesday.",0

"6-24-22 SPY Weekly TAWell that was an interesting day! We had two realistic scenarios that could have happened today one of them being the gap up over 380 followed by 390 gap fill and they ran her right to 390.08 in the last seconds of the day. 

Today was a goofy day to say the least. We had some great momentum going until about 1015 am then we just died. We had the Roe vs. Wade decision today that I believe took some steam out of the markets and we had a Biden presser. We traded flat from 10am until 245pm when we finally started making a move upward. 

https://preview.redd.it/9g6lg9bgum791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b769ec7486d8a4004ea8f9b58ef7eb9905bd452

Now the one weird thing about the EOD today is that we actually saw a pretty significant pop in the VIX AND we saw SPY pop hard at the same time. While its not a perfect correlation VIX to SPY usually they inverse eachother. Today was odd in many ways. IF you look at the 15min chart we actually had one of the strongest trend days I have seen in weeks where we never even closed a candle below the 15min 8EMA however they held this pinned down for almost 4.5 hours before we finally moved upward and it wasn‚Äôt until the last really 10 minutes that we saw a true pop. 

&amp;#x200B;

We broke through the red channel today so lets get rid of that noise on the chart‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/pcva4t0ium791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8929a71f5b0e16e7a6313d7a8c5561c6a2cbb3b4

We have quite a few things developing on this daily chart. Now we FINALLY filled the June 13th gap EOD there. Which would make me believe we are about to fill the June 10th 401.44 gap next week. 

If you look at the daily I have drawn with blue dotted lines a rising wedge that is forming. This is a reversal/ bearish pattern. It gives us room to see 392 on Monday if we are obeying that resistance line. It also give us room to see 380 support test Monday to fill some of the gap we left on the daily chart today. 

https://preview.redd.it/x1v8t0lium791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdce5cc1151ab394d5f29d00af09e3d4ef8f488b

The weekly gap was filled today too when we hit 390 EOD. 

Bull scenario- What I am seeing develop is a few things here that could be bullish. In general SPY doesn‚Äôt leave gaps for too long on the daily and now that one has been filled we might fill the next which gives us the though of 402 next week. This rising wedge could actually become a smaller bull channel. If it turns into a bull channel (we would need to break through 392.5 to confirm) then we might see a run to 402-404 next week. 401.44 is the exact gap fill and the tan bear channel gives resistance of 403.5 for Monday and 402.5 for Tuesday. Also looking at the weekly now that the gaps been filled and arguably the weekly 200ema is support we should see that black bear channel broken and see the red bear channel tested near 403.5 during the week. 

Bear case scenario- despite a pretty big 3.18% green day today there was a severe lack of momentum for 80% of the day. However, we had some very bullish volume. We can use that rising wedge as a possible rejection zone for Monday which gives us potential to see 392 before we reject. There is also a history that once a gap is filled the price action will hard reverse. The biggest bear case I am watching currently is that we died right at 390 EOD. IT filled the gap on the daily but that 390 is also a major resistance zone on the weekly. It is possible that the previous major support zone will now become a major resistance and we will see a gap down Monday to stay within that black channel (383 is the top) and then we will head back down to retest the weekly 200ema near 363. 

https://preview.redd.it/4tgsx2ajum791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95753666dad49c8c32cd398701f47f21e5f0c0d0

Now the VIX is something im trying to get a good grasp on. We have clearly been unwinding since last week but its been very choppy. We also saw a pretty aggressive EOD pop on the VIX that was out of the normal. There is a case that since UVXY spiked first (based off VIX futures) we actually might have some people going long on puts next week and we could see a bigger red week next week. Based off that black support line we shouldn‚Äôt see VIX break below 25.5 next week before we start our ascent back upwards. 

If VIX sees 25 Monday and we gap fill 402 that could cause the VIX reversal and SPY reversal I was mentioning above. 

10% challenge-

This was actually a really great week for me. I made a REALLY bad trade on UVXY today though. I had entered at a perfect time and almost immediately saw 25% profits. However, I believe so much in the fact that the VIX was going to break 27 and SPY was going to see 380 that I held and didn‚Äôt lock profits. This was a big mistake. I did not see UVXY rocketing EOD like that before power hour and being so far OTM and 0dte I got wrecked hard and fast. Tough loss there. 

Overall this week my indicators worked really well for me and I was very patient in my entries. I was discussing this in my server EOD but I have been considering whether or not I want to remove VIX from my entry requirements. Currently I have a momentum indicator for SPY, VOLSPD, VOLD and VIX all on the 1 minute that I use to enter a trade. When they are all 4 bullish or bearish (aligned) I enter. However, I am seeing lately that VIX is not aligning much with SPY anymore and I am wondering if I am limiting myself. Today I kind of put that to the test EOD. I entered a 0dte during power hour based off volatility switch showing a trending state, spy breaking resistance on the 15min chart and the SPY, VOLSP and VOLD 1 min charts all being bullish. The play hit 100% for me and would have been 200% had I not sold. If I listened to VIX I would never have entered that trade. I wonder if in this market if volume is the true king and if I should listen to SPY and volumes only. I may do some experimenting next week.

note: **I have been wrong 3/4 last predictions so please inverse me**



**Cons**:

Let's start with the facts. Broadcom, TI and Qualcomm reported earnings stating that expectations for modems have tapered recently due to the iphone. Please see QCOM's latest transcript here:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/top-iphone-suppliers-warn-of-slower-sales-ahead-of-apple-results?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_campaign=headline&amp;cmpId=yhoo.headline&amp;yptr=yahoo

Samsung also gave cautious guidance to OLED for mobile for 2018. In their CC, Samsung reported **23%** lower revenue than guidance for OLED for mobile phones.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Poor-iPhone-X-sales-weigh-down-Samsung-s-Oct.-Dec.-results

Furthermore, China mobile sales were very weak as compared to other years.
https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/MediaTek-expects-headwinds-in-China-mobile-market-in-2018





**Pros:**
1) 
The bloomberg article did not mention that Apple is now using intel modems (https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/31/apple-inc-may-have-wanted-to-use-intel-corps-modem.aspx). 
(https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/01/qualcomm-iphone-x-still-faster-than-intel/)
In fact during intel's CC, they've reported a huge growth in their mobile business unit.

2) 
The Korean Won was very strong this quarter due to bank of korea raising rates and growing peace between North and South. This headwind can account for 5% of the 23% lower revenue in OLED for mobile. Furthermore, we don't know exactly how much of the OLED goes to Apple although Samsung has exclusive rights to make the OLEDs for the Iphone X. 

Cautious guidance can be explained by other OLED mfgs such as LG's.

Therefore, it is my conclusion that Iphone X sales (in units) have moderated about 10%, but not as bad as other analysts have predicted. However, in revenue ($ USD) due to the weak dollar, Apple may have in fact beaten guidance despite the lukewarm sales.  

3) 
Latest Foxconn sales have shown a huge increase in revenue. Mark Hibben (Seeking Alpha) attributes the growth to the Iphone X sales solely.
https://i.imgur.com/ZXL1b8o.png

4) Apple's services will grow by more than 20% YoY. This is where the real growth is coming from. http://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/apple-siri-now-active-500m-devices/

5) Taxes and the 350B spending spree. This is self-explanatory. I believe that Apple has been using this quarter as an experimental period where they want to take the next GIANT leap in progress - just like what Mark Zuckerberg has done. They both know that they can get away with it - which is totally fair. Please see my previous post to cite for your research: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7txxw7/isnt_it_to_apples_benefit_to_lower_aapl_to/
   


6) Qorvo, an Apple supplier, has seen a bit weaker revenue but expects encouraging growth in later half of 2018:



7) TSMC reported 10nm revenue in the 2 consecutive quarters of 2.55E9  USD. Since virtually all 10nm goes to Apple at the moment, we see 2.55E9/($26 cost for A11)*1E-6 &lt;= (upper bound) 98M IPhone X sold. Although this is an upper bound, this is way way higher than the estimates calling for 15-20M.

*With Apple‚Äôs softer holiday sell-through being well reported over the past several weeks and QRVO‚Äôs stock already having declined about 20% from its highs in November, investors look to have already largely factored in QRVO‚Äôs lighter guidance, with the company‚Äôs shares remaining relatively flat in after-hours trading.
Also likely helping to support QRVO‚Äôs share price is its indication of ‚Äúrecent developments with mid/high-band PADs and Phase 6 design wins‚Äù, which include mid/high-band and low-band integrated PAD modules.  The company also sampled a custom mid/high-band PAD to an additional tier-one smartphone OEM. These mid/high-band PAD are significant as it has been the lack of high-performance BAW filter shipments that have recently weighed on its gross margins, particularly as it previously earned a high volume low-band PAD design with its largest customer that used SAW filters instead of the firm‚Äôs BAW designs.
Update: The stock has now staged quite an impressive turnaround, surging by $6.43, or almost 9%, at $78.20, and at one point almost 10% higher this evening. One thing that may be helping the company are remarks by management on the call that later this year, it expects to see the biggest-ever content gains in Apple products that it has ever seen for its wireless parts.**
https://www.barrons.com/articles/qorvo-stock-already-reflects-weak-apple-results-says-drexel-1517437350?mod=hp_RTA&amp;




**Conclusion**:  Analysts have been deceptively scooping your shares, and Apple is using this time to experiment and take the risks needed to still be innovative in an era where value and growth are perceived to not go hand in hand.

"NVDA DD, LongHere's some good DD, been missing some nice DD


$NVDA is a gaming company. It has been since its inception. Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


[Here is the google drive with the model paper, and position proof, updated whenever I update them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h2cTeiNRP07K8-2Wn4lYyQtbB_go2HGB?usp=sharing)


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.

* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.


* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.


* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.


Price Target:


* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. 


What I think:


I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&amp;D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.


I have +1 Jan 19 NVDA $350 Call that I purchased for $8.30. Proof in drive. Why not investing more? I don't want a lot of exposure and I'm poor.


TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity. ",1

If i lose this then fuck it at least by May it will happen and not in 20 fucking minutes.  

Long story short... whats your thoughts on where SPY will be come May? Really banking on at least 285, any other guesses?

"11-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisWell the bulls came out swinging for about 15minutes and then after that the bears were in control all day. I called out this morning based on volatility that we could see 395 today‚Ä¶ we had such a massive gap after that 399.2 support that it was the natural place we should move to. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qnwo7sqggr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abf2ba3a3f27976acebf648f553204adc7d7f687

Interestingly enough‚Ä¶ after 393.7 support if we lose that volatility wise we have no real established support area until all the way down to 373.7. Could we be headed for a CPI gap fill over the next few weeks? 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe we have quite the bear case forming here on spy with a smaller bull potential. But lets take a look at what we have here now‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqlsg5qhgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=203546bf0ee653d203b63ec303e2c475d05f5080

Looking at SPY daily here I called out on Friday that I suspected that tiny gravestone doji double top rejection at 402.4 would open up the downside for today and I was correct. I should have played weekend swing puts but I was happy to sit cash as the weekends are pretty unpredictable as of late. 

Bear case- today we opened red and attempted to retake the daily 200ema however was unable to, we broke the 3+ week long daily rising wedge pattern and we closed below the daily 8ema for the first time since the day before CPI. 

Bull case- despite the rejection and closing under the daily 8 and 200ema we did bounce pretty hard off the key support range of 395 to 395.5 today. We are still maintaining that key lower support range of this consolidation pattern that SPY has been in since November 11th. 

For me this breakdown shows that we have a potential to retest 390.1 support and potentially even lower depending on what JPOW says on Wednesday and depending on what all the economic data comes in at. I am bearish until we touch 390.1‚Ä¶ If we touch and bounce off 390.1 again then I am seeing a nice consolidation channel from 390.1 to 402.5 and will play it at such. However if we break through and close under 390.1 then I am looking for at minimum the gap fill at 381.2. 

Key support- 396 -&gt; 392.6 -&gt; 390.1

Key resistance- 399.2 -&gt; 402.4

&amp;#x200B;

Much of the same case here on futures breaking that rising wedge. However, futures is still holding over one of the key support levels of 3970. If we see futures lose 3955 then I would feel confident in a 3910 retest of support. However, if futures can break back over 4000 we can start talking about a retest of 4020 and then 4040.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3v7aupuigr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f55ad1ead9b49c0b10d8422a4714ce3f91b96ae

Tesla has the biggest bearish case of them all in my opinion when we look at the daily chart. We had that green support line that was 3 days long until today. That line was broke through today we also failed to even reach the falling wedge resistance line before we retraced. With this gravestone doji closing at Fridays candle body support of 182.9 this should open up some pretty large downside tomorrow. The only real bullish case I see for Tesla right now is that it did recover and close back over its daily 8ema EOD. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sb5nbidjgr2a1.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e956cfe851e89a8798726f581aa3fa6c67216bc

Last week I shared with you guys that tesla had a pretty uniformed drop and recovery cycle. I was seeing that we were averaging a drop of about 6.8 days for 17.82% while the recovery was about 4.5 days of 12.08%. 

With todays new short term high we officially put in our 4th recovery day and reached 13.4% total recovery. 

If we are trusting this trend that has been playing out for 3 months now that means we should expect about a 7day sell off of about 17.82% which puts Tesla at 154.9 around December 7th. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1l8qyrtjgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7af3c1395a4edfaa0271107bcd192d0826b9512

If we play out the falling wedge here by December 7th we could see 148.7 which is a total drop of 21.2%. However if we play out the % drop of 17.82% but not the number of days it took to get there we could see by November 30th (2 days) a touch of the red support line at 154.5. 

Realistically I would look for a test of support near 148-155 in the next 4-7 trading days. Biggest support to break through though will be that 166.2 level. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nb5x4lckgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=060a5fcfcccf160399b111c5fc56bbba73474559

I don‚Äôt love post weekly charts so early in the week but we did break through the blue resistance line of this current downward trend today. However we immediately rejected and hard rejected off the weekly 200ema. Key support for this weekly timeframe is 180.1. This current bear channel (thick red support line) gives us intraweek support of 154 and next week support of 152. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i1ypnmtngr2a1.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b49e2fa1fe3ece40f4c34f686445047bba1158d

As much as I was looking for that 19.7 touch this week it appears that as of now we may not get it. We officially closed over the daily 8ema for the first time since October 14th. We are still in this bear channel though and its not quite time to get super excited but this is not a bad time in my opinion to start adding to some 30-60dte put positions. 

**$5k/ 10% challenge-** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ur18t0hlgr2a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dccb7cb11673a4f1a2eacd4b6a306c09af6f1a16

Was able to get a nice put scalp in this morning for the $5k challenge. Still haven‚Äôt quite been able to get any good big scalp wins but I also don‚Äôt want to stretch these plays out. This is one of those times where if I had a standard position size (usually $2000 for me) I would sometimes hold a little longer but with this larger bigger $5000 position I am more apt to quickly take profits and to take the first hit of profits. 

This is where the emotional side of trading comes in. 

**Daily log-** 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall not a bad day and a great way to start the week off. Almost love starting the week off with a nice green day. Scalps were on fire today even if I closed them all early AF only for them all to 3-4x right after‚Ä¶ but profit is profit! 

Some struggles with the level to level plays this morning. The first SPY put I played the bounce off 399.2 support however it was a fake bounce and broke down pretty quickly and I got out. I was just unfortunately too early on that first Tesla put and got stopped out before it saw green. 

Not a bad day.

At $88 a share, we‚Äôre looking at massive upside. And instead of buying GME at $83, why not buy something that actually has some long term value? Oh and did I mention it‚Äôs one of the most shorted stocks this month? [https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks)

As our savior Elon Tweeted today : ‚ÄúI am become meme, destroyer of shorts.‚Äù

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993)

Let‚Äôs make him proud.

Ok, now for some DD so you guys know I‚Äôm not talking out of my ass.

# Fundamentals:

Their latest ER:

**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**

**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**

Server revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible because that means they are actually going toe to toe with the big boys like IBM.

Massive increase in guidance. They‚Äôre **expecting 37% growth** this year.

So why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let‚Äôs be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.

Obviously, we‚Äôd prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you‚Äôre gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, ‚Äúhey we have too many orders and we can‚Äôt keep up sorry, we‚Äôll get it to you ASAP‚Äù

Imagine thinking this company isn‚Äôt going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.

Our queen, Lisa Su, said ‚Äúthere will be added capacity‚Äù in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they‚Äôll be good to go. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.

**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**

Intel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!

**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.

**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.

# Technicals:

For those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.

We really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we‚Äôre basically there right now.

In addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47

For more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.

# Conclusion/TLDR:

My point is that more than half of you fuckers run AMD in your machine anyway and the other half is waiting for their stimulus check to buy the new Ryzen series. The new investors here are all sad from GME, but now it‚Äôs time to put your big boy pants on and get into something that has some real value behind it. You got questions? Leave em in the comments and I‚Äôll answer.

This is a colossal shakeup in the industry -- but I can hear doubters shouting ""but Intel's entrenched in the server space! Performance dosen't matter because of partnerships!""

This means that they are delivering a lot of model 3s and that you should by some August 3rd $450 calls

"$1M in AMZN stock in 1998 would be worth over $1B todayIf some rich ass doctor or lawyer in 1998 had the balls to buy $1M worth of post-IPO AMZN stock, they would have purchased around 556,000 shares (~$1.75 each). Today, those shares would be worth over $1B.

If such a thing happened (and maybe it did), then this person would likely be the first and only person to have become a billionaire solely through non-institutional investing.

"My thoughts on AMDThroughout the past year, I have been researching computer parts to build my own PC, and I‚Äôd say around just half a year ago, PC building subreddits and people in general recommended both AMD and INTC cpus for building a PC. Each had their pros and cons. However since the release of the new line of AMD CPUs, Id say for 95% or more of PC builds, people are recommending AMD cpus. In addition, they are gaining traction in the medium/high end gpu market. Before the release of their Ryzen 5700 gpu line, their medium/high end gpus were kind of a joke and people stuck with Nvidia. Now, AMDs top gpu (5700 XT) is a competitor with the 2070 super card and AMD in the CPU AND GPU market offers same or better performance compared to Intel and Nvidia at a MUCH better price. Especially seen in the CPU market.",1

"Chart Voodoo and Dark Rituals - LULU &amp; NVDAI'm back with another installment of sinister magic. This week I learned a little bit about farming and the income I could make from it. One word: Ostriches. Raising these bad boys is super profitable. Eggs, leather, meat... Sell it all, just like the natives of old. So I asked my uncle if I could buy a few and raise them on his farm. We're in business. From here on out it's ostrich blood, boys. I broke out the old ouija board and drew some charts. You all know the process by now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to admit I conjured up this chart voodoo last week, but it's turned out pretty well. We got LULU and NVDA on spotlight. I like these bad boys because they are meme stocks and have high growth potential. If you get into these trades now, you won't see max profit potential, but I still predict continuation of these trends.

&amp;#x200B;

LULU broke out from a bull flag and is fast on its way to $192. The lines indicate $181 would have been a good entry point, $179 as stop loss and $192 as target.

I got bad news for you all. NVDA is going south for a while. NVDA failed its breakout from an ascending triangle in March and is now forming a bearish flag pattern. The lines indicate that a good entry was $162, stop loss at $168, and a target of $140 (aggressive, I know).

"AMD News is priced in...I literally know nothing about AMD and am pretty tech illiterate so take my advice with a grain of salt. I‚Äôm seeing two camps around AMD: those who know technology who think AMD is going to be super hot and give intel a run for their money and those who think it‚Äôs ‚ÄúpRiCeD iN‚Äù already.

This reminds me a lot of Dominos Pizza to be honest... Back at the tail end of the financial crisis, some friends of mine saw that Dominos (DPZ) had finally come to their senses and changed how they did business- they turned their production process and recipes on their head in order to actually make a product that people wanted to buy and weren‚Äôt just ‚Äúsatisfied that they bought a cheaper alternative to better pizza‚Äù. Except for the pizza part, does this Sound familiar? 

So anyway, DPZ had gone from $4 to $11 as they went from near bankrupt to actually competitive with a good product. We bought in at about $11 once the product was getting good feedback. We SOLD it at $13-14 after scalping a 20% gain. We figured the good news and the improved product was pRiCeD iN already, we had made our money, and the stock had essentially tripled in a year. 

Whoa were we wrong. Every time the stock doubled or tripled we said it was priced in already and there was no point in buying it back because the trend was likely over soon because pizza is competitive and there is no moat and well funded competitions...

Anyway- this situation just reminded me of what I‚Äôm seeing arguing about AMD. If they really are making a better product than the competition (I‚Äôm too stupid to understand if that‚Äôs true or not), ride the freaking wave.",0

"QQQ and SPY will be down over 3% tomorrow because of paper hands but you can use that to your advantageErasing today‚Äôs losses was a bad sign; it shows that the market makers are preparing for big a drop, and are on an acceleration/continuation trend downwards for the near future. Coincidentally almost exactly a year ago the same nightly nosedives intraday saves started

Most days aren‚Äôt actually green intraday and most money is made holding after hours/between days, and most major movements occur overnight because it‚Äôs easier to move large sums of trading hours money with smaller sums of futures/ah/pm money, and for anyone who pays very close attention to what hedges are doing you‚Äôll usually notice a consistent strategy. They sell puts on a sharp red day (Yesterday, today‚Äôs morning), and then cause a reversal so they can buy back those puts for cheap. They do this with calls too and that was the main purpose of today‚Äôs rapid rise‚Ä¶ 

If anyone sees where this is going yet, there were a lot of calls sold and puts bought back today. Today‚Äôs opening was an example of hedges becoming afraid they lose control over their shorts, and we lost 5 dollars on SPY in 20 minutes, and the day they actually lose control will be a shorting onslaught for them.

This relates to tomorrow because they would love to buy back the calls they sold for as little as possible, and by buying back puts general losses on the market don‚Äôt hurt as much. Todays vertical rises/ falls made option volatility very high and the high volatility raised prices which need to be torn down by a huge gap down overnight into a slide tomorrow. My guess is 2-3% but could be more, no one will know till pre market tomorrow.


Hence doing the opposite of what market makers want their prey to do should increase your profits even more. (Calls on a v/ red day, puts on a v/ green day) Also, doing the opposite may trigger a squeezes in derivatives which can really make you crazy crazy tenders ifykyk.",1

Short TSLA,1
"Why GME is the next TSLA. The case for LONG GME.First off, congrats to everyone that made bank from that price action this week. It has been a refreshing change from all of the loss porn. Even though my tits remain jacked for the rest of the week and the short term momentum, I want to discuss my thoughts on GME, why it is a great LONG play based on fundamentals, and why I think it will be the next TSLA. 

First, these two companies have some essential similarities for my comparison

1. They have a huge retail following and remarkably loyal/enthusiastic investor base
2. Charismatic, passionate, and incredibly successful leaders in Cohen and Elon
3. The companies are developing new tech to be leaders in a mostly untapped market 

My comparison on the fundamental side will focus on current day GME as compared to TSLA in 2017.

TSLA (2017)                  GME (today)

Market cap                           71b                                    10b               

Share Price                            70                                      141

Revenue                                 11b                                    6.1b

EPS                                       -2.37                                    -5.25

Current Assets                       6.5b                                    2.6b

Current Liabilities                 7.6b                                    1.3b

Long term debt                     11.6b                                  40m (yes, million)

&amp;#x200B;

So, looking at these numbers they are not perfect, but I think the same thing ultimately held TSLA back that will hold GME back from a fundamental perspective. This being EPS. Both companies proving to grow revenue, but not turning profit or creating cash flow. From a balance sheet perspective, GME is actually quite a bit better here with 2:1 assets:liabilities and essentially no long term debt. The cash burn for GME is a result of their investment into new streams of revenue and will hopefully start to show improvement in regard to EPS with NFT marketplace opening. This same lack of cash flow generation held back TSLA for years, but they did eventually turn positive in 2020 and guess what happened to the share price? Yep, rocket emojis.

Tesla share price went from 130 in Jan, 2020 to 793 in Jan, 2021 (adjusted price for splits)

I think long term, if you believe in the NFT marketplace as a good move for the business of GME (as I do), we could see similar price action with institutional adoption and closed short positions over time. 

A couple of other things GME has working in their favor:

1. Insiders really believe. Insider buys 104k shares the last 2 days, sells 743 shares (form 4 filing)
2. Shrinking float. 76m shares - 13.6m(18% insiders) - 21.3m(28% institutions) - 10m (DRS) = **31.1m**

TLDR: GME is the next TSLA (in terms of stock performance). Once NFT marketplace starts to generate revenue and EPS turns positive we will see a TSLA-style run.

"Chart Voodoo on SPY**Tl;dr: Technical indicators coupled with upcoming events and the context of the current market as a whole, strongly indicate the market is either about to take a massive nosedive of the cliff, or have one last ramp to the moon before it burns on re-entry. Either way, massive moves incoming, beginning this or next week. A few charts help visualize this.**

OK, so here is a useful nugget of technical analysis on S&amp;P500 that should shed some light on what is about to happen next...

Unless you've been living under the icesheet of Europa, you should be well aware by now that this market... all of it, across the planet, although it's the US we're concerned with here... is heading for a ""Day After Tomorrow"", Tsunami-sized crash and depression that hasn't been seen since 1929. The only real question right now, is:

Is this it? Has this downturn marked the peak and were standing on the edge of the cliff, our center of gravity already leaning over? or is there still a last bump, a final ramp, to this madness, before it all collapses like a wet sandcastle?

Time will tell, but for speculation purposes, there are some neat technical indicators we might like to take a look at if we decide to speculate the moves to come.

I will use three S&amp;P500 E-Mini Futures charts to illustrate this.

Of note, is the simplicity of the charts to follow. The best chart work is simple and suggestive, not some convoluted overlap of schizoid drawings which could be mistaken for attempts to invoke some esotheric spirits.

To that end, the features of interest in these charts are as follows:

‚Ä¢ 2 √ó Fibonacci Extentions, different scales

‚Ä¢ Quad Witching Dates

‚Ä¢ Death Cross

‚Ä¢ Main Trendlines of this cycle

‚Ä¢ 3-Standard-Deviation Bollinger Bands (they just sit there)

Chart 1 - Trendlines: [IMAGE](https://i.ibb.co/0hsXYXV/20220314-225401.png)

You'll notice the 3 trendlines originate at the origin points of the main bull markets of the last decade. This  nested fractal-like feature is pretty common with bull runs, on any scale. As the length of the runs compresses, their amplitude increases.

You'll also notice a big Fibonacci going from the '07 peak, which is almost the same as the '00 peak, to the '09 trough. Bull runs love to peak around the x.618 or x.236 extensions, where 'x' is usually between 1 and 5, and this market seems to be no exception, after pinball-ing through all key levels.

NOTE: The 4 main trendlines neatly converge to a point. Also, the point coincides with the 5.236 retracement.

Chart 2: [IMAGE](https://i.ibb.co/0hsXYXV/20220314-225401.png)

The Fibonacci in ""Chart 1"" goes from the Feb2020 peak to the Mar2020 trough, and follows the ensuing run as it plays pinball against the key levels on to new highs. 

For those still unaware of the meaning of a Quad Witching, it is when a bunch of option expiration dates overlap, spawning all sorts of complexities and ramifications. They affect volatility and often price too.

NOTE: The current downturn has found support on the 1.618 extension level. The 2.618 level also coincides with the intersection of the main trendlines, just like the 5.236 in the other chart.

Chart 3: [IMAGE](https://i.ibb.co/G7fSVNN/20220314-221834.png)

This chart is a close-up of the first one. Upon this closer inspection, you can see the current All-Time-High neatly hitting the 4.618 level, which is one of the most popular peak levels for fractal bull runs like this one.

You can also see, the dreaded ""Death Cross"" forming. That is, the 50-Day Moving Average piercing the 200DMA to the downside. Now... here's the deal with these crosses. They can be fakeouts, from both sides. When a market is indecided such as this one, and the cross is young, it can flip back around and continue what it was doing before. This could be one of those times, or it could be a glaring signal that this bread is toast.

NOTE: Current peak at 4.618, a still-young Death-Cross, 5.236 Fib level matches trendline convergence.

And finally, the FOMC meeting is about to happen not far from Friday's Quad-Witching.

There are so many stars aligned here, it's a Conga Line of stars. Clearly, there is a massive amount of pent up energy in this market... with an upcoming Quad-Witching and an FOMC meeting, after 2 months of bouncing into a descending wedge, with the 50DMA having just touched the 200DMA... there are 2 main directions this can go:

DOWN - the 4.618 Fib was the peak, the market never retests that trendline and it all collapses at breakneck speed. Your DOOM Puts will finally pay if you cash them right and you've witnessed the beginning of the end.

UP - after FOMC/QuadWithcing, the market does one last quick and furious run towards the 5.236/2.618/Trendline-Convergence area, a.k.a ""The Moon"", with some bounces along the way at key levels, and while it might not hit it exactly, it would be a ramp to behold... before detaching it's boosters, hovering for a moment followed by a fiery re-entry and ballistic fall: see the ""DOWN"" paragraph above.

Whichever way it goes, a lot is pointing towards it going big. If you buy option strategies to take advantage of the big move, regardless of direction, you might make big bucks on the fall, or pretty good bucks on the rise. And if it goes up, then you can quite confidently put it all in DOOM strategies, since the only way from there is down, and that should pay even bigger bucks.

This post by no means covers the ""whole"" picture. It just presents a neat juxtaposition of technical signals and their translation.",1

- do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it‚Äôs my biggest holding. It‚Äôs the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world‚Äôs most valuable company before the end of the decade. 
- will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn. 
- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. 
- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don‚Äôt give financial advice. Read my post history to see what I‚Äôm buying and decide if you like any of the ideas.

"New Intel security flaw. AMD and ARM unaffected[source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12701) 

(Same researchers as Spectre/Meltdown) 

TL;DR, despite the hardware mitigation on Coffee Lake Intel processors remain vulnerable to out-of-order and speculative execution bugs that can allow untrusted code to gain system access. Unclear if Ice Lake is affected. 

In my opinion as an ECE I think there is a shot of Ryzen 3 beating Ice Lake once all the hardware/software mitigations imposed by the OS's and Intel to deal with all this. Intel has been an industry leader in single threaded performance largely due to their OoE secret sauce and deep instruction pipelines - now these vulnerabilities are negating their advantageous position. With lower clock speeds, larger die size, and fewer cores I would not be surprised if AMD beats Intel in real world benchmarks with same generation processors.

"GOOGLE free money glitch via a hidden symbolI was researching and performing technical analysis yesterday mroning and came across a hidden symbol for Google.

usually when people search for Google they type GOOG in ticker box. But did you know that Google has one more Symbol? GOOGL?

yes, with extra L! Don't believe me? Type it in your ticker box and find out. 

What will blow your mind is that both GOOG and GOOGL always moves in Sync. If one goes up, the other goes up as well. Always!

So what I plan to do is to Short GOOG and Long GOOGL at the same exact price. When they have reached peak I will sell GOOGL and when they are bottom I will buy GOOG.

"I believe AMD will take off to $40+ near/post earnings.Reasoning:

I follow /r/buildapcsales and am avid techie. Was part of the mining craze in 2016. I haven't seen GPU's and CPU's sell out this fast since mining craze in 2016.

This quarter, AMD released 2 huge market share eaters:

* 5700 and 5700 xt gpus

* Zen 2 series

5700 series gpus are eating market share from Nvidia, but not as aggressively as Zen 2 generation CPUs have been absolutely demolishing Intel. There is a competing CPU for pretty much every mid/high range CPU Intel has released. If you compare Intel and AMD there is almost a reversal in trends.

Both of these (CPU and GPU) are far superior for the price to performance ratio in the PC market. Scalpers have been buying up the CPU's and reselling on ebay at a higher price because that's how in demand these CPU's are. There has not been actual sales or deals on these CPU's other than things that are done through the platform selling the product (like Google first time purchase), and still these things sell out in minutes every time at full price.

Additionally, I took a look at the price history, and although i know fractals are usually bullshit, just for fun:

"[Discussion] Bull Thesis for NFLXI just got called a retard in my social circle for going long on NFLX &amp; honestly the best compliment I've had in a while. 

This is my first post on WSB and I'll make it short and sweet. 

Netflix bear argument: 

* ""Netflix is losing subscribers for the first time in 10 years""

True, but I also think that they've reached their peak here in the USA. Especially after the Covid stay at home boom. Everyone and their mother has a Netflix account. I've had mine for 10 years. It's like having cable in the 2000's. It's just expected. 

* ""Netflix is going to ruin it's service with their plan to implement ads""

Not true. I believe 99% of users currently signed up to Netflix won't even notice any change. Why? Because Netflix won't be replacing current users plans. They'll just add a second tier that sits below their current $14.99 plan. Everyone who is currently subscribed will have nothing to complain about. Probably won't even notice it's been implemented. I'm guessing it will be somewhere around $7.99-$9.99 and include said ads. It only gives the people more options and get's the company another revenue stream. Both great things IMO. 
 

FURTHERMORE. I believe (**Speculation alert**) Netflix will be expanding hard into foreign markets. I think they will, if they haven't already, invest in deepfake AI technology that will revolutionize how content is dubbed. [See this for an example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfvX2ToA1Ig) Imagine watching Breaking Bad or Stranger Things in Spanish/Italian/Whatever **Natively** where the actors lips are in sync with the dub over. This will bring all their great shows to a much wider audience.

Netflix hasn't been this low in 5 years. I don't think it can go down much deeper. Also I believe it's a great 1-5 year long hodl.

"I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....Elon Musk recently bought Twitter and became the single largest shareholder with obviously an intention to make some change. 

Twitter CEO ""excited"" for such a great person to join the company.  Offers director.  Was this just to limit Elon's power by only allowing maximum 14.9% stake?

Elon rejects.  Obviously for some good reason and likely does not want to be limited.

So what happens next?

Vanguard buys more Twitter and reports a higher stake than Elon in Twitter...

What is Vanguard's intention and why this timing?

Elon recently came out against ESG investing that is being pushed by Vanguard and Blackrock onto corporations they invest.

Vanguard is the largest shareholder of TSLA.  

Is this a war brewing?

I'm afraid that Vanguard will possibly sell lots of TSLA positions, reducing their holdings, for one purpose.  To make Elon worth less.

Now that that is outta the way... what if we did see a 20% correction? from the ATH that 20% dip would put us at 384. which would put us right back into the channel that SPY traded in for over 7 years from 2013 to 2020 when we saw the market absolutely tank and break that channel. followed by billions of dollars being pumped by the fed to cause us to shoot skyward and then start the current trend we are on...  weekly 100 day EMA is 394... 

white lines show the 7 year long channel. red/ blue show the current channel thats been almost 2 years long. what if we did tank? what if we did see a reset and this fell all the way back into the channel and then continued on in that channel? 

if you follow me you will know i believe we are going to see 455. but if that 455 breaks down that would break the 1.5 year long channel. would that be the sign?

RSI is showing a strong oversold reading, this downtrend will most likely not continue in the near term.

The Bollinger bands are showing we are entering a period of lower volume and lower volatility.  I don't think we will see any major run up or down, in the next weeks (Unless there is major news).

So, back to timing a recession, this chart has gotten me very interested.  You don't need a Bloomberg terminal to do this analysis though, I realized there are many problems with using this as an indication.

&amp;#x200B;

[30 Year Yields Compared to SPX](https://preview.redd.it/x7ljsn94mxt81.png?width=1474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53cbd12a0211926027298578d34e6cac326244d7)

Last week I said that the 30-year yields are better at predicting a market top.  Then I noticed, that both have margins of error, so finding the average of the 30Y + 10Y would be an even better indicator.  Also as the bond yields approach 0 they will decrease slower.  This is slightly an exponential trend, not a linear trend which can be fixed by graphing it logarithmically.

 

[Average of 10 Year and 30 Year Yields](https://preview.redd.it/xb0ov8ljyxt81.png?width=1477&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d926fc6f86b3307182dd4f7c63aa3e3eba866aa6)

As a continuation of the current uptrend in bond yields, I would expect the yields to cross this major level around the middle of June.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Average of 10 Year and 30 Year Yields](https://preview.redd.it/lsbab1e71yt81.png?width=1478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a6fbe97a05d8422c9d5c27ebfe8f80e6c858647)

This has predicted the top within about 5 months, exception of '94 though.

From this, I can conclude that when we have some recession in the next year, the central bank is just going to print more money and devalue our currency.  This is not a crisis though, no need to keep gold bars under your bed.  Maybe in another 30 years, it will be time to buy gold bars.  I just hope JPOW does not get too crazy and go to negative rates.

**Predictions**

I am not expecting any major moves in the market this week.  The stock market will most likely be fine until June.  I will look back at this in May though.  

Jerome Powell will talk Thursday at 1 pm, he may talk about reducing the balance sheet.  I don't think he will say anything crazy though, they are trying to keep the economy as stable as they can.  

Next Week I am just expecting a general uptrend in the overall market.  I will be looking for opportunities not just opening trades to have open positions.  It's very important to find asymmetric trades not FOMOing into OTM options. 

There is nothing crazy this week...

 \* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more

"Short term SPY calls, long term VIX buysWoke up today looking at SPY creeping up to ATH again. Cheers bulls, I salute you. Well done. As a contrarian pessimist, I can say that you guys get the cake.

But in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, ""How's the VIX? Been a while since I've seen that thing make the news."" And it's hovering around 13.50. Just broke 1 year low. The contrarian pessimist in me says, ""Surely this is it! The next bad tweet will send this skyrocketing!"" But I don't know when, and I don't feel like letting theta destroy my dignity while I wait. If there's one thing I have learned, it's that the stock market likes to grow slowly over time with short, dramatic selloffs occasionally decorating the charts for the sake of variety. So here's my plan.

VIX ATH in the last crash was above 50. ATL was Sep 2017 at about 9.50. We're at 13.50 right now. Bull or bear, I think we can all agree that this has been a LONG bull run. With the end of every bull market, one can expect high volatility. On top of that, Q4 is usually a volatile quarter because of end of year accounting. Companies need to get rid of any short term losses they may be holding for tax purposes. So here we are, late bull cycle, Q4, trade war, and VIX hovering around ATL. 

I can't say when, because the market can be irrational longer than I can be solvent. I don't feel like letting options destroy my capital waiting for the market to agree with me. But holding a leveraged volatility fund? At this point it just seems stupid not to do it.

In the short term, the market will display irrational exuberance before the bubble bursts. My trading money is still going with the trend to buy SPY calls as long as the market is blissfully happy. But of the $40 range between $10 and $50 in which the VIX has ALWAYS traded, we're in the bottom 10% of that very consistent tunnel. And with a leveraged fund like TVIX, that could turn into astronomical returns the next time Mr. Market forgets to take his meds.",0

WASHINGTON, July 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee voted Wednesday to approve a measure that would raise the age children are given special online privacy protections to 16 and bar targeted advertising to children by companies like TikTok and Snapchat without consent.

The bill, which was adopted by voice vote, will now go to the full Senate for consideration. There currently is no version of this bill in the House of Representatives.

The bipartisan bill, sponsored by Democratic Senator Edward Markey along with Senators Bill Cassidy, Richard Blumenthal and Cynthia Lummis, would raise from 12 to 16 the age of the children afforded special privacy protections online under an update of Markey's 1998 Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

Markey has previously singled out for criticism companies like Meta's Facebook, Google's YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat. 
Under the new bill, companies would not be allowed to collect personal information on anyone 16 years old or younger without consent and require companies to allow young users to erase personal information. It would also create an office within the Federal Trade Commission, which currently enforces COPPA, to address online privacy and marketing concerns related to minors.",1

From: Elon Musk

To: Everybody

Date: May 16, 2019

As mentioned at the company talk, it is extremely important that we examine every expenditure at Tesla no matter how small, and be sure that it is critical.

When making hundreds of thousands of cars, battery packs and solar systems, even a ten cent savings could be worth over $50,000 a year. There are over 10,000 unique parts and processes at Tesla, so making small improvements across the board has a giant cumulative impact.

At the same time, we must also continue to make our products subtly better in thousands of small ways.

It is important to bear in mind that we lost $700 million in the first quarter this year, which is over $200 million per month. Investors nonetheless were supportive of our efforts and agreed to give us $2.4 billion (our net proceeds) to show that we can be financially sustainable.

That is a lot of money, but actually only gives us approximately ten months at the first-quarter burn rate to achieve breakeven. It‚Äôs vital that we respect the faith investors have shown in Tesla, but it will require great effort to do so.

That is why, going forward, all expenses of any kind anywhere in the world, including parts, salary, travel expenses, rent, literally every payment that leaves our bank account must be reviewed, confirmed as critical and the top of every page of outgoing payments signed by our CFO.

I will personally review and sign every 10th page.

Please examine closely every expense where responsibility is, or probably should be, assigned to your group. If in doubt, assume it is on your plate, so that we don‚Äôt have anything slip through the cracks.

This will take at least a few weeks to get right. Please don‚Äôt worry if it isn‚Äôt correct at first.

This is hardcore, but it is the only way for Tesla to become financially sustainable and succeed in our goal of helping make the world environmentally sustainable.

Thanks again for your excellent work,

Elon",1

Nov 10 was SPY's [biggest daily gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_S%26P_500_Index) since the COVID face-ripper in March 2020. We were only about $2.50 away from being the largest ever. 

I loaded up on 11/11 puts at the end of the day, and wanted to spend my evening alone in the dark, scouring the internet for copium. This search led me to look at how SPY typically performs the day after a face ripper. 

For those who missed the link above, Wikipedia has the biggest daily percent and point gains laid out here:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_largest\_daily\_changes\_in\_the\_S%26P\_500\_Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_S%26P_500_Index)

I'm going to ignore anything pre-1940, since SP500 data is a bit weird back there. Below, though, are the size of the gaps between the closing price on a Shrek-dick green day, and the intraday low on the following trading day:

Oct 13/14 2008 - Closed at 101.35 on Oct 13, Intraday low of 97.11 Oct 14. **Drop of 4.2%.**  
Oct 28/29 2008 - Closed at 93.76 on Oct 28, Intraday low of 92.10 Oct 29. **Drop of 1.8%.**  
May 24/25 2020 - Closed at 243.15 on May 24, Intraday low of 239.75 on May 25. **Drop of 1.4%.**  
May 13/16 2020 - Closed at 269.32 on May 13, Intraday low of 237.36 on May 16. **Drop of 11.9%.**

The above values are from the list of the biggest PERCENT increases in SP500 history. The average daily gain percent gain for these dates is about 10%, so it's possible that they aren't valid data points to get an idea for what might happen tomorrow. Thankfully, if we look at the biggest POINT gains in history (where Nov 10, 2022 ranks in third place), we might get a better idea. Also, this list has a lot more recent data. To try to maximize the validity of our data points, I will only include values that are associated with a daily gain of over 3%:

Apr 6/7 2020 - Closed at 264.86 on Apr 6, Intraday low of 264.89 on Apr 7. **RISE of 0.01%.**  
Mar 26/27 2020 - Closed at 261.20 on Mar 26, Intraday low of 251.05 Mar 27. **Drop of 3.9%.**  
Mar 17/18 2020 - Closed at 252.8 on Mar 17, Intraday low of 228.02 on Mar 18. **Drop of 9.8%.**  
Mar 2/3 2020 - Closed at 309.09 on Mar 2, Intraday low of 297.57 on Mar 3. **Drop of 3.7%.**  
Mar 10/11 2020 - Closed at 288.42 on Mar 10, Intraday low of 270.88 Mar 11. **Drop of 6.1%.**  
Mar 4/5 2020 - Closed at 312.86 on Mar 4, Intraday low of 300.01 on Mar 5. **Drop of 4.1%.**   
Dec 26/27 2018 - Closed at 246.18 on Dec 26, Intraday low of 238.96 on Dec 27. **Drop of 3.9%.**  
Oct 13/14 2008 - Closed at 101.35 on Oct 13, Intraday low of 97.11 on Oct 14. **Drop of 4.2%.**

Using the above dataset, we can see that **since the 1930s, after days of profound gains, the mean drop to the intraday low the following day is 4.58%, and the median drop is 4%**. 

Assuming that tomorrow experiences an average drop of 4%, we may see a SPY price as low as $378.82 intraday. Even a ""very low"" 1.8% drop would put us at $387.50. 

We may see some blood tmrw, intraday at the very least.",0

"TSLA RALLY IS HEREThe small correction on Monday was to be expected since the MACD and RSI indicated overbought position for TSLA (BIG TIME). However the long term correction is still on the horizon, assuming the momentum, I would say late mid to late FEB. Those who buy FDs will be caught with their pants down.

Now, there is a big confusion to ""When will TSLA crash""... all I gotta say that it is not any time soon. We are going to see another decent correction after rally this week and the following week. Biggest indicator is that we are floating close to 70 RSI, which indicates that we are overbuying... obviously will reverse from there eventually (30-50 days from now)

TA aside and using the ""human catalyst"", since the Tesla FOMO is so huge right now, I would expect to rally to continue to the moon and mars and out of Solar system for the next 30 days with minor corrections along the way (usually Mondays) so don't hold FDs over weekends fellow autists.

"Weekly Risk Ranges for TSLA, AAPL, SPY, QQQ, IWM, GOOG, MSFT, AMD, AMZNIf this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.",0

"$TSLA Guide to Playing the TSLA Stock SplitAs all of you who have long traded TSLA know, TSLA stock price follows laws of numerology. In particular, it has strong affinity for price points like ""$69"", ""$1337"", ""420"" and let us not forget, ""$420.69"", which is the most powerful of these.

Because the board is going to do a 3:1 split, and because we know the shareholders will almost certainly support it, we can trade options in anticipation. 

Quite simply, a future share at $420.69 is thus $1262.07 in current value. The split sounds like it should be done by fall. So, the play is therefore to simply buy up November or October calls at $1262, or you could buy a bit lower to make sure it's ITM, call it $1200.

I made jokes about this last time, and everyone thought I was being a moron, but had I actually done the trade I would've made 100x because the stock did in fact rally tremendously LAST time this happened, and crossed 420. Because past results are often a prediction of future performance\*, we can expect TSLA stock to end up north of $420.69, since that is the nature of things.

Good luck losing money on this truly moronic idea based in no valid reasoning.

"4-8-22 SPY, QQQ, Apple Weekly TA  

Today brought us something a little new for SPY today‚Ä¶ we saw a reversal of the reversal intraday today. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fci736kvnes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=792da5f02c57fd36ced5b9555201f2bf672f55a3

After going fairly green in pre-market only to slip to red before open and then fall pretty aggressively down to 445.94 and what seemed to be a bearish day was turned around on the bears. At 1045am we saw a massive green candle that took SPY all the way back to 450.63 at its high. I really still do not quite have a reason for this candle as there was no new at the time besides paypal/ tesla starting to mine which surely the markets wouldn‚Äôt have reacted to. However, the only thing is the VIX at the time saw a massive dive down from its highest peak at 22.34 straight down to 20.28 within two hours. Another massive 10% intraday move. VIX however, found support at 20.28 and ended up creeping it way back un to 21.57 before close which allowed SPY to fall all the way back down to 446.68 during the last 15 minutes and close at 447.57 for a -0.27% day. 

The one thing I take away from this intraday movement today was that we clearly opened red and intended to be red based on the open price action and the end of day price action. Watching the red candles move (before the rip) vs. watching the green candles move (after the rip) showed quite the story. After the massive green candle up SPY sat n range of 450.63 to 448.5 for over 3.25 hours. However, most of that time was spend between 449.1 and 449.8 (1.5 hours of it). 

While SPY was able to touch 450.63 at its peak it was very clear that 1. 449.9 was massive resistance and very very heard for SPY to stay over for very long and 2. That 449.1 was very heavy support for SPY also. Going into the end of the day it almost looked like SPY would trade within that $0.50 range till close but eventually the bears stepped in, the vix rebounded up and we got a massive 10mil 15min candle reaching a low of 446.68 before settling at 447.57 for the day.

15min chart wise I am watching two channels. I labeled one as purple and one as red. The purple channel is the potential bull rally rest before more bull rally channel. Going into Monday that will give a total range of 453 to 446 to remain in the bullish channel. 

The red bear channel which if you see has some black intra channel lines which really form a nice triple bear channel. We are currently trading in the upper part of that top tier of the triple channel and rejected resistance of it today when we hit 450.63. To remain in the bear channel top tier resistance gives a max of 448 and gives first support at 443 followed by 438 if we break into the middle tier of the channel. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v6y56qixnes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33e64d65b64953786461671b1908b02a325d0816

Looking at the daily channel SPY impressively managed to remain in both the overall bullish red channel and the bearish grey channel today. However, looking at the daily candles we saw a massive gap down that finished in a doji, followed by a green candle to fill the gap, followed by another red doji. I also am seeing the 2nd day in a row that the daily 8ema acted as hard resistance and that SPY failed to close above it. That is a pretty bearish finish in my opinion. In addition, we also saw a dip once again below the daily 20 ema at 447.25 and the 100ema at 446.76. We looked like we were just about to close under the daily 20ema which would have all but ensured a red Monday. 

However, this is now the third candle that has broken the 20/ 50 ema and that has closed completely under the daily 8ema. It appears it is only a mater of time before we see a close below the 20, 50 and 100 ema below 445.43 and test support at the daily 200ema of 439.98. I believe that day is going to be Monday. 

We also are still seeing a daily MACD sell signal along with a slightly downward RSI at 52. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fetk2i2ynes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a419da17b2e005aadd75813539c147308c53b897

Weekly chart wise it is a bit different than the daily chart. This one has three channels to watch as we find the true move to come. The key take away from this is the doji candle last week above the weekly 20 and 8ema proceeded by the red candle that broke the 8 and 20 ema. Mind you the candle today unfortunately did not close below the weekly 20ema at 446.53, which would have sealed a more confident red week. The candle breaking back below the 8/20 ema is a bearish omen. The weekly 8ema also failed to get above the 20ema this week due to the downside. Weekly chart wise we will look for the candle to break down below the 20ema at 446.53 and the 8ema at 445.11 with a goal of the 50ema at 435.11 as the next support test. 

For me I will 100% be looking for a red open Monday and look for a retrace to 440 Monday. 445 should be pretty strong support as we have seen but after the massive rejection at 450 again today I believe the downside is being built and shape into the market. I also think markets are going to price in CPI data Monday in order to be able to run it up Tuesday if news is better than expected. There is a chance we could see 450-452 Monday and then CPI Tuesday will tank the market down to 440-445 but I give that about a 20% chance vs. the 80% chance I see 440-445 Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apple daily bull channel was once again broke today. This time in my opinion a nail in that bull run coffin. We are now looking at a new bear channel (yellow) for next week. With the 10 year yield running so much high today at 2.706 TECH looked extremely weak and will definitely struggle to get some bullish momentum until we see those trickle down. 

One thing that we saw today with APPLE is that it failed after two full candles rejected the daily 8ema completely that today I failed to even break its daily 8ema and it closed under its daily 20 ema. I mentioned yesterday and on Wednesday in my TA that a close under the daily 20ema for Apple is exactly what the bears needed in order to see a potential downside of 165 to 168 this week coming up (daily 50 and daily 100ema). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/og8sx17znes81.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=354ae4bf20fb8d43dc656cd1a08d8ab49137e2f2

On Apples weekly candle the one thing that I am watching for is that we technically are still in a weekly bull channel. The one thing though is that unless Apple can get an unbelievably impossible gap up to 176 it will break the grey bull channel and be within its red bear channel. 

The weekly 8ema at 168.85 was not breached this week but we can with $0.50 of it. I suspect a proper test of that Monday and I suspect we could break below the weekly 8ema and even the weekly 20ema at 165.52. 

As I mentioned in the daily section of apple I fully anticipate a drop and test of the 20 ema weekly support at 165.5 this week and that in and of itself will drag spy down too. 

&amp;#x200B;

QQQ had a very bearish week this week seeing this nice red bear channel forming. With a current MACD sell signal along with a falling RSI at 47 there is plenty of downside with tech. The 10 year treasury rising to the highest levels in decades is going to make it very hard for tech bulls to get any run this week. Monday range for the red bull channel puts us at 348.7 to 330 (unlimited downside). QQQ would need to see a red pre market that holds and does not allow for break of green otherwise we will be looking for a new channel come Monday to draw. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fp2zdwu0oes81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5f1adf517d000d2e51827a9cd27106f64c79e5

QQQ weekly chart looks the most bearish of the three. I am seeing a reversal candle last week with a long top wick followed by a very red candle this week that failed to break last weeks highs. This candle broke through the weekly 20, 50 and 8 ema supports. With a close like this for the QQQ weekly candle I highly suspect that we could see a test as low as 320 to 330 next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vq57nki1oes81.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc4b964fec7d65af2c8fee89ed0a3c1672584c81

The VIX saw a wild swing of a week with beginning of the week lows ranging at 18.5 to the highest of 24.78 on Wednesday. The VIX closed the wek at 21.17 which is pretty much dead nuts middle of the high and low range. That 18.5 low of the VIX is some of the lowest we have seen SPY trade since January 13th. Being that the VIX attempted two times this week and two times last week to unravel below 18.5 but couldn‚Äôt says a lot about the markets fear. With the VIX closing this low at 21.17 there is plenty of room for the vix to rebound upward and cause a sell off this week coming up. 

Heading into next week we have only a four day week with Friday being good Friday. That means we will NOT have Friday expiations of options, however, we do have OPEX on Thursday for the Monthly options expiring. 

With CPI data coming Tuesday morning. Despite everyone knowing its going to be terrible and I don‚Äôt really see how it can not be worse than expected due to inflation, the war, gas prices, covid, etc. My expectation is to see the market price in a terrible CPI Monday and Tuesday the markets will be free to rally if it is as expected or they will tank if it is terrible and then recover. The one thing we need to watch for next week is if CPI is truly terrible whether the feds (JPOW) will do any sort of emergency rate hike, unwinding of QT, balance sheet adjustments, etc. 

My anticipation would be SPY see a red day Monday probably nothing impressive -1% to -1.5% to get us to that key 440-445 level. Overall the one thing I continue to learn every week is that the VIX is the gateway to spy. If you are not watching the VIX and learning its levels you are handicapping yourself. 

10% challenge weekly update-

Overall I was able to have a pretty great week this week thankfully. 

I made 25 trade. 17 of which were green for a total 68% win rate on the week and averaged +6%/ trade.

Interestingly enough I was 0 for 4 on apple trades which is not normal for me. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500/ week and I was able to return a total of $7004 this week. 

Some lessons this week is that I need to manage my risk, I let quite a few losers run for way to long and that hurt not only my account but my % gains for the week. 

The one thing that I want to do this next week is continue to limit my capital/ trade allocation. I saw myself this week start to increase my capital and in doing so I did not decrease the risk with further out expirations. This week I will work on risky trades (0-2dte) using smaller capital and when I feel confident in a trade utilizing 3-5 dte for the increased capital. I also need to make sure I remember to stay humble after a big week so that I do not take a chance of ruining those gains and seeing a revert to mean of my account. 

Overall great week for me and the server despite some fuckery in the markets which I do not forsee stopping at any time soon unfortunately.",0
"TSLA ER FAIL SBUX ER WIN tldr; blew some of my education fund on Tesla ER, made it back plus more on Starbucks ERSo recently I had some funds for the remainder of my degree wired into my checking account. I let my pops know I was going to manage some of it myself, essentially swing trade it or let it sit in something passive for weeks at a time. In true WSB style, I was mostly in $TVIX and $UGAZ then slingin' some FD's here and there. I took a decent sized hit on $V ER, opened the day down a considerable amount. I went to work with the two remaining day trades I had and got in some pre earnings $TSLA FDs finishing the day roughly even, I was happy with it. Then $TSLA ER happened, quick pop up to 268, no buyers and down she went, nearly 12%. Opened the next day down even lower, I wasn't gonna fold, but I was a little more tense at this point. I went big on $TSLA calls shortly after, doubled my losses on $TSLA and took a decent chunk out of my newly acquired funds. Spent most of the rest of the day kind of sulking and feeling sorry for myself until I was sitting at my desk..10 minutes to closing bell. I noticed $SBUX ER was at the end of the day, a name I was very familiar with, had been following it for weeks, played Q3 ER of 2018 and made a considerable amount then as well. I took the remainder of what I had in my account after being down more than a couple grand and all-inned $SBUX. I sat there for minutes after the bell, it actually even moved down about 1.5% before jumping more than $6, a huge beat. I made seven grand the next morning selling shortly after the opening bell. 

I felt compelled to share my degeneracy with you folks here because if this story inspired even one of you, it'd be worth the fifteen minutes I spent typing it. I'll try to attach proof and everything here, thanks for being a part of my first real post on reddit. Happy FD'ing. 

tldr; lost a chunk of my educational funds on $TSLA ER, came back in a big way on $SBUX ER. 

p.s. would love a flair

[*Obligatory do your own research and draw your own conclusions statement.*]

**POSITIVES**

- Both Sony and Microsoft are using custom AMD APUs in their latest consoles. (APU = CPU + GPU combined into one.) In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 weeks, both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X have been selling like hotcakes, with fresh inventory being depleted within minutes. 

- AMD has been the underdog vs Intel in the consumer desktop CPU space for as long as I can remember. But for the first time in 15 years, [AMD is winning in terms of market share](https://www.techradar.com/news/amd-overtakes-intel-in-desktop-cpu-market-share-for-the-first-time-in-15-years). Intel has been able to stay competitive with their latest generation of CPUs by offering significant discounts. Despite this, AMD's CPUs still remain in higher demand and sell out almost instantly (at MSRP). 

- AMD owns Radeon, which is their brand of Graphics Cards. These compete directly with Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Performance wise, they're up there with NVDA, but still lagging a bit in the ray tracing department which most will agree is the future. Key word being future, it's not a big deal *yet*. And thanks to the pandemic these too also sell out super quick. 

- AMD's next generation of mobile CPUs will be launching soon. Just like their desktop lineup, you can expect these to outperform their Intel counterparts as well. AMD's previous mobile generation of 4000 series chips crushed Intel - the biggest problem was availability. People wanted the AMD chips but for whatever reason, they were found mostly in the mid-range and lower end gaming laptops. I expect the availability issue to improve greatly this year. As we can see, certain manufacturer's like Asus are already featuring the AMD SKUs in their [top of the line gaming laptops](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Strix-Scar-17-ditches-Comet-Lake-H-for-an-unlocked-Ryzen-9-5900HX-with-liquid-metal-and-RTX-3080-Mobile.514702.0.html). 

**RISK FACTORS**

- While speaking purely from a monetary standpoint, overall I think the pandemic has been a net positive for tech companies like AMD. However, AMD's own fearless leader Lisa Su recently said: [""...the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.""](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc)

- Unable to keep up with demand: [AMD and NVIDIA confirm that GPU stock levels will remain non-existent for the foreseeable future](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-and-NVIDIA-confirm-that-GPU-stock-levels-will-remain-non-existent-for-the-foreseeable-future.514957.0.html).
[Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-has-asked-amd-for-help-in-combating-xbox-series-x-stock-shortages)

- Apple has already started producing their own in house ARM processors for both their laptops and desktops. This doesn't really affect AMD (yet) because [Apple has been using Intel chips in their laptops and desktops for the past 15 years.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html#:~:text=Menu-,Apple%20is%20breaking%20a%2015%2Dyear%20partnership%20with,on%20its%20Macs%20%E2%80%94%20here's%20why&amp;text=Apple's%20new%20laptops%20and%20desktop,can%20improve%20laptop%20battery%20life.) And despite being a massive company, Apple only makes up about [13% of the PC market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-shareapple/#:~:text=In%20the%20fourth%20quarter%20of,the%20fourth%20quarter%20of%202020.). AMD is still Apple's partner for discrete graphics, but that could change soon. This is definitely something you'll want to keep your eye on though because other titans like [Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/article/microsoft-processors-int/microsoft-working-on-in-house-chips-for-its-servers-pcs-idUSKBN28S2Y1), [Google](https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2020/04/google-is-making-its-own-chips.html), and Amazon are all either working on, or producing their own in house chips. In my opinion, this is not nearly as bad as it sounds. Let's break it down by company.

 - [Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company‚Äôs Surface lineup run on Intel chips, too.](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20worked%20with%20AMD,move%20away%20from%20just%20Intel.&amp;text=Microsoft%20co%2Dengineered%20an%20ARM,a%20couple%20of%20months%20ago.) Only some of Microsoft's laptops run on AMD hardware. 

 - [Google is readying its own in-house processors for use in future Pixel devices, including both phones and eventually Chromebooks, too.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/google-said-to-be-preparing-its-own-chips-for-use-in-pixel-phones-and-chromebooks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADHPvna5MKFbSAnwNIPsW4kMhD7zhe-7IJtk0AzQP1Rrer78Olm_S_019orsNcQA9Ezk_sCz0z8My1nHGdTap_0-SYZtHKs1U9v9ni-AGkuJzp3cOHYUDSEu7b90qMQIDsc-PC8tFFceJElhUcPhJ3ctKtatuQcLkrIF1VotSBz1#:~:text=The%20Axios%20report%20says%20that,machine%20learning%20and%20Google%20Assistant.) Again, because Google currently relies more on Intel CPUs this is not a big blow to AMD's bottom line. A quick check of BestBuy's inventory shows [47](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Celeron%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i5%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20i7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m3%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Core%20m7%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~Intel%20Pentium&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories) Chromebooks with Intel SKUs and only [7 with AMD parts](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;iht=y&amp;keys=keys&amp;ks=960&amp;list=n&amp;qp=parent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A4%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20A6%5Eparent_processormodelsv_facet%3DProcessor%20Model~AMD%20Ryzen%203&amp;sc=Global&amp;st=chromebook&amp;type=page&amp;usc=All%20Categories).
 - The chips that Amazon is producing are for their [cloud computing business](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/amazon-apple-chips-intel-arm.html). These were also replaced by Intel.

AMD has earnings coming up on the 26th which I think they're going to shatter. I probably would not recommend trying to play off of that though as ERs can be quite unpredictable, especially if the news is positive. Personally, I think AMD is going to üöÄüöÄ after ER, but I'm not betting on that. Which is why my current position (30% of my portfolio) is LEAPS: (x2) Jan 2022 90c.

My conservative 6 month PT for AMD is 110. Also open to hearing any other potential risks I may have overlooked. To be on the safe side I'm only including 6 rockets.

"10/5/2022 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisThe question everyone is wondering is‚Ä¶ is the bottom in OR is this still just a convincing dead cat bounce? In my opinion the jury is still out. I am leaning with essentially an inside day on SPY but tech looking pretty strong (apple specifically) and after a very deep red open and massive recovery even going green at open point that we are going to finish this week out green and next week see a retrace in preparation for CPI. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s6plwqaur1s91.png?width=931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28fcc4b885eae5ad97eb97897c617c70e1e94e3a

Spy had broken the previous V bottom support but now we have this v bottom support. We are looking at a pretty fat bodied doji. This should with the two day push, daily 8ema support retest and holding, 370 range support test hold and briefly breaking over 378 before closing just under it provide upside for tomorrow. This to me was a bullish day. We looked extremely doomish this morning and then the bulls stepped in and let this rally almost all day. EOD drop was most likely profit takers. 

Key resistance bulls need to conquer tomorrow is the 378 and the daily 20ema. The next major resistance that we will likely push for is 382.1 which puts us through the black bear channel and puts us in line to Friday or next week test the blue bear channel that dates back to August. As long as bulls continue to defend that 370.6 level like they did today I am biased to the upside. 

Key support- 373.5 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 366.7

Key resistance- 378 -&gt; 379.8 (black bear channel) -&gt; 382.1 -&gt; 386.4

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mkst7jsur1s91.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a48f24d1280b7c321d2679275164d4e74c4abcc2

If we look at SPY weekly you can see that there is a pretty big case that we are going to test 3985.2 resistance we also have a very convincing V bottom forming along with retaking the weekly 200ema. If the bulls can take back that weekly 8ema and close over 385.2 this week then that should provide a lot of upside for next week especially with a bullish CPI. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b6t6g09vr1s91.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f9d967aa205975bf1f62684313e483480dc6cd5

Futures put in quite the range from 3734 to 3820 today. Futures is currently sitting right at that key 3805 resistance. With a dragonfly doji we should expect upside here. Key v bottom support will be at 3805. With a back test of 3735 previous resistance that should provide a big support base going forward. 

Support- 3805-&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3735

Resistance- 3880 -&gt; 3925

Apple looked stronger then the rest of the market all day today. Even this morning when SPY and Tesla were selling off apple was very delayed in its sell off. The other actually impressive thing is that Apple daily candle closed as a bullish engulfing candle at 0.21% when yesterday was a 2.56% green day. Apple also perfectly back filled its gap which should allow for further upside movement. If bulls can retake that key 149.3 resistance that was heavy support previously that would be very bullish going forward. 

Key support- 146 -&gt; 144.2 -&gt; 141.4

Key resistance- 147.7 (blue bear channel) -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 150.8

&amp;#x200B;

My tesla pattern that I called out 2 weeks ago when it hit 312 has finally played out completely as far as I am concerned. The low average prior to the move up was 222 and the high average was 242 with 234 being the privot point. With a test and pretty impressive bounce off 233.27 today I actually am expecting quite a bit of upside for tesla eow and even next week. 

Tesla is down 18% in 5 days, 20% in 6 days and 26% in 11 days... In my opinion it is due for a bounce. I believe yesterday before the Twitter news dropped tesla actually was going for a relief bounce closer to 260. I do believe eventually this downside play needed to happen but now its happened we should be looking for upside. As long as Apple and Spy as pushing tesla should push with it. With the closing of a pretty large dragonfly doji after a massive sell off I am looking for that bounce this week on Tesla. 

Another key thing is that the 5 day long (6 tomorrow) resistance line is in play and unless tesla opens under 239.4 (-0.6%) and holds red all day then we will break that resistance and we should see further upside. There is a small amount of room for the huge falling wedge to play out one more day to the downside and test 226 support but I favor with SPY and Apple looking strong that we do bounce. However, if Apple and SPY come out weak tomorrow like today we should see the 220s hit. 

If the upside doesn‚Äôt play out intraweek I suspect it plays out next week. 

Support- 234.6 -&gt; 226.4 -&gt; 222

Resistance- 239.4 -&gt; 242.3 -&gt; 249.2 -&gt; 254.7 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/23rfmyswr1s91.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b30bdbc38eb95d4873fb5f1432e65040deed048a

The VIX continues to be overall undecided on what it wants to do holding over that key 28.4 pivot level. However we saw a back test of the daily 8ema resistance which did hold and show sell off into EOD. I suspect the VIX to break under that 28.4 level tomorrow which should provide upside potential for SPY. 

10% challenge-

Another pretty killer day for me today. Most of it came from Swings though. I struggled this morning with the techicals which looking back makes sense because I was attempting to find scalps prior to the v bottom rally. Technicals this morning and early afternoon once again were out of wack but by EOD were playing nicely again.

"SPY and 295Yo peeps 

I‚Äôm here to throw out something that most of the big boys and heavy hitters already know. 295 is the key ceiling / bottom for SPY tendies. 

If we don‚Äôt break 295 today (maybbbbeeeee tomorrow) we will head back down to 282. 

If you‚Äôre holding puts please for the love of god close them once 296 breaks. The bear game is on pause now. 

If you‚Äôre holding puts and SPY kisses 295 and maybe tops out at 295.5 with lots of volume then you know you‚Äôve made the right play. Now hold those fuckers like a real man.

"META $FBMETA hovering around $200 and even below is a fantastic buy whether you plan to hold short or long term. Besides the stock market dropping, why are people bearish on Meta? Let‚Äôs take a look at what the bears üåà üêª are saying to better understand risk-to-reward on our META plays.

Reasons for üêª META sentiment: high 
 1) metaverse is autistic af &amp; Money pit
 2) competition; TikTok, etc
 3) missing on earnings Q4
 4) losing users
 5) Company wide layoffs
 6) Lawsuits 
 7) Apple headwinds 

Lets address the META üêª case.

I do agree the pivot to the ‚Äúnext frontier‚Äù of the immersive metaverse was dumb af üòÇ for a platform barely anyone trusts to even put personal information on. No way I will use it for work, etc , like ever. FB also never created the idea of metaverse, they simply just tried to take credit for it all. Also the amount of investment will be a money pit especially with little ways to monetize. Theres also competition for metaverse and social media platform competition like tiktok. However im neutral on tiktok because it could fade away in a year or 2. But losing users for META was due to competition, however the user numbers are returning with global market reach and can continue up, we will Have to keep track to ensure META isn‚Äôt continuously losing users Quarter by quarter. 

Missing on earnings Q4: we did see META beat earnings Q1FY22 so back to business for them! Layoffs also help cut expenses. Net income did fall, which im thinking metaverse bs R&amp;D skewing operational expenses. Meta‚Äôs advertising revenue in Q1 2022 still grew by 6% YoY to $27bn despite Apple headwinds. 

IOS privacy issue per COO is focused on:
1) Growing video monetisation, especially short-form video-like reels 2) Evolving Meta‚Äôs ad systems to do more with less data 3) Investing in AI and machine learning to support our ads infrastructure

OVERALL: bullish

Reasons:
1) META will overcome privacy issues dealing with IOS
2) User growth will show strength in next earnings as fad social media platforms dissipate
3) earnings will be beat next quarters
4) someone internal will tell Mark Z to stick to stealing people‚Äôs ideas instead of trying to come up with his own and hopefully pull plug on excessive spending on Metaverse 
5) P/E of 15 = undervalued 
6) Michael Burry bought shares at $222, and he is the ultimate üêª 
7) META is not disappearing anytime soon
8) find new ways to monetize all their holdings like Whatsapp
9) FAANG apes ü¶ç strong

"AMD - constantly outperforming, constantly undervalued?
**Basics**

As long as you haven't been living under a fucking rock for the last decade, you know that AMD is a major player in electronic devices. While it has a minority hold in its markets, it still has a considerable market share AND has a hand in both GPUs and CPUs. It's versatile.

While the silicon shortage is still big and doesn't show any signs of slowing, AMD is still most likely making a shitload of profit from the continuous buyouts of graphics cards for mining and the continuous selling of CPUs.

**EPS/Financial history**

AMD has been continuously crushing quarterly earnings targets for at least the past year, and shows no signs of slowing. It has consistently maintained a steady and rising profit.

[Constantly winning](https://preview.redd.it/qz0qs58rh9571.png?width=332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d615f35e833c3563f23d4de50afe3956f490d61b)

On top of this, the company has a total cash balance of 3.12 billion and a total debt of only 551 million, which is fucking great.

[It's doing great with managing its debt and total cash to say the least](https://preview.redd.it/vh2sh5xai9571.png?width=422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61451edd2ef36120f80b83aefbfbce123fe2813e)

Not made up your mind yet? If not, I have even more great news for you! The company has been constantly underestimated/undervalued despite all these great numbers. The past 6 months have been shit which isn't to say it's been terrible in the long run which it definitely has not, but for a company that holds so much market in two major component categories at both the business and consumer level it's ridiculous for the stock to be consistently falling.

[Constantly going down](https://preview.redd.it/j2pavto0j9571.png?width=434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26816d6c905488484879bc98f527d8ac15accef9)

**Shorts and shares**

The company is decently shorted with around 7% of the shares being shorted for a company with a solid background, which could be a disaster waiting to happen. Again, it's not heavily shorted by any means but I don't think 7% is something to scoff at.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zk34ou1sl9571.png?width=427&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6215e701d1970588345fb0c063ae217516419a0c

&amp;#x200B;

**Memeablility**

Now that we've gone over all the boring numbers, let's talk about the memability of the company. It's a fucking computer parts company. Computers=gaming, gaming=memes. It's simple logic.

&amp;#x200B;

**More general points**

AMD has a solid community reputation, and while the performance its components put out is not on par with that of nvidia and intel, the products are generally more user/consumer friendly and cheaper, plus not everyone is looking to buy an RTX 6090 with liquid shit cooling built in for the unaffordable price of a kidney. AMD is geared more towards the average consumer which makes up a large portion of the computer market. Not only this but AMD chips are appearing more and more in laptops and pre-built computers. Another small point is that Microsoft is using AMD chips in their new generation of Xbox.

"Bezos, Cow Farts, and You: How $AMZN's deal w/ $CLNE is the most confusing in at least 30 seconds; unwinding it so people will stop being so ignorant about it.Hello, ""Apes"".  it is I...also....ape.  Yes, ape.  Here to bless you with lots of rocket emojis and bananas as I am clearly one of you.  Or something.  We still say on fleek, right? I mean, I totally know, but I'm not sure if you, too, are...you know, fellow ape....

&amp;#x200B;

Hmm, it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard.  This makes fellow ape very angry, and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this, ape honor.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I've seen an enormous amount of confusion from the, you know, ""non-apes"", about what $CLNE's contract with $AMZN is.  So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don't get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information.  So let's talk about it:

&amp;#x200B;

# What's the deal:

&amp;#x200B;

In late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide.  This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN's warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

The first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today's value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don't know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they'll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.

&amp;#x200B;

# Now, the part the less intelligent ""non-apes"" don't seem to grasp, but the most important part:

&amp;#x200B;

Less discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they've got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it's the part most people don't seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they're paying, which means it's in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as ""gently nudging"" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean ""waterboarding until they comply"".  You're already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why does any of this matter?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, ""fellow ape"", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it's this:  If $AMZN's ""win"" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to ""win"", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE's price should not be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN is paying, that's wrong, and everybody who's been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN's cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn't agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.

&amp;#x200B;

So there the ""non apes"" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn't get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO'd into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn't understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can't.  Jeff's not as wise an ape as a WSB ape.

&amp;#x200B;

Components would be removed from the Index as a result of periodic corporate actions as well as the results of the quarterly rebalances. All removals will be announced at least three trading days before the effective date of the removal. It should be noted that in the case of mergers and acquisitions, every effort will be made to remove the company at some reasonable time ahead of the suspension in trading in the acquired company. There will be certain situations and corporate actions that would require the removal of a company that has already ceased trading. In those cases, the company will be removed from the Index at its last traded price, or, at the discretion of the Index Administrator, at a derived price that most accurately represents its postsuspension value.

I told her I was divorce my wife and our 4 kids because they where liabilities. Sold my pets too. 
She looked stifft into my eyes and after some seconds she told me that she could
lend me some dough. I was hesitant to use her money because she worked hard for those money. She married young to some rich old dude. So what will i do with gramnas dough? I will immediately wire to my broker. And Buy AMD ASAP monday.

"$AMDA can we talk? DD inside.Can we talk about $AMDA? Due to metal wear in medical implants causing metal poisoning, plastic parts causing bone loss and silicon nitride being biofriendly material, killing bacteria and promoting bone fusion I think it may be only a matter of time before silicon nitride catches momentum in spine joint and dental implants. Especially factoring the netflix documentary ""bleeding edge"" exposing the metal poisoning issue. Revision surgery for these complications are estimated at $10 billion a year in a $140 billion dollar medical implant market. The danger here is the reverse split and it's important to call the bottom before entry. My theory on bottom is based on a 15 million public offering recently closed. Don't really want to go into why I believe this indicates bottom as it's speculation. So i\`m only putting in enough I\`m completely safe with losing expecting to lose everything to revers splits and maintain strong hands. With the recent offering this should have a 35M  share  float so an estimated value of 17.5 million at .50 cents a share for the entire company(my maximum target buy price). The supposed brass ring of a $140 billion dollar industry. I can agree with this math, from what i've heard speculated, that this could translate into  a large profit, possibly on Buy out and share conversion. Obviously, looking at the ticker, This would require very strong hands to not get shook and I suggest minimizing risk here to a very small long bet. Seems like alot of Money invested into a solid material in initial public offering can be picked up off the trading room floor here for pennies on the dollar. Just hard to believe looking at the ticker and having to spend the time Deep diving the Research studies to ever consider a long hold here for the normies on wall street.

"AMD News is priced in...I literally know nothing about AMD and am pretty tech illiterate so take my advice with a grain of salt. I‚Äôm seeing two camps around AMD: those who know technology who think AMD is going to be super hot and give intel a run for their money and those who think it‚Äôs ‚ÄúpRiCeD iN‚Äù already.

This reminds me a lot of Dominos Pizza to be honest... Back at the tail end of the financial crisis, some friends of mine saw that Dominos (DPZ) had finally come to their senses and changed how they did business- they turned their production process and recipes on their head in order to actually make a product that people wanted to buy and weren‚Äôt just ‚Äúsatisfied that they bought a cheaper alternative to better pizza‚Äù. Except for the pizza part, does this Sound familiar? 

So anyway, DPZ had gone from $4 to $11 as they went from near bankrupt to actually competitive with a good product. We bought in at about $11 once the product was getting good feedback. We SOLD it at $13-14 after scalping a 20% gain. We figured the good news and the improved product was pRiCeD iN already, we had made our money, and the stock had essentially tripled in a year. 

Whoa were we wrong. Every time the stock doubled or tripled we said it was priced in already and there was no point in buying it back because the trend was likely over soon because pizza is competitive and there is no moat and well funded competitions...

Anyway- this situation just reminded me of what I‚Äôm seeing arguing about AMD. If they really are making a better product than the competition (I‚Äôm too stupid to understand if that‚Äôs true or not), ride the freaking wave.",0

"AMD heading to MARS!!!... ETA SOON!!! - Next Stop: Galaxy limits!# Dear Crew, this is your Captain speaking.

On your left, you can see the moon, which we are about to pass.

Our destination is still MARS (thanks to Tesla &amp; Elon adopting AMD's APU's and GPU's).

We expect an EARLY ETA thanks for the J-Powell tailwinds. Dr. Lisa Su is still thumbs up!

Recent events provide a **HIGH degree of certainty** that AMD‚Äôs **MISSION will be successful**.

Namely:

**1- AMD Genoa (Zen 4) to have 128 cores (256 threads) winning the DATACENTER (INTEL admits)**

AMD was already taking market share from Intel in the datacenter, but the latest leak (from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV / **HE's BACK!!!**) has Intel‚Äôs own internal presentations **admitting AMD will EXTEND the LEAD** in the Datacenter (screenshot below).

[Leak from the reputable Jim of AdoredTV - The Scottish king is BACK!!!](https://preview.redd.it/aajw3pq5bw571.jpg?width=1299&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3bcd4f06a39c9bdae4c233fe7fb2e2c1ee81d1a)

Watch his latest video analysis here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNs432VgxmQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNs432VgxmQ)

His confirmation tweet here: [https://twitter.com/AdoredTV/status/1405161144843739148](https://twitter.com/AdoredTV/status/1405161144843739148)

In  essence, one should expect that if core count is going up for Zen 4  (from 64 to 128), at the VERY least, consumer chips will go from 16 to  24. Furthermore, Threadripper **Zen 4 will be a BEAST**.

&amp;#x200B;

**2- AMD 6900XTX LC (liquid cooled) spotted.**

AMD already achieved the #1 World RECORD in FireStrike last month, breaking 3300MHz in a 6900XT.

[https://www.techpowerup.com/282216/radeon-rx-6900-xt-overclocked-to-3321mhz-breaks-firestrike-world-record](https://www.techpowerup.com/282216/radeon-rx-6900-xt-overclocked-to-3321mhz-breaks-firestrike-world-record)

However,  that is NOT their BEST chip. Thanks to better bins, there‚Äôs the 6900  XTX which is liquid cooled, with faster memory, higher clock speeds and higher TDP. **A MONSTER!!!**

[Latest super bin model spotted 6900XTX... a RECORD BREAKER for sure!!!](https://preview.redd.it/74prhnfabw571.jpg?width=1154&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02bc05241e25485be5db87fa98c24ed94ce5a290)

This new model is expected to **BREAK ALL GPU** **WORLD RECORDS** once again.

[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xtx-reappears-in-a-custom-pc-as-rx-6900-xt-lc](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xtx-reappears-in-a-custom-pc-as-rx-6900-xt-lc)

&amp;#x200B;

**3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution to launch with 44 game developers.**

Latest leak from Vegeta (@Broly\_X1) published by videocardz.com has AMD launching FX SR on 7 games **next Tuesday**,  with 12 games coming SOON and 44 game studios CONFIRMING to support  AMD's FX Super Resolution (Capcom, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Warner  Bros., Valve, etc.).

This is **AMAZING** news.

In essence, ADOPTION is **already a SUCCESS**. Software developers will push AMD FX SR to GPUs, APUs, Consoles and mobile phones (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S22).

[44 developers already backing AMD FX Super Resolution!!!](https://preview.redd.it/lufh7pwfbw571.png?width=1309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2af3cb2219e4ca6071d681d04fc24db0633db79a)

&amp;#x200B;

**4- Xilinx acquisition update: UK regulator to respond within 3 weeks.**

The  Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of the UK is planned to provide  a phase 1 decision on July 6th in connection to AMD‚Äôs acquisition of  Xilinx.

[https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/advanced-micro-devices-inc-slash-xilinx-inc-merger-inquiry](https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/advanced-micro-devices-inc-slash-xilinx-inc-merger-inquiry)

As per Jim Cramer‚Äôs Mad Money Lighting Round **YESTERDAY** (see video below) he expects the acquisition to trigger the stock to breakout and keep soaring.

Watch video here: [https://youtu.be/QT5YDHmDpGk?t=140](https://youtu.be/QT5YDHmDpGk?t=140)

[YESTERDAY - Jim Cramer confirms expectation AMD to SOAR after Xilinx](https://preview.redd.it/7kj8xnfjbw571.jpg?width=1272&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f87b2c5ebce97700f0b35c488154ac25334821f)

&amp;#x200B;

**5- AMD AM5 platform to launch Mid-2022 (3D cache CPU‚Äôs by end of 2021):**

As reported by RedGamingTech, AM5 is expected in Q2 and AM4 B660 in Q1.

[https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195](https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195)

In  essence, the AM4 will be the most successful platform in modern desktop  consumer history, with a new chip coming, with up to 15% performance  BOOST vs. AMD's AMAZING Zen 3 (5000 series).

But THAT'S NOT ALL, as in Mid-2022 Zen 4 is expected. With higher IPC, in the 5nm process, DD5 memory support and MORE CORES!!!

**To recap:**

AMD to continue **LEADING** the DATACENTER: **Check - all systems go!**

AMD to break more records with new GPU launch: **Check - all systems go!**

AMD to successfully deploy FX Super Resolution Software: **Check ‚Äì all systems go!**

AMD to continue soaring with Xilinx: **Check ‚Äì all systems go!**

AMD upcoming launch on track: **Check ‚Äì all systems go!**

AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:

* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue
* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)
* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion
* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago
* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share
* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY
* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin
* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY
* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future

"I believe AMD will take off to $40+ near/post earnings.Reasoning:

I follow /r/buildapcsales and am avid techie. Was part of the mining craze in 2016. I haven't seen GPU's and CPU's sell out this fast since mining craze in 2016.

This quarter, AMD released 2 huge market share eaters:

* 5700 and 5700 xt gpus

* Zen 2 series

5700 series gpus are eating market share from Nvidia, but not as aggressively as Zen 2 generation CPUs have been absolutely demolishing Intel. There is a competing CPU for pretty much every mid/high range CPU Intel has released. If you compare Intel and AMD there is almost a reversal in trends.

Both of these (CPU and GPU) are far superior for the price to performance ratio in the PC market. Scalpers have been buying up the CPU's and reselling on ebay at a higher price because that's how in demand these CPU's are. There has not been actual sales or deals on these CPU's other than things that are done through the platform selling the product (like Google first time purchase), and still these things sell out in minutes every time at full price.

Additionally, I took a look at the price history, and although i know fractals are usually bullshit, just for fun:

"$SPY - Predictions for the week of 5/16I will admit it üòÇ, the prediction was wrong last week... I thought that a local bottom would be found at least at the beginning of the week, and there would be a decent bear market rally.  SPY dropped to a local bottom on Thursday at much lower than I expected.  

&amp;#x200B;

The S&amp;P 500 dropped 20% from all-time highs for a few ticks on Thursday, which means we are ""technically"" in a bear market now.  There really is something interesting about the 20% drop though.

Not only the United States economy is experiencing issues with monetary policy.  Inflation is starting to cause issues everywhere across the world, seriously this is happening everywhere.  Countries are starting to limit their exports because of how bad shortages are getting.  

When Russia invaded Ukraine their wheat supply was completely cut off, India stepped up and started exporting more wheat, and people's fears of shortages faded away.  This is gone now, yesterday India just shut off all wheat exports to save it for their own citizens.  Inflation is accelerating at dangerous levels when the global economy is slowing.  I think that a 100bp rate hike is necessary but Jerome Powell does not have the guts to do that.  By the June meeting, a 75bp rate hike will be expected.

 The global economy is getting worse and worse.  I expect stocks to rebound this week though.  The bond market finally reached this trend line which has indicated every other past recession.  Usually, there is one final rally after the bond market tops though.  The market definitely will not reach near all-time highs but at this point, a bear market rally is extremely likely.  

I still believe there will be a huge panic sell but that day is for sure not next week.  It will happen when wall street realizes that the world economy is slowing down.  I stand with my previous time of early June when this will occur.

If you buy a car from GM today you are paying thousands of dollars to the dealership, union pensions and long-term healthcare costs, marketing and for fucking every other thing they come up to spend it on.   TSLA cuts out all those costs and sends those dollars to the stockholders.  This is the chance to buy the General Motors of our generation and ride it for the next 30 years.

"Weekly Risk Ranges for TSLA, AAPL, SPY, QQQ, IWM, GOOG, MSFT, AMZNIf this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.",0

"PLTR used to bust NFLX insider traders.WSJ recently published an article detailing the SEC‚Äôs bust of three current and former Netflix engineers for insider trading. 

Cool story right bro?

The cool part is that PLTR was used to detect the suspicious trades. From the article:

‚ÄúA unit of the SEC un¬≠cov¬≠ered the trad¬≠ing ring by us¬≠ing data-analy¬≠sis tools to iden¬≠tify the traders and the cash kick¬≠backs they pro¬≠vided, the agency said in a state¬≠ment.‚Äù

We know the SEC has a contract with PLTR. This is yet another example of the versatile platform PLTR provides for data analysis. 

We had to come back to Earth to scoop up Branson and Bezos, but we‚Äôre on our way back to the moon. üöÄ üåù

EDIT 2: Ok apparently still getting lots of doubt from the same group that thinks Lil Yachty dropping an album causes the SPY to go down. Let‚Äôs have another exercise in deduction. If the SEC uses data analysis tools to detect insider trading and Palantir has a contract with the SEC to develop tools to detect insider trading, then the software the SEC uses to detect insider trading is F‚Äôing Palantir! üñçü•¥",1

"AMD Near Support at $100. Swing Trade Possibly? 2-3 Month TimelineI am not in this trade yet since I think it will bear trap around $99.50 first but I think AMD is primed to bounce off that $100 support area.  If you take a look at AMD from Sep 2020 - May 2021 it also had a base of $74 for awhile.  After that support held, it went from $74 to $122 in 3 months.  That's a solid return for a 3 month swing.  If you held even longer you would have been able to sell at $160 which is more than double your initial investment.  If AMD goes below $95 then I'm out for a loss.

I'm not that patient but I will look to go long AMD around $99.50 and have a target out around $130.  The other 25% I don't sell I will hold on to for the retest of previous highs from December.  Thoughts?

"Don‚Äôt get lured into buying aaplSo you‚Äôre thinking why tf is aapl going up so much when everything else is down?

Answer: On rumors. 

Yes you read that right! 
People are betting on apple beating earnings in 2 weeks when they release their report based on a fake analysis. 
What‚Äôs the rumor about? Well apparently chinese people are dying to buy iphones. They are literally killing each other to get an iphone. 

But wait. Isn‚Äôt the asian market known to always want the best product configuration available for the cheapest price? I.e their iphones have dual sim slot, their androids have the fastest processors. While in the west people are happy with what they get. 

Let‚Äôs look at apple today and their future line up. Their core business is still the iphone, their next line up iphone 14 will have the old. A15 chip that‚Äôs already in the iPhone 13. 
Their new macbook air base model 256gb has a 30-40% slower ssd than the last generation but with a rougly 30% price spike. You really think the asian market is gonna buy any of these products?

Why would apple do that? Why are they selling the new air with old ssd and a huge price? Well they are sitting on a huge inventory not able to sell those parts off so they have to recycle them as long as possible. 

What are the possible outcomes: 
1. Apple beats earnings by 10%: dump incoming as people expected more and it was already priced in
2. Apple earnings estimates are correct: huge dump incoming
3. Apple misses earnings estimates completely: astronomical dump incoming 

Tldr: Smart money is putting out rumors so they can dump their stack on retail. Big dump expected even before earnings in 2 weeks.",0

I was drunk and decided, what the hell, my first trade with be SPY yesterday calls after drinking a lot.  For once drunk me did something good!  So I bought 300 calls on the 16th at .67.  I bought 21.  After being at work for a few hours this morning I remembered I did it and sold 14 at 42% gain.  I kept the remaining 7 just to see what happens.  I then watched it run up to 134% gain at close with a close price of 300.31.  After hours I see it skyrocketed to 302 in after hours.

So a. I feel like a moron not going full HAM and watching the rise (which I am sure this community is disappointed in) and b.  should i just ride the wave and finally c.  if i wanted to hedge, would puts be a good idea now and still keep a great gain with what I have left on it?

# Friday‚Äôs Trade Recap

Took the day off.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&gt;US stocks ended the day with a slight gain, despite Federal Reserve warnings that more policy tightening was on the way. Oil futures fell on indications that the market is currently oversupplied.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The S&amp;P 500 index gained 0.5% on Friday to finish the week down 0.7%, while the Nasdaq 100 fell 1.2% in the previous five days. Trading volumes were low during Friday's $2.1 trillion options expiration, which is typically a day when volatility spikes as traders and dealers rebalance their large exposures.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Treasury yields rose again on Thursday following hawkish remarks from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said interest rates needed to rise to at least 5%-5.25% to curb inflation.   
&gt;  
&gt;Similarly, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari stated on Thursday that it is a open question how far the central bank needs to go with rates to bring demand back into balance.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Continuously rising interest rates are already putting pressure on global demand. Copper and Oil prices, which are sensitive to growth, were set to fall for the week due to concerns about a worsening outlook. For the first time in nearly a year, US Crude futures indicated an oversupply. Higher mortgage rates slowed sales of previously owned US homes for the ninth consecutive month in October.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
However, some equity investors believe that hawkish Fed commentary does not necessarily imply that rates will peak at higher levels than previously thought. And traders remain confident that the Fed will reverse course and begin cutting rates in late 2023.

# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I SPY TA - Monday November 21, 2022

Week of November 21 fluid expectation from option ai.

We are ABOVE the **20 MA (385.82)** and will be key for bulls to hold above next week. We do have the **200 MA at 405.01** and is an upside target if we continue this rally rest of month.

* Downside targets:
   * 395.19
   * 390.08
   * 384.96
   * 377.69
* Upside targets:
   * 401.51

We are near the backtesting failure swing on RSI. Still within striking distance of the 200 MA. It will be key for bulls to hold the gap and/or 20 MA next week if we continue to see downside.

## 20 MA Support Retest on the Menu?

200 MA has been a tough nut to crack this year. We do have a potential end of year rally to 420 - 430. Personally don think we see over 410 - 412 but let‚Äôs see how end of year plays out.

Now just waiting for bullish confirmation for the next leg. Be mindful that this is where we could see a reversal. We might find something similar to July before the next move up or down here.

Upside targets:

* 407
* 412
* 420
* 430

Bold highlights the current weekly range that options ai is estimating.

"NVDA benchmarks results are better than expected!The performance of the new turing cards are out and reviewers are recommending that most gamers pick up the older generation of cards.

This outcome is so much better for shareholders than most people probably realize! There are a lot of comments across several platforms where people are claiming to have cancelled their preorders for the 2080ti and are picking up a 1080ti instead; however, if you check out tracking websites, such as nowinstock.net, the 2080ti is still sold out. Additionally, the 2080 is sold out at many vendors, but not all.

The people that don't care about blowing a lot of money on new tech (myself included) for less than linear performance gains will buy the new cards in great enough numbers. While the normies that don't want to spend that much for the top of the line will deplete the supply of the old generation of cards. Then after the old cards are gone, the turing cards will come down in price and capitalize on the people that were holding out for the price drop.

Additionally, the new architecture seems poised to be much more powerful for the professional market (with the non-gaming cards) with the addition of AI focused cores. It seems similar to AMDs development of Ryzen-TR-EPYC as a ""glued together"" scalable architecture. Not exactly the same, but primarily developed for higher end, higher margin markets (data center) while able to provide value to regular consumers.

The stock price has not caught on yet, and may continue to fall over the next month, but this is good for NVDA. I'm calling 300-315 by Janurary.",0

My strategy was simple, buy the shares, sell a covered call expiring in 2024.¬† The time value of the premium paid is intense.¬† Representing a nice gain if the sale happens.¬† If the deal was going to fail, because of antitrust I believe we would've found out in July (spoiler alert: we didn't).¬† With all the volatility look at what's happened to the stock... slow gradual move up. 

My boy Buffet dropped 9.1 billion on the stock.¬† 

I've tripled my position and have plans to increase it next week.¬† There's still a shit load of room between here and $95 a share.¬†

Again, if I'm wrong I'm hedged to the tits, but collected $3800 in premium.¬† If the deal fails it works out to &gt; 6% annually.¬† If the deal closes in 23' it'll be closer to 17%.

"$SPY - Predictions for the week of 6/13&amp;#x200B;

Simple TA I will be watching

Resistance Area \~432 \~412

Strong Support Area \~388

RSI &lt; 10 is very oversold (currently a weak indicator though)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lzjz4qkkw0591.png?width=1423&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5c6ffe32014f2be393db93cb1b22d3e153cd1d

After $SPY was rangebound for over a week there was finally a breakout led by negative news.  Some people are not realizing how bad the 8.6% CPI report was... the highest analyst estimate was 8.5%.  Our government is not being honest about the current economic situation (not that I would expect them to be).  The federal reserve has been consistently wrong about inflation over the past 2 years.  There is one thing that they are being honest about, inflation needs to be brought down fast.  Jerome Powell already knows he needs to save reserve currency status and bring down inflation as fast as possible.  

&amp;#x200B;

[1 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/l99m90dxx0591.png?width=1479&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ac8bd7ba32d355e0f2708a9f72cac2a26df7b74)

The bond market has always been a very good indicator of what the federal reserve will follow for the effective rate.  The 6-month and 2-year yields are what I like to check.  

&amp;#x200B;

[1 Month Chart](https://preview.redd.it/9f10iba901591.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ada35e9b96a8b4f2a8975ab47a2d2a61bde5d98)

The goal is for the effective rate to reach the 6-month yields, a spread of more than 50bp in the 6-month yields and effective rate will most likely signal a rise in rates.  There are 2 possibilities for next week when Jerome Powell decides how much to raise rates (Purple Line - 75bp rise, Blue Line - 50bp rise).  At the current 6-month yield a 50bp rate hike would equal a 46bp spread from the 6-month yield.  I think the federal reserve will be watching what the equity markets are anticipating... shown above if the 6-month price continues to drop and the yield increase to around 2.23% then I will say there is a 99% chance of a 75bp rate hike.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m9tgyaf931591.png?width=551&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7de398e8afd784af07e63ebfbd7d1bb8210fd65

The 30Y - 5Y bond yields were also inverted this week,  the bond market always shows the economy's health... and right now it is warning of a recession.   

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pht8ks04a1591.png?width=1362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ca461acebd5b28e07faafee5ef19ef14c0773ef

Another problem is that our government thinks the economy is strong, this is because consumers keep spending and spending.  This spending is not lasting though and has started to slow down from inflationary pressures.  People are now borrowing money and using their savings just to keep up with inflation.  This cannot last much longer.  

&amp;#x200B;

[Federal Reserve Calander](https://preview.redd.it/wjuyr99lf1591.png?width=623&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef02627fc8e7e7291768fc110d2675623a4d522b)

Also, 8:30 AM on Tuesday is PPI

**Recap**

$SPY should be rangebound again this week, there shouldn't be any closing price under 388 or above 400.  If 6-month yields rise to about 2.23% expect a 75bp rate hike, otherwise 50bp.

Roku - Integration of Apple TV is a great addition to compete with Amazon Video, Netflix, and Disney. Roku on it's own is a cat - never dies, always recovers, and always makes you shake your head when you miss out on the pumps. Historically, if you look at ROKU, big green days generally run for about 3 days before it subsides and another pump follows. 

AMD - They have earnings coming up soon. Last ER, both Lisa and Devinder were confident on positive cash flow. With the new lineup that was released this year, the numbers should look nice. Especially with holiday seasons coming, the next quarter will be even more exciting for those holding far out calls.

PCG - Well, they are in a shithole. But, the company has everything under control. I hear people talking about bankruptcy without understanding the function of it and how common it is for a company to do this. PCG is fundamentally okay. Gov. Newsom wanted to list the company for buyout and PCG refused the offer, arguing that they will be cover by year's end.

WDAY - Overly bearish sentiments by analyst that really had nothing to say other than the delays. Yes, delays are not great for business, but -20% for an expected lower revenue? LOL come on.",0

As far as I can tell as long as you don‚Äôt buy short term expiry calls it literally cannot go tits up.

"3/17/22 SPY Daily TA- Is the bull run officially back on?Is the bull run back on? Or is this market makers playing games? You be the judge‚Ä¶ 

Statistically speaking if spy opens red there is roughly an greater than 80% chance that SPY will also close red that day. Today we see that statistics are not always correct and why we have to put our biases behind us and focus on what the intraday chart shows us. 

https://preview.redd.it/t29y4wywd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fe03fe32bd95699cd83928143af59bb99b1163e

Looking at this intraday chart you can see that as soon as market opened the bulls came out swinging and they never really let off the throttle till market closes. Looking at the chart now you can clearly see that bulls broke out, rejected the important 437 resistance, regained steam and then blasted through resistance to new highs. I wasn‚Äôt trading most of the day but I like many got burnt thinking the morning rip was the fake out and that we would sell off the rest of the day. Statistically speaking more times than not we would have been correct. Also it really didn‚Äôt seem like it wanted to break through that oh so important 437 resistance. 

Bulls managed to brake this all the way to 441.07 to close here out today for a modest 1.25% gain. However, after hours saw an immediate sell off and is currently sitting between -0.55 to -0.6% right now and using the 8 ema as resistance instead of support. 

https://preview.redd.it/qmhvdfcyd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76c11447d825a6cdb86d84ff82de06da5e359f2d

Looking at my daily chart I can clearly see it is time to make a new channel and see if we can predict where spy is going to go next! Overall the way yesterdays candle finished as a hanging man I am beyond impressed the bulls pushed it green today. Interestingly enough today is technically a hanging man candle also. However, when I look at January 28th, 31st, February 1st and 2nd we actually are seeing a very similar setup today to that. That was the last time there was more than 3 consecutive green candles in a row in over 3 months. Today marks only the second time since December 21st that SPY has managed to have three green days in a row. 

It is also noted that SPY has NOT closed a candle ABOVE the daily 50 ema since February 9th and has only closed one above it (including today) 3 times in over two months. 

This is also the first FULL candle closed ABOVE the daily 20 ema since February 9th and before that it was on January 4th.

Now let me show you a few things I am watching for and seeing on this daily chart as we actually have a few different setups forming. 

https://preview.redd.it/r1nhvmvzd1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57521c5ea38ad089f76e609166469e79a1b1aa8d

First up we have this green channel here which COULD be the start of the bull run‚Ä¶ This channel allows us to move as high as the daily 100 ema before we would see much resistance which is around 445 currently. 

https://preview.redd.it/lixzmov0e1o81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ac86c49e56b8d49e652298c545a7675507100d0

Next we have the red bear market channel. This channel would allow SPY to gap up as high as 445-446 (right around the daily 100 EMA also) before it would see any real resistance. 

Now one other thing that I notice looking at todays chart and why its actually very peculiar to me that we hit 441 intraday and rejected so hard downward after hours is that the previous highest high before today was also right at 441. We are currently seeing a double double top at 441 that would if it holds send us crashing back down. Interestingly enough we also have a double bottom near 415. Which if this plays out correctly we could be seeing the following movements to confirm a massive inverse head and shoulder pattern‚Ä¶

 410 ÔÉ† 441 ÔÉ† 415 ÔÉ† 441 ÔÉ† 410?

If we continue to sell off it would be very interesting if we were to retest 410 from this level if bulls fail to regain strength. This pattern actually played out the exact same back in January/ February. 420 ÔÉ† 458 ÔÉ† 444 ÔÉ† 458 ÔÉ† 410. 

History is not predictive of the future. However, it would be quite amazing to see one month+ longer inverse head and shoulders pattern lead right into another. Overall If spy fails to break higher than 441 tomorrow or beginning of next week I would be watching for the retest of 410 before we go any higher. However, if we manage to get a candle closed at or above 445 I am going to be convinced the bull run is back on (for now). 

I am also watching for the possibility of a future 441 double top too. Currently on that path spy is on if it were to dip into next week but effectively trade sideways (much like it did end of January for its double top) we could beginning of April see a triple top at 441 that would surely cause quite the downside. We definitely have some big levels to watch out for tomorrow and next week. 

Tomorrow is the quad witching day which historically in a BULL market results in a usually pretty red day. However, in a bear market im not quite sure what to expect. Chart wise I would be pretty impressed with a 4th red day but the fact that Mondays low was 415.79 and we closed today at 441.07 means that SPY from Mondays low to todays high has gone up over 5.9%. That is an absolute massive gain for one week. Especially when you factor in that spy up until today had not closed back to back green candles in over a month. But for reference the last time SPY had 4 back to back days of green in a row end of January/ beginning of February spy managed to gain over 7.1% in 4 days. 

The one thing we can guaranteed is that we do not know exactly what the market is going to do and we can only be along for the ride. Many of you probably are thinking its time to enter puts because surely its going to go back down. But the one thing we have to remember is that stocks historically go up not down. So in the end as much as this is clearly a bear market we are in‚Ä¶ in the end we are fighting the overall bigger bull trend. 

I am staring at this chart looking for confirmation one way or the other and honestly I cant say I have any. If we break 445 I think that is a bigger signal we are back for the bull run but if we were to get back under 420 range I would think we see 400 before we see 460. In the end today was a massive break for the bulls BUT if you remember back to January. February when we had the massive ‚ÄúV‚Äù recovery from 420 the channel resistance we were in broke yet we continued lower. Again history doesn‚Äôt repeat itself but I am seeing quite a few bear case scenarios vs bull scenarios right now. 

The best thing the bulls do have going for them though is that the VIX is still historically higher than usual sitting at 26. Most of the ‚Äúfear‚Äù around FOMC, rate hikes, war, inflation, etc. is truly (from the horses mouth JPOW himself) PRICED IN. So unless something wild and new happens we should see the VIX attempt to lower itself down into the teens again. The natural easing of fear and the VIX returning to its average below 20 should allow SPY to head back near 450-460s. 

I do ponder if we see a return to a short lived bull run before the next CPI, FOMC and Rate hike. 

This weeks FOMC minutes release on April 7th. And the next FOMC meeting is April 27th. 

The next CPI is not until April 12th

With all that bulls do have some freedom for the next few weeks to unleash the beast again. Tomororw will be an interesting day with the quad witching though but Monday should start the ‚Äúnew trend.‚Äù

"11-7-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisHope everyone had a great weekend! Spy put in what I would call a bullish day today and one that is hinting a further upside for tomorrow at least. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pv8feaxfrly91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b0e0f0a54553451549071a444463065cf7f3371

Despite the struggle almost all day for SPY to break through 370 resistance we finally saw spy break through before power hour and end the day extremely bullish. The biggest bullish moves today was confirming the daily 20ema as support, closing over the daily 8ema support and closing back inside the green channel. The next step for bulls is to take our 380 resistance that held us up end of day and close over the 50ema. With the black rising wedge still in tact you can see my next target for SPY is that 388.5 to 390 level which I believe we could see before Wednesday EOD. 

However, tomorrow we have to see SPY break through 380 which is where that red resistance line for the pre fomc/ fomc sell off intersects. Once we break through that then this sell off from CPI is effectively over and we can look for some upside. However, if bears manage to hold us under 380 we could see a potential double top at 380 and look for a closure back under 378 which then would show signs of weakness for Wednesday. 

Support- 378 -&gt; 376.2 -&gt; 374.7 -&gt; 371.4

Resistance- 380 -&gt; 384 -&gt; 388.6

Futures is holding within the blue rising wedge still also. It‚Äôs a little hard to tell but I highlighted in purple that key 3805 level which futures if finally going to close over (this is much like 378 for spy). With this closure it opens us up for the next key level of 3925. 

If 3805 is lost and especially closed under again tomorrow then we will look for a retest of the mid to lower 3700s. 

Key support- 3805 -&gt; 3750 -&gt; 3675

Apple despite looking extremely weak this morning on more china news managed to pull out a green day with a nice hanging man candle finish and still maintained a closure over 138.1 support. Though Apple barely scrapped by with a green day apple will look to test that steep red bear channel resistance tomorrow. If they can break through 139.9 resistance it should open up some more upside and possibly look to see that 145 gap fill. 

Key support- 138.1 -&gt; 137.1 -&gt; 135

Key resistance- 142.1 -&gt; 145

And then there was Tesla‚Ä¶. She giveth and she taketh just as fast. I mentioned that pretty massive diamond pattern that hard formed on tesla last week and we officially did break through the support line and now only that we broke all the way through the red sideways channel. I took a pretty big L on my tesla calls (shoulda closed for break even at open) today looking for a recoil off the lows like it has historically done. 

Highlighted by the 4 blue arrows here is the last 4 times a new low was put in. As you can see the following days resulted in pretty impressively green bounces. I am playing some calls for that historical bounce. With a new 52 week low put in and seemingly no catalyst for further dropping I like the odds of a bounce at least beast to reconfirm 205.6 as resistance. However, if we see further sell off tomorrow I will accept my loss on it. The 15min chart is forming a nice 197 double double bottom. 

Key support- 197 -&gt; 193.3 -&gt; 184.3

The VIX seemingly continues to point to more upside to come. Which is actually fairly impressive considering CPI is in 3 days now. I would have expected to at least (though we did at open) see some fear being put back into the markets. However, we actually formed a bearish daily engulfing candle (bearish because its red but for SPY this would be bullish). We also continue to reject the daily 8ema on the VIX. I mentioned last week that premiums are very cheap for longer DTE right now but I believe you are way too early to be going long as the VIX hasn‚Äôt hinted at any sort of upside in weeks. Actually what is even more impressive of the last 20 trading days‚Ä¶ the VIX has either closed red OR closed &lt;1% green. The fear in this market is gone right now. Which leads to me show this next chart. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfln1xilrly91.png?width=606&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e379545443901d6c0c50c5a1f720a6322505f6c6

Looking at the fear and greed index‚Ä¶ we are actually at the highest level of greed that we have been at since January of 2022. Which for those of you who forgot‚Ä¶ from January 4th (about peak of the greed of 65) to January 27th (roughly the bottom of the greed index of 20) SPY fell from 479.98 to 420.76 or fell $59.22 and 12.4%. 

The current FG index reading is 61. The January 4th peak was 65 before it dropped us to a fear of 20. The April peak hit 62 before it finally sold of and dropped us to the May 12th fear level of 3 (wow). August 12ths peak hit 68 before it dropped us to our September 30th low of 15.  

Januarys drop= 12.4% drop over 13 days  
 Aprils drop= 16.7% drop over 32 days  
 Augusts drop= 17.4% drop over 32 days  
   
 

That would mean we COULD be gearing up for roughly a 15.5% drop over the next about 26 days‚Ä¶ that would give us roughly a drive target (from todays close) of 321.06 by December 12th‚Ä¶. 

Now hear me out on this one which is even more WILD‚Ä¶ December 12th is the next CPI reading (after this Thursday) and then FOMC is on December 13th (the day after)‚Ä¶. Is it possible that we are about to see a top put in this week and this CPI is about to start a slow bleed down to 320 over the next month? Its possible‚Ä¶ 

Something to consider for this CPI that is coming up here in 3 days now. I still favor as I said last week a green Monday and Tuesday (half way there) followed by either a green or red Wednesday which would most likely result in a nice inside day. Then Thursday is going to be a huge miss on CPI ( analysis was posted to the server on my trade plan). This huge CPI miss could have the weight to start the next leg down on SPY especially depending on what happens with the mid term elections this week. 

Daily log- 

Today was my first red day since I believe September 1st. Didn‚Äôt miss it by much but red nonetheless. I held my tesla call far too long and should have realized that loss much faster. I also had another break even attempt to exit it this morning and failed to take it‚Ä¶ though I wouldn‚Äôt have pinned tesla for a new 52 week low today at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

Something important to keep in mind with red days is that we can not let a day be so red that it makes not only the day but the week red. For me despite the bigger loss this week easily will be a green week if I continue to trade well. Another thing that many traders make the mistake of doing is revenge trading. They see that red day and think dang it I really need to get green today let me force this trade or let me do XYZ and they end up turning a manageable red day into a unmanageable red week. 

The best thing to do is start the day fresh. Every day is a new day and every week is a new week‚Ä¶ every trade is a new chance‚Ä¶ If you had a great win or a huge loss on your last trade, day or week we can not let that sway us or change or mechanics. 

Something I am going to intertwine on my level to level plays is a -25% stop loss on all plays. If they play is done correctly then If it hits that red I was wrong and it wont really come back to life. Trading a longer DTE on these allows for plenty of movement before -25% ever happens. This was the struggle I always had with scalps before I set a mechanical stop loss was that I would marry my play. I don‚Äôt want to get in a habit of that with these level to levels even though I know sometimes they need time to mature‚Ä¶ this COULD result in a lower win rate as I may stop out more BUT for instance today had I stopped out on my Tesla and SPY level to levels that closed very red I would have ended up very green today. 

Actually had a capped my L2L plays at -25% today for the two losers I would have only closed down -$50 for my L2L plays and with my $1249 from scalps today woulda ended the day up $1199 instead im ending it down about $103.

We have been stuck in a consistent down trend on AMD for about 3 months.

The stock opened with a small gap down, my first idea was to take the stock from a resistance level created in the last few days at $94 together with the descending trend line with a target at $92.3.

The trade was unsuccessful, and the stock took me out with a stop after twenty seconds of my entry.

I knew it was not the right timing and my idea was still valid so I continued to follow the stock, after a few minutes the stock stopped at the $95 resistance level and continued to fall to $94, broke the level, and consolidated below it, I entered orders:

Entry: $94

Stop loss - $94.37

Take Profit Point - $93.27 (2:1 RRR) I identified a level after the losing trade from the pre-market and that is why $92.3 was not the take profit point.

"Multiple-pointed plan to get TSLA back to $280 by next FridayElon Musk is a man who can be influenced. His shareholders are the people most likely to grab his attention. Yesterday, ya boy (me) bought two calls that expire next week‚Äîtherefore I am a shareholder and Elon will care about me...then I can influence him.

I have compiled a comprehensive list of multiple-pointed plans that can help us influence Elon Musk to give us some tendies. You need to understand that Elon is like a reverse vending machine that gives you money, and right now he‚Äôs just broken‚Äîso we need to influence him and get back to getting tendies.

**Plan A:** Get him to call someone a pedophile on Twitter. Simple, yet effective. Just tweet him a question about Jeffery Epstein and sit back and watch. (Chance of success: 88% // Estimated price movement: $56)

**Plan B:** Find him in person and ask him to buy shares of TSLA. Elon is a great guy, he cares about us. So when you see him, sit down and have an intimate conversation with him. Ask him to buy a few million shares. Gently rub his thigh. If worse comes to worse, he might just hand some cash and tell you to find a motel for the night. Best case scenario, he hands you cash for a motel, and then tweets about how you might be a pedophile. (Chance I‚Äôd success: 100% // Estimated price movement: $51)

**Plan C:** Ask Elon to print Beyond Meat out of the TSLA CD trays. Nobody uses CDs anymore, creating new forms of mass and printing food out of it is the new rave. Turn those CD trays into chemically grown meat buffets. May not work if Tesla‚Äôs do not have CD trays, but maybe an external part that can connect via Bluetooth or USB would work. Coin flip Chance at success, but massive gainz. (Chance of success: 50% // Estimated price movement: $600+)

**Plan D:** Convert Teslas to run off of coal. The president is a massive supporter of coal, and we have all this coal laying around that nobody uses anymore‚Äîmaybe daddy Elon should use it to run his cars. No more charging stations, no more coal plants closing. The president will definitely make this a law if we tweet some solid memes at him. (Chance of success: 71% // Estimated price movement: $12)

**Plan E:** Drug Elon and video tape it. This worked for Joe Rogan when he was a desperate bagholder. Now he owned a Tesla‚Äîthink about that. TSLA price skyrocketed out of sheer pity for Elon after seeing him drugged like that. Better drugs may yield better results. Nobody really knows. (Chance of success: 100% // Estimated price movement: $90)

Any one of these will bring us the tendies back. Elon cares about all of us shareholders. We just need to connect with him on a personal level.",1

Classic spy today with about 11 reversals‚Ä¶ Morning started off hella bullish with that 1%+ green open and we even tested the major resistance of 416.6. It looked like we were early on consolidating ready to bust through resistance and finally see the 420s‚Ä¶ Well low and behold we were actually preparing to dump the rest of the day. Somehow SPY still managed to pull out a green day. Its actually funny because these bearish days are being masked by a small green day close. 

In the last month we have had 11 of these non trend days &lt;1% +/- and only had 10 trend days &gt;1% +/-. Overall that‚Äôs 50% of the time that SPY is finding itself in some sort of chop. 

https://preview.redd.it/911ikptmp2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f614968318013f986d5d5bc99683faa04c288746

Daily wise we DID break the bull channel support. However, there is a case to be made for slight error adjusting the bull channel down to look like this. 

https://preview.redd.it/j77euqenp2491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaa329e4ef482cd30597a2ca41fc7199a764c908

As you can see the more important thing we see here today is the purple downward channel. As you can see we are stating to make lower highs now. We are yet to make a lower low which would happen if we break 406.93 this week. This is using the sideways chop from May 27th to present. 

I will closely be watching the black bull channel and the purple channel tomorrow. If we are to drop another candle below the black support line which would happen unless SPY see another large gap up above 413.7 tomorrow (key resistance from 2pm today). And bulls would have to run all day long with no stop to keep us in the black channel. If this black channel breaks tomorrow I will start to look for the next leg down. Which with CPI on Friday its highly likely we will see it very soon. 

Purple channel gives resistance at 416.2 and support at 404.3.

409.4 remains major support though.

Monitoring the VIX you will see that we today broke through the downward resistance line. We are finding ourselves at a break out back to 30 or break back down to 20 trend here. We did break through resistance today so one could assume we are going to see 30 by EOW especially when we look at CPI on Friday. Now the one thing to note is that since Thursday we have been stuck in this 24.8 to 25.8 chop zone. The VIX cant quite unwind and the VIX cant quite rocket up either. Until we see a close back under 24 or back over 26.5 I don‚Äôt think SPY is going to see this sideways chop and reversal happy days stop. 

Today is another one of those days that drive you nuts. Everything and all your indicators are firing and looking perfect the trend looks as trendy as it cant and you enter seconds before a fat reversal. I am still not quite sure this morning what caused that 11am dump nor the nearly 1% spike on the VIX. But that moment cause SPY to go into a downward trend. At 2pm the volume and momentum was all there for a recovery too and yet again got clapped down quickly. 

my best advice right now... is bunker down if you are struggling.... cut your position size by 1/5th and just vibe... dont trade unless you feel 10000% confident in your position. If you dont want to risk anymore get a TOS paper account. There is no reason in this market not to take a break from real money... we need to protect our accounts and our futures... we can not make bad choices that lead to accounts getting blown up. 

Today and friday i am afraid is alot of what we are going to see for the next months or so until either SPY finally reaches capitulation OR we finally recover from inflation and markets feel confident feds not going to crash this market. we are close to neither of these and until we see one of these play out most days we are burning money. 

We need to go heavy on the one trend day we get (those 3-4% days and go beyond light on fuckery days like this). It appears to me that if we are not seeing VIX fully track with the trend (so vix up and spy down‚Ä¶. Vix down and spy up) that we are going to be stuck in chop. With CPI coming up on Friday it will be very interesting to see what the markets are going to do especially with FOMC following up 3 days later. 

I am having a hard time being bullish or bearish here. I think personally we are going to chop in this 407 to 417 range until Friday and that‚Äôs going to decide whether we are going to 440 or whether we are going to 360 again. 

10% challenge-

Overall got burnt on some calls this morning when I was looking for the 416.6 breakout and from there it was just an untradeable day. Made two small scalps and that was it. Looking forward to cpi and fomc being overing and hopefully getting back to some trend days this month. I don‚Äôt really care if its up or down just give me some sort of direction.

"The very important difference in TSLA and GME/AMC that people overlook.So a lot of people point to GME being a cult which is why the price will keep going up because TSLA is the OG Daddy of cult meme stocks. The thing people seem to be missing is Tesla the company had a cult around it before the stock had a cult around it. People stan for Tesla and TSLA. No one and I mean no one stans for Gamestop. GME? People non stop shill and stan on that shit, but Gamestop not the Ticker but gamestop does not have a cult fanbase surrounding it. AMC is just a heaping pile of dogshit but the same logic applies. 

You GME retards do not have the same protection TSLA retards have because your company doesn't have a cult, only your ticker does.",0
"TSLA Investor, new to wallstreetI worked for Tesla since the beginning. 

I don't work there now but have a considerable amount of stock in the company. I could potentially retire in my 30s if I play this right, so I'm here to learn the game. Ide like to start learning about investment strategies and the wild world of Wallstreet. 

A financial advisor wants to get their paws on my accounts but according my last inquiry with this group, that may not be the best bet.

"TSLA short squeezeAs of 6/28, short sellers haven‚Äôt even started to cover their positions.  They maintained their record high $10.1 BILLION bet against Tesla. This represents 31% of float.

How much money they lose this quarter doesn‚Äôt matter.  They are a growth company revolutionizing an industry for Christ‚Äôs sake.  The fact that media / bears have turned to focus on profitability is telling that they are out of ammunition.

AMD, yeah remember the company everyone seemingly forgot about despite posting huge growth consistently in 2020? Well they recently had earnings and suffered bigly along with most tech. Some highlights from their earnings:

* Record revenue for the year with $9.76 billion in revenue
* Q4 Revenue up 53% to $3.244 billion (also record quaterly revenue)
* Gross profit up 53% to $1.451 billion
* Net income up to $1.78 billion compared to $170 million a year ago
* EPS up 867% (yes that is right) to $1.45 per share
* Cash flow up to $554 million YoY
* Q1 2021 guidance: 3.2B in revenue (79% YoY) and 46% gross margin
* FY'2021 guidance: 37% increase in revenue YoY
* Lets not forget their recent acquisition of Xilinx that will put them in a great position for the future

Getting back into the swing of things today has some Thursday and Friday combined dejavu vibes going on. Overall made out decently for a short trading day for me today cause of the kiddos. 

Big red open today‚Ä¶. Turned into a decently green day for SPY.

So what did we learn? Anything? 

https://preview.redd.it/qdlxcntnzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb40df51ffba6704eb44025b19b2fffe35d42154

On the SPY daily we had that massively tight and aggressive black dotted rising wedge form last week. Well today we saw SPY poke its head over that black dotted resistance line. We also perfectly rejected the 429.4 daily resistance level (that‚Äôs the yellowish tan horizontal channel). 

We also saw the support line of that pretty aggressive black dotted bull support line reconfirmed today at open. 

Overall tomorrow or Wednesday is shaping up to be the ‚ÄúD-Day‚Äù where we are finally going to reachout and touch that solid green bear market resistance line. Tomorrow if we get a bullish enough day we are going to test not only the black solid rising wedge resistance but we are also going to test the green solid bear market resistance line at the same time. Could be a very big make or break type of day with it only being 0.6% away from close today. 

Major resistances tomorrow- 

439.3 (daily level resistance) -&gt; 431.8 (bear market resistance and black solid rising wedge resistance)

Major support tomorrow-

427.2 (black dotted support line) -&gt; 424.8 -&gt; 423 -&gt; 421.4 (red solid bull support line)

https://preview.redd.it/y80vmsnozxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95ad6d2814378f99f1b697fb3bc36feb8e0a55f9

Futures is looking pretty similar we see that red solid resistance line broken just barely EOD today and we are holding close to that green solid line. 

Resistance-

4317 -&gt; 4335 (bear market resistance) 

Support-

4296 (blue solid support line) -&gt; 4252 -&gt; 4210 (daily 8ema)

https://preview.redd.it/i4umsbspzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c4fee89dea5d6c4bd33a03f19c5391f114ed3d7

Overall SPY and ES futures weeklies are looking pretty similar. 

Resistance- 

432.5/ 4340 (dotted rising wedge resistance, SPY weekly level resistance, and bear market green resistance)

Support-

420/ 4190

https://preview.redd.it/lm0bglhqzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bf90f67772fa1fedb7b7dae676f861dc4799ec3

Apple is absolutely still a madman running like a chicken with its head cut off. 

Resistance-

174 -&gt; 174.6 (black solid rising wedge/ bear market resistance) 

Support-

173.1 (black extreme rising wedge support) -&gt; 172.1 -&gt; 171

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0e7etn2rzxh91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b9f6b1c912bc471675ce51b53a9e492cf1d0686

Interestingly enough the VIX bounced pretty high today. With a close at 20.34 Friday and an intraday high of 21.74 that was a pretty green open for the VIX. However, like usually throughout the day we saw the VIX slowly unwind and with that SPY go up and up. 

As I mentioned last week im looking for the VIX to break that resistance line and end up somewhere near 22-24 before I assume the top is in. 

Overall I will be looking for Spy to touch that 431.8 (daily) bear market resistance and the 432.8 (weekly) bear market resistance lines tomorrow. A hard rejection at either one of those should be assumed as a great put opportunity. I will be watching the daily level first. If we break through it but don‚Äôt break through the weekly we can assume the next day the weekly resistance will be taken down. However, if we get stopped in our tracks at 431.8 then I am assuming for the time being we are maxing out. 

With the bigger red open today and the early morning chop and weakness and the continued low volume trading I would not be surprised to see a little consolidation and back testing of support at 427.2 tomorrow and actually attempting bear market break out on Wednesday with the assistance of FOMC minutes at 2pm. FOMC minutes is usually a pretty bullish day and movement and we should suspect nothing less in this current environment we are in (TA has been posted to the server on how to trade Wednesday). 

10% challenge-

I didn‚Äôt sit down at the computer till closer to 930am this morning cause it was the kiddos first day of school so was playing a little catch up. Overall I was fairly patient today and only made two trades before I had to leave around 230pm. Short trading day for me but overall a good day. 

https://preview.redd.it/lejru4srzxh91.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d9743f1e9553377371ce5969f579dab24c38012

I know the server has been discussing this but premiums continue to move wildly abnormal. I took that put trade around 1030. I went green instantly and then red. I had my 25% stop limit set which should have triggered at 426.5ish, however, I approached there on a bounce saw about -23% then Spy fell back my direction by about 10 cents and all of a sudden I went from -23% to -10%. SPY then came back to me and I was green before my PUT hit the spot price that I entered at. I bailed pretty quickly on that just cause of the abnormal movement. It was extremely odd. 

My call was just as odd today but it was a TOS issue. I bought 25 contracts and when I sold my bot only showed that 1 contract sold, however, I had the profits from all 25 selling. Even my orders for TOS showed that only one sold. It was an odd day for sure. Thankfully finished all green. 

Days like today though I do not enjoy trading. I didn‚Äôt wanna take calls today cause it was at extreme overbought levels pretty much from 1115 to 1pm when it finally rested. I was comfortable taking the call around 2 when SPY reconfirmed the 8ema as support on the 15minutes and we were showing oversold levels with favorable volume. 

These bull days are even more intense and extreme then the 2021 bull rally was. I was comparing todays and especially Fridays movement to those of 2021 and even the really big days in 2021 (and even in early 2022) that we bullish SPY rested along the way. It would retest the 8ema and sometimes even drop a candle below it. However now we are just seeing these bullish days where the momentum goes green and it never stops and it pretty much negates every indicator out there. And the worse part about it is its not like we have extremely high volume where I can say well yeah everyones buying so it makes sense‚Ä¶ we are just not seeing anyone sell right now is the issue.

"New Intel security flaw. AMD and ARM unaffected[source](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12701) 

(Same researchers as Spectre/Meltdown) 

TL;DR, despite the hardware mitigation on Coffee Lake Intel processors remain vulnerable to out-of-order and speculative execution bugs that can allow untrusted code to gain system access. Unclear if Ice Lake is affected. 

In my opinion as an ECE I think there is a shot of Ryzen 3 beating Ice Lake once all the hardware/software mitigations imposed by the OS's and Intel to deal with all this. Intel has been an industry leader in single threaded performance largely due to their OoE secret sauce and deep instruction pipelines - now these vulnerabilities are negating their advantageous position. With lower clock speeds, larger die size, and fewer cores I would not be surprised if AMD beats Intel in real world benchmarks with same generation processors.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&gt;US treasuries fell and stocks fell after Federal Reserve officials signalled that the central bank will continue to raise interest rates until inflation is under control.  
&gt;  
&gt;Treasury yields increased across the yield curve, with 10-year rates rising as much as 20 basis points to 2.77%. The yen, on track for its fifth daily gain, fell as the dollar reversed four days of losses amid a sharp shift in risk sentiment.  
&gt;  
&gt;The S&amp;P 500 fell for the second day in a row as Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan prompted China to announce missile tests, despite her claim that her visit would not change long-standing US policy in the region. The Nasdaq 100 also fell on the day.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both indexes swung between gains and losses throughout the session as markets remained tense, with geopolitical tensions simmering and Fed officials signalling that a policy shift was unlikely.  
&gt;  
&gt;Investors were kept on their toes by new economic data. According to recent data, US job openings in June fell to a nine-month low, indicating that labour demand is moderating as economic pressures mount. The job market has been a bright spot in an economy that is otherwise losing steam and may be heading for a recession.

"6-23-22 SPY Daily TAWas a little shaky of a day but markets came through after that morning dump to rally and save my morning calls and UVXY puts. 

Overall as I was afraid of markets didn‚Äôt want another JPOW pump and instead were flat af until we finally saw the 11am top and dump. However, we had a beautiful V-shaped bottom though around 1pm that led to an EOD rally hitting my price target of 378.5 before EOD. 

https://preview.redd.it/83kzb2guwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc48fda7e70e9cb9d956e0b996a8fa48ad4556fe

Just a textbook dump and V-shape recovery rally. 

https://preview.redd.it/d0bgwr0vwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e1a62eef9503773dac406bbd5625a3213deb9f

So where are we at on the daily? Well we closed at 378 which is bullish as we finally got away from those 375 closes and closed over resistance. However, thanks to that mid day dump we didn‚Äôt get the 380 run and close over that I was hoping for to feel confident in a bull run tomorrow. 

As you can see I have highlighted the May 12th to May 17th daily candles which look oddly similar to the current June 17th to June 23rd candles. 

https://preview.redd.it/f3tkie2wwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbf2313ea9a297c10dbbf548ef7831138c6b03f9

I am watching this closing as a hanging man daily candle which could signal the top/ a reversal. Last time we had it was on May 17th and it led to a massive -4% day with a -1.2% red open. I have my suspicions that is what we could see tomorrow. We failed once again to break through the daily 8ema today. 

The blue line support from June 17th and June 22nd was broken today (I readjusted it here to see if this will be new support going forward). 

https://preview.redd.it/38q6d9nwwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c38d838515e4c1953a152dfa664fe5f1bc3a2f07

Here is the setup I am watching on the weekly and then ill lay out the bull/ bear scenario. 

Weekly still has the gap from 389.75 to 383.90 and as you can see major resistance is 380 and then 390. I actually was fairly bullish going into today suspecting we would break through 380 resistance and see 390 EOD tomorrow for a nice rejection and weekly gap fill to lead to downside. However that is quite the stretch now. 

Bull case- After a bullish finish EOD today bulls look for a nice continuation tomorrow breaking through 380 resistance and close the week out somewhere in that 380 to 390 range (384 will be resistance after 380 using the June 15th candle). With a close near 384 bulls look next week to see a green week and fill the 390 gap on the weekly. If that gap fills and they can keep the momentum we MIGHT see a run as high as 400-405 next week. 

Bear case- with this hanging man candle on the daily and struggle after struggle for bulls to keep any steam going this week. We either see a confirmed rejection in the morning at 380 or we could potentially like in May see a pretty significant gap DOWN over night and see a bleed back near 370 support to end the week. Ending the week on a bearish tone bears would look to retest the weekly 200ema and 2020 support line at 363 and attempt to break through to start the next leg down. 

At this point it really is bears and bulls neck and neck. I would favor a big red day tomorrow personally. We opened the week at 371.89 so if we do see a bigger -3.4% red day tomorrow we could actually see a support test near 370 to finish the week out red. Most likely scenario is a green week finish to the week. 

https://preview.redd.it/c4x94b8xwg791.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca8200b15bd206658db12d3cacdae7d56817811b

I have been trying to get a read on the VIX all week long but really cant. We have obviously unwound all week long from 34+ on June 17th to now making allow of 28.7 today but we just aren‚Äôt seeing the true unwinding of SPY like we used to on these big bull runs. We are seeing pretty much small movements followed by sideways trending all day. Overall we are pretty much dead smack in the middle of 25 and 35 for the channel with a small favor to the downside. Overall my thoughts are still that VIX wants to revisit 25 support level which would favor the 390 theory but there easily could be a pop back near 33 to 35 VIX which would favor that 370 test. Overall this market is full of mixed signals and multiple scenarios. 

I have said it before but even though we often are missing 1 to 1.5% moves overnight for the most part we are better off not playing swings right now. The market is just far too unpredictable and far too easily swayed to predict a true move right now. Looking back over the last three weeks that I have been tracking my swings my win rate is about 55.5%, however, the last two weeks I have spent 2-3 days recovering the losses from my swings. The first week though that swing gave me a nice reward. It‚Äôs a tough market to be in right now. On one hand we have these wild swings overnight that we can clearly capatlize on for some impressive gains IF we get the right direction and position sizing but on the other hand with the unpredictability of it and the intensity of these swings if you are wrong you are -90% wrong at open.  

Now that we are on the topic of swings lets look at the last 4 weekends and see if there is a play to be made‚Ä¶ its kinda interesting to be honest. 

May 31st- -0.4%

June 6th- 1.1%+

June 13th- -2.6%

June 21st- 1.7%+

As of right now we are seeing every other week a big red then big green open‚Ä¶ so there is a chance we open big red on Monday. Is it worth the play? Perhaps‚Ä¶. Gonna see where tomorrow closes us. 

10% challenge-

I got caught in some SPY calls and UVXY puts this morning before that hard dump. I shoulda mitigated my losses but took a chance it was an over-reaction to JPOW. Waited till the bottom and averaged down the SPY calls and then the UVXY puts once I got out of the SPY calls. I missed an opportunity to take 3% green on the SPY calls but protected myself with a -10% stop loss and triggered that. Unfortunately of course it ran hard af power hour so I missed on the big gains. Overall though I salvaged a really bad day to a really great day today. But I got lucky. I should have better mitigated my losses and taken an L when I saw it go against me and saw that 11am reversal doji. 

https://preview.redd.it/wd1cnuuxwg791.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8a14e7f9e0cd7eea2390a709621961fe7de0e7a

I have had a great week after overcoming my weekend swing big loss. I am at my weekly profit goal currently and I will look to tread lightly tomorrow. Fridays are always tough days and I have seen too many Fridays erase a weeks worth of gains on a bad play. Patience has really paid off for me over the last three weeks and I do not look to change that tomorrow.",0

Motorcyclist dies in I-15 collision with Tesla on autopilot, UHP says

DRAPER ‚Äî A motorcycle rider died after being hit by a car on I-15 in Draper Sunday morning.

The motorcycle was southbound on the freeway near 15000 South when a Tesla hit it from behind about 1:10 a.m., according to Utah Highway Patrol.

The impact from the collision threw the rider from the motorcycle and the rider died at the scene.

The Tesla's driver told investigators he did not see the motorcyclist. The car's autopilot was on at the time of the crash, UHP said.

The motorcyclist's name has not yet been released.",0

$VIAC is making GAMES already!!!! and Btw they are f\*cking popular on Twitch and in Steam - check the screenshot (Twitch) below: ""Nickelodeon All-star Brawl"" = 96.5k viewers &gt; more popular than Fortnite (86.9k), Warzone (70.3k) and FIFA22 (66.5k).

What's wrong with you Apes??? $VIAC is the future of streaming and games, as they have hot ass franchises like Avatar The Last Airbender, South Park, Star Trek, Ninja Turtles and many more... How can $NFLX compete with their shitty Sex Education and Bridgerton bullshit, who even watches that crap??

Here are $VIAC financials for your lazy butts:

$VIAC is currently trades at $39.51 per share with P/E=7.21 and with Profit=$4B and Revenue=$27B and has Strong Balance Sheet of $7B of cash on hand and Assets/Liabilities=2.5, and btw $VIAC pays 2.5% dividend and is selling off Non-core assets like their Publishing business for $2.12B and HQ building to BlackRock for $800m. Clearly, $NFLX with P/E=65 and Revenue=$27B is too fucking expensive. Also, **which event is more likely to happen?** $VIAC going from **$39.51 to $120 (%200 increase)** which will be P/E=20 and market cap $75B, or $NFLX going from **$634.81 to $1,268(100% increase)** which will be P/E=130 and market cap $560B...

"How to play extremely high-risk FDs with 1000% upside. With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I've been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.

Since you all love throwing your money away, I'll share how I play FDs. I cannot understate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won't go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you're serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.

I only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I'll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It's possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I'll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don't go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. 

In my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn't a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you're only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don't mess with FDs if I'm only looking at a realistic upside of 500%.

**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**
-

I haven't bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I've bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. 

So, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn't like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ's results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn't have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.

Thus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.

-

**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you'll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. 

1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. 

2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We're banking on some unexpected volatility. 

3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it's all over. 

4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. 

5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ's average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I'm predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that's more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it's a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ's yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday's close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.

6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren't really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.

-

And now onto the actual play.

* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**

These are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday's closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. 

If this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say ""Wednesday noon"", I don't actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. 

These estimates are going to be off because we're dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you're trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I'm not wrong often.

By the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you're down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.

-

---

---

-

**Apple ($AAPL)**
-

I personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I'll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. 

* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**

These calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. 

Reasoning in decreasing significance: 

1. Apple's earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. 

2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn't only because they're both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. 

3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. 

4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn't a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don't go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. 

5. With the tax cuts and Apple's big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they're good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.

-

As always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there's a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn't go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road. ",0

"2/16/22 SPY: Are we bullish yet?Any investor knows the two most volatile and unpredictable events to trade around is earnings and any sort of fed meeting/ news. Today was no exception. Today we saw yet another trend reversal by the feds. Today was saw red most of the day, though it broke one major support at 443.1 and essentially filled the gap minus a about $0.25... for me thats considered a filled gap. 

2pm brought the release of the fed minutes from last month. Markets seemed to have been bracing for hawkish news however, apparently they digested it as doveish (mostly neutral/ no unexpected news) and the markets saw a 180 recovery. We turned a -0.7% day into a positive day within minutes. However, as quick as we saw the turn around the one thing i did notice was that we QUICKLY loss buyer momentum. Watching the candles and volume ticker move in real time once we high out first major resistance at the notorious 446 range i noticed we very quickly lost momentum and from there we struggled. 

The biggest back and forth tug of war came at the 447 mark. pretty much the whole last hour it was nothing but back and forth. This shows me that despite the ""good news"" catalyst the market ran with there is still far more selling pressure compared to buying pressure. Eventually we started to break down right as market was closing for a hardly bullish but still green 0.11% finish at 446.1.

The nice thing about the last 3 days it has given us a TON of support and resistance lines to watch for future movement. There is no doubt SPY is unpredictable but I am starting to see a few scenarios I think we see play out tomorrow and even into next week. Heres what i am seeing....

On the Daily we did finally see a close above the 8 EMA of 446.16 (barely) however, we failed to break or even reach the 20 EMA (next major resistance line) at 448.73. To me the face that this ""good news"" catalyst wasnt enough momentum to turn a mild red day into a very red day is a big concern. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking intraday I aslo notice volume (especially intraday) appears to be very low. Up until the fed minutes we saw even less volume than yesterday (based off the graph... someone can comment with the true numbers i dont have in front of me). 

So heres where I think we could be going tomorrow and what would make a lot of sense and a few potential plays...

If you look at the daily chart (ignore all the vertical lines i had that different time frames do that to it.... those are actually horizontal support and resistance lines). But i want to point out the black dotted line. That line is the downward resistance line that started in beginning of January and eventually saw us dip to 420. That line is sitting right around 454 right now. 

Scenario 1-

We see another green run up tomorrow to test that resistance line. Would be about a 1.65% run which is very well within range of a normal spy. For this scenario we would see a rejection a hard rejection. This rejection would confirm we are still in a dip/ bearish short term market. We would then finish here with a hanging man candle (most likely scenario) and the following day (friday) would see a massive sell off falling back down to the 447 range first and then continuing downward. Eventually down near 420 for an official retest (I still personally favor a full on retest of this area).

Scenario 2-

Much like scenario 1 we see a 1.65% green day where we test the 454 resistance area. BUT this time we break the resistance line. NOW with this scenario we would HAVE to break 458. If we fail to break 458 we will see a MASSIVE daily chart triple top... I do not need to tell you just how bearish and bad that would be. It is not out of possibility to do it tomorrow but a retest tomorrow of 458 would be 2.5%. However, it is absolutely unlikely in this current extremely low volume and flat market that we see that. Now if the volume magically returns tomorrow well its possible. But again we need to avoid a hanging man candle here and triple top... This scenario would also potentially play out over two days. 

\-obviously if we did triple top at 458 we all know that would be a beyond bearish scenario. 

Scenario 3-

Seeing the intraday chart, especially during power hour, we saw all the buying momentum fade. Its arguable had we not had the fed minutes today we could have had a very very red sell off... and especially if the news had been even remotely hawkish we would have seen a very very red day (near 2% if we assume the same movement it did bullish but inverse). 

\-There is very real possibility that tomorrow we start yet another sell off. Like i mentioned above we failed to break the daily 20 EMA of 448.73. If we see a porlonged dip back below the daily 8 EMA of 446.19 we very well could start to see another sell off. 

Supports

446.2 --&gt; 445.8 --&gt; 445.4 --&gt; 444.8 --&gt; 443.6 --&gt; 442.7 --&gt; 442.3 --&gt; 441.7 (a major support that bulls need to hold) --&gt; 439.7 --&gt; 437

Resistance-

447 (major resistance) --&gt; 448.1 --&gt; 451 --&gt; 454.4 (major downward resistance from january) --&gt; 455.5 --&gt; 458 (needs to be broken to prevent triple top)

&amp;#x200B;

For me I will be looking for a longer term PUT play (Probably at least 14-30 DTE) IF we see a confirmed rejection of 454. If we break through 454 I will wait to see the test of 458. IF 458 is broke I will absolulely be getting some 14-30 DTE calls as there really would be nothing bearish to hold us back until March when they do their first rate hike and have another FOMC meeting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay story time because I will always be honest with you guys about my investments and my P/L.

Many of you who follow me know I was traveling for work today but still was trading. This morning my plan was if we broke 443.1 to grab puts for the gap fill down to 440 area. Well unfortunately i was talking to my girlfriend and missed my entry. In my fustration (first mistake) and rush (2nd mistake) I quickly attempted to jump into a 2/18 442 PUT (we were near 442.8 i think when i did this)... Then to my astonishment i was VERY confused when when we kept dipping to the why my PUT was going red. At first I thought I got a bad fill or something. But then we bounced hard off that 442.3 area and I all of a sudden was in the green again... it then hit me... I MADE A BIG MISTAKE... In my fustration and rush i bought a fricken CALL instead of a put. I nearly shit myself at first. 

However, due to my late entry (and pretty much completely ignoring my own strategy cause i was too distracted) I realized i actually had a salvagable play. I was up 5% at one moment and i was very convinced I was going to sell and just take the W and be okay with my mistake.

I then started to get my head outta my butt and actually look to see what i was seeing. It seemed the gap was going to fill as much as it wanted to and we were reversing. Through a VERY long and stressful day I held my call. never going down more than 15% (did around 1230 when the russia cyberattack news came out). To me that candle seemed sus and an outlier based on the actual trend so i held and it recovered. My stop loss was set at 20% the whole time... 

Now comes the really sketchy part but at this point I had accepted my mistake and was taking it to the fed meeting (I can handle a 20% loss for the potential of a gain here since i have had a great week....). So on my drive there is about a 45 minute stretch where i have no phone service and it just so happens that the 45 minutes brought me right to the fed minutes dropping at 2pm. I hit the service finally right at 2pm to see the massive dip (still had my 20% stop loss so i was safe) and then i saw it flip (like always first reaction is wrong) and it start going to the races. 

Held it all the way to 447 and watched that fight for a solid hour. Finally during power hour when it dipped back below the 447 mark i took profits. Managed to get a wild 43% gainer on a complete honest 100% dumb luck mistake. I am not by any means a lucky person but this is the luckiest this that has every happened to me ever. 

This did teach me a great lesson though. Double check orders no matter how rushed I am, and to always feel confident in the trend and if you miss the entry wait for the next one. This very well could have been a very very very red mistake. And it definitely gut checked me. But i wanted to share this with you as its a mistake any of us could make. And to show i am real and raw with my trades and trading life.

Couple reminders-

I know i made a pre market post today and i did say i would be able to comment much cause i was traveling. I know alot of you were commenting about entries and updates waiting for them. I apologize if anyone missed where I said i wasnt going to be very active due to travels. 

there will be NO LIVE UPDATES INTRADAY until next friday February 25th due to work. I am working the next 6 out of 7 nights and then will be traveling February 24th back home again. The 24th like today will be able to post some some but the rest of the day i will NOT be posting intraday as I work night shift and sleep until 230 and trade power hour. 

I WILL still post my nightly TA and Analysis. 

SOME mornings i will post a premarket update if there is some sort of big drastic move that i feel warrants an update and changes my TA/ Analysis.  

Remember we do not need 50-100% gains every day. We just need 10-20% gains every day and we need to mitigate our losses at 10-20% so they are easily recoverable in a day or two. When we start seeing major losses like 30-50% we have a VERY hard and long grind to gain those back. 

Despite my dumb luck today we HAVE to find the right entry. The right entry will give you a lot of leeway to recover and/ or still salvage a small profit if a trade reverses quickly on you.",0

"TSLA can be the next NFLX IF the spell breaksNFLX remained overvalued for a good 3-4ish years before tanking. The writing was on the wall for a long time (who didn't foresee the rise of competitors?)

Similarly, although TSLA is the pioneer of EVs, competitors are catching up rapidly and will be able to produce vehicles as good as Tesla's in the next couple of years. When they do TSLA, will finally have the long-awaited crash that everyone has been predicting.

The only was I can see Elon getting himself out of this conundrum is if he can make TSLA the next AAPL. That has been his strategy so far, basically to make it a premium brand/luxury good that people will pay for disregarding the cost. It remains to be seen whether he can pull this off.

But if the market starts getting fractured and Tesla can't maintain its dominance, the stock price will crash dramatically just like Netflix did.

He looks you directly in the eye. ‚ÄúBut you've seen me everywhere, haven't you?‚Äù A film projects behind him. Images of rockets exploding, one 65 million dollar failure after another.

‚ÄúI staked my career on colonizing mars. But now my shame will no longer define my legacy. This is the day a Muskrat will rise from the ashes, adorned in its Tesla flightsuit, and ascend to immortality.‚Äù

The heat radiating from his boardshorts evaporates the fluid into steam on contact.

‚ÄúSo I asked myself, what would our heavenly father do?‚Äù He removes his shirt to reveal an elaborate crucifixion tattoo across his veiny, throbbing pectorals, his sandy brown chest hair growing around it in patches. His left nipple replaces the head of Longinus, his right the head of Mary Magdalene.

‚ÄúAnd do you know what he told me?‚Äù He grabs you by the hand. ‚ÄúDo you know the universal secret?‚Äù He briefly fondles your breasts, but you push him away, flirtatiously mouthing no, no, no. You know you want him. But you don't remember how you got here. You don't remember your name. You remember nothing but Elon.

The film changes. Images of an enormous armored vessel. Militaristic on the outside, the interior exudes elegance; full bar, kitchen, gaming tables, and a huge, impenetrable observation window.

‚ÄúOur Father, through his only-begotten son, came before me in a dream. The Almighty and the Christ sat side-by-side in the holiest of holies, the inner sanctum, not of heaven, but of meaning itself. And behold, I saw the Mammon. Truly I say to you, the three were not in bitter dispute, but united together, each an introgial piece of the Holy Trinity, the base-most expression of God.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what did God say to you, big boy?‚Äù You say, playing footsie with his milk-soaked black business socks.

‚ÄúIgnorant harlot!‚Äù He screams, throwing the mug of Cheerios and milk in your face. ‚ÄúDo you desire my milk so badly, you can not discern for yourself God‚Äôs message from this vision?‚Äù You shake your head no, ashamed you've displeased your master.

He rubs your head, massaging the milk on his hands deep into your scalp. ‚ÄúChild, do you wish to possess this esoteric knowledge?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Papi Musk‚Äù, you say. Your conscious mind awakens as you realize you have no control of your actions, words, or emotions. ‚ÄúYour lessons begin now‚Äù, he says, loosening the drawstring on his shorts.

You pull his shorts off and see a large pink udder with four teets stuffed into his Teen Titans Go! boxer-briefs. You lovingly guide a teet through the folds. It's already dripping with pre-milk. ‚ÄúSuck it‚Äù, he says, grabbing your hair and pulling you closer. You obey your master and begin suckling. His warm milk squirts down your throat.

‚ÄúEverybody has a place in the system‚Äù, he says. ‚Äúas ordained by God‚Äôs laws of nature. Even when they seem lost and useless, He appoints a prophet to help them‚Äîto do His will.‚Äù His milk is getting warmer and more viscous.

‚ÄúTruly I say to you, that prophet will channel the Mammon, and through him all people will find their purpose.‚Äù His piping hot milk globs down your throat and scalds your esophagus, but you can't let go of the teet.

‚ÄúThe Tesla Amphibious Observation Vessel. Now the world‚Äôs leaders and innovators have a window into the lives of primitive man, commodifying their existence and finally giving them purpose.‚Äù

The film changes. Images of the vessel in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit‚Äîcrushing cars, busses, and people while Elon, Jeff Bezos, Charles Koch, Oprah Winfrey, and Kanye West peer out the observation window.

"$AMD Q3 2019 Earnings DDPrepare for some serious autism but this is the real deal. AMD has been a powerhouse recently, with Zen 2 stomping **all** of Intel's offerings on **all** fronts (since its release on August 7th): 2X performance at 0.5X the cost and 0.5X the power draw (**big** deal) on the top SKU.

[Source 1](https://www.servethehome.com/amd-epyc-7002-series-rome-delivers-a-knockout/)

*""As I have traveled around speaking to vendors, customers, ISVs, even teams designing hardware for future space missions, there is a common theme: giddiness over Rome [Zen2].""*

[Source 2](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=amd-linux-epyc-7002&amp;num=1)

*""we are talking about something arguably more exciting, or at least the ability to more profoundly impact an industry (data centers): AMD's EPYC 7002 series [Zen 2] is ready and their line-up and ultimately the resulting performance is the most exciting and competitive we have seen ever out of AMD in the server space.""*

This is a colossal shakeup in the industry -- but I can hear doubters shouting ""but Intel's entrenched in the server space! Performance dosen't matter because of partnerships!""

[Google and twitter have announced using AMD's new chips](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/08/amd-shares-surge-14percent-after-google-and-twitter-sign-on-with-epyc-chips.html)

[AWS is using AMD's new chips](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/amd/)

[The military is using AMD's new chips](https://www.nextplatform.com/2019/08/12/us-military-buys-three-cray-supercomputers/)

This shakeup is unprecedented. What about mobile though?

[Just yesterday, Microsoft will reportedly be using new mobile Zen chips in its next-gen Surface devices](https://www.techpowerup.com/259276/microsoft-to-reportedly-use-amd-silicon-on-its-next-gen-surface-devices)

Zen 2 in the desktop space has been selling like hotcakes, and the consensus is there's almost no reason to buy Intel at this moment. Obviously desktop is less important than server and mobile, but it shows consistency and mindshare growth.

AMD continues to lag behind Nvidia in GPU add in boards (AIBs), but it has regained some marketshare with its new 7nm RX5000 series being **very** competitive at their price points.

[Marketshare source](https://www.jonpeddie.com/press-releases/jon-peddie-research-releases-its-global-q1-2019-add-in-board-report/)

To top it all off, AMD's Q2 earnings posted conservative guidance. They've been trading in a channel, leading me to believe **not all of this information is priced in**. AMD is poised for a **massive beat**.

"RIP $NFLXShares of Netflix cratered more than 20% on Tuesday after the company reported a loss of 200,000 subscribers during the first quarter.

Here are the results.

EPS: $3.53 vs $2.89, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts.
Revenue: $7.78 billion vs $7.93 billion, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts.
Wall Street is also watching another key number in the Netflix report.

Global paid net subscriber additions: 2.73 million expected, according to StreetAccount estimates.
Netflix previously told shareholders it expected to add 2.5 million net subscribers during the first quarter. Analysts predict that number will be closer to 2.7 million. Either figure would mark a significant downturn from the 3.98 million added during the same period in 2021.

Investors‚Äô hyper focus on new paying customers led Netflix shares to plummet 20% after the company‚Äôs last earnings report in January. In addition to weaker-than-forecasted fourth-quarter subscriber gains, company executives quietly admitted that competition from other streaming platforms was having a negative impact on its growth.

Netflix has increased its content spend, particularly on originals, amid intense competition in the streaming space. To pay for it, it‚Äôs hiked prices of its service. While the company is exploring other options for growth, like adding video games, analysts and investors are wondering what else Netflix can do to bolster revenue.",0

**Wednesday: (Sideways)**

* Before CPI participants get prepared:
   * Buy puts to protect their long positions 
      * Market maker sells puts (long position) and shorts shares (short position) to get delta neutral 
   * Short stocks 
      * Maker buys shares (long) and buys puts (short) to get delta neutral 
   * Institutions and retail have their cash ready 
   * This interest in puts shows up in the VIX which was elevated all Wednesday going into close. 

**Thursday: (Up 1%, Down 3%, Up 5.5%)**

* Market is closed:
   * Futures drift up on hopium that the report is not as bad as expected 
   * The CPI report comes out and the market drops 3% in the pre-market 
   * The market moves a lot because there is a lot less liquidity, wider bid-ask spreads and the moves become exaggerated 
* The Market is Open:
   * This means the options market is open as well 
   * Put holders sell, this brings VIX down 
      * Market maker closes their short shares position, buying shares 
   * Short sellers close, which is a buy in the market, driving prices higher 
      * Market maker closers their short put positions, which causes others to buy shares 
   * The VIX collapses 
      * This is counterintuitive because normally when SP falls, VIX goes up, but it was the closing of put positions which drove this decline in VIX
   * Investors with cash in the sideline see a new 52 week low, and start to buy 
   * Sellers are overwhelmed by the rebalancing of puts, shorts and new longs - we move \~5% off the lows 

EVERYONE TAKES PROFITS ON SHORTS, WE GO UP

**Friday: Up 1%, Down 2%** 

* The wave of shorts covering and puts closing has subsided
* The wave of new cash on the sidelines is gone 
* Reality sets back in as the overall market, as opposed to the short term participants/market makers, continue with the overall downward trend
* All of the gains from Thursday are erased
* We stop close to where we started before the CPI report comes out 

&amp;#x200B;

**Bearish things to keep in mind going into next week:**

* Oil might continue to fall going into midterms, market maker (the US Gov), but it is [headed higher for longer](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xrtkjs/the_bull_case_for_oil/)  
* Dollar doesn't seem to be slowing down 
* 2YR and 10YR yields remain elevated and it looks like they will continue to rise 
* Bank of England is removing support 
* It is consensus that .75 will be the next hike, with a meaningful chance at a 1.00 hike 
* Inflation is not subsiding, there is more work to be done, employment remains high, Powell is committed to the job and is most likely going to overcommit 
* Mega caps, and [TSLA specifically](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/), are about to finally succumb to the selling pressure and capitulate. Anyone holding TSLA beware - its not going to ""fair value"" its going to overshoot to the downside 
* Housing and rent basically can't go down (sorry to all the housing crash enthusiasts) with supply constrained. No one wants to be building, no new housings coming on the market, existing owners (should) have 3% interest rates and can't/won't sell. Everyone has to rent or bid up assets further. A decade of under building precedes this market environment. There can't be ""demand destruction"" if there is a greater number of ""sellers destroyed"" by even greater market dynamics than rates 
* Russia running out of options. Even if peace/deal is reached globalization is over and the west hasn't quite realized that

&amp;#x200B;

**How to win:** 

Sell call spreads until we test the low, then sell put spreads why SPY is around 348-350 level. Don't buy puts until VIX is under 27/28 otherwise IV crush and theta can eliminate nearly all your gains (this is why your long options are net losers).",1

"Is QQQ guiding SPY?$SPDR¬Æ S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust going into today after yesterdays green day and after google/ amd popped off after hours... my question that i expect to get an answer to today is whether $Invesco QQQ Trust is forshadowing where SPY is going. 
let me explain...

so with the January dip we saw two highs on 1/4 and then 1/13. as we know Tech was the heaviest hit by that dip with QQQ being way over weight tech they obviously saw a much bigger correction around almost 20% from the high while spy only saw 10%... 

now lets look at last week and this week. whats driving the market? tech of course. so today we saw spy break and close above 365 which if you see on their daily chart means they broke their resistance line from 1/4 and 1/13 (white dotted). 
my forshadowing thought process is that SPYs equivalent resistance line from 1/4 and 1/13 is around 460. many if not everyone is citing how 460 is going to be a major barrier for SPY to break. but what if it actually isnt going to be? 
think about it... QQQ closed above and broke their resistance line. techs (google) gonna push this bullish tomorrow. 
SPY closed at 452.95 and bumped to 455 after hours... if SPY saw a 2% day tomorrow it puts it near 462... 2% bull day when google is up 10% after hours is not unrealistic at all. 
QQQ next resistance is 376 (daily 50/ 100 EMA). That would only take a 3% tomorrow to touch resistance there... which is not unrealistic. 
so the question is... right now is QQQ leading SPY and foreshadowing further upside for at least this week?

in my opinion yes. im watching for QQQ to break its 376 resistance. if we see a rejection SPY may see a rejection of 460 but i suspect this bullrun continues through end of week assuming meta and amazon continues the tech earning beats...

Because everyone knows the numbers are going to be lower. They had issues with both the German and Chinese factories, and there are supply chain problems.

"From 10k to loser to 50k challenge using SPY 0DTE option trading - Update 5I had previously mentioned I am going to continue posting this thread everyday. I missed few days. Here is my update. I had some losers and winners. Definitely the winners wining the trades. My account wasn't doing much going deep downtrend until started doing 0DTE options. My target was $100 a day. Recently I was able to make $300 to $500 every day consistently.  I use to get upset and down when my trade goes against. Also wait too much to cut down my loses. 

1. Nowadays learnt to trade without emotion (not completely , but improved). 
2. This helped me to quickly jump from losing trade to cut loss immediately, and catchup with trends. Now I learnt not to fight the market and let it drive my trading plan. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some of my wins. I am up $2k for Feb and $1k for March. Now everything is big both loss and wins. Win I lose, i immediately counter trade and exit with profit there by always maintaining profit for the day. I exceed 300% to 500% my daily $100 profit. 

I didn't trade on the missing days in the screenshot due to my work. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Does this methodology work ? Anyone else made consistent profits on 0DTE/1DTE contracts. I trade only SPY.

I am a little perplexed by today to be honest.. we opened 1.8% green and total today we only moved about $3.42 total which is 53% of the 10day average range of $6.4... We also failed to even hit the 30day volume average. Are bulls still exhausted? Is this a buying the rumor sell the news type of event? 

Tomorrow will be pretty interesting to watch. We obviously saw weakness earlier this week and end of last week. However, its clear that people are still buying but now that we got the CPI news what is the next bullish catalyst to push us up? 

https://preview.redd.it/wleu2e3s7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e98a84f02d12badfe6ca263c5dc0139569100f3

SPY has an impressive rising wedge forming on the daily (solid red lines). We rejected it perfectly today. I am surprised we did not break through this resistance today as this felt like an easy layup for the bulls to take spy to a 3% plus green day. 

Next major resistance I have is at 421.1 and then 423.7. 

One key takeaway I have from today is that we did back test the daily 200ema and we are holding that support very well. I do favor that as a bullish omen for the markets. 

We are seeing an impressive $3.97 gap on the daily though. We now have three pretty large daily gaps with two down near 370s and now this one in the 410s. 

https://preview.redd.it/dmmxq3qs7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a43305755af44e1c3c5f2c2ee2055dcd72f9e2ef

Spy weekly is looking pretty bullish though. We have held the weekly 9 week long bull channel support and now we are looking to test this weekly rising wedge. Resistance for the weekly to watch is 423 and key support is now 415. 

If we continue to trend like this I have little hesitation in saying that we touch the 430s next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/xmhj7dct7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1013900f7b2941c50e5caafcf0e0fac10b7c22d8

ES futures is in the same boat. Key resistance remains at 4223 for the rising wedge and then 4275 for the next rising wedge. 

Support is now at 4184 the daily 200ema followed by 4140. 

https://preview.redd.it/hkuao6yt7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4899599e98b6cb8605ca97329dd67c52d4f2f56

Futures weekly never did confirm the bull support however we are not trending over that weekly resistance level of 4163. A close over that and I do suspect that we see 4300s next week. 

Rising wedge resistance is 4232 and support is that 4163 level tomorrow. 

https://preview.redd.it/yoeyoeku7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebf8a53de06faaae4ad702c0cd8cb90ffae5cd57

Apples like that gold fish that no matter how neglected it is, how often you feed it, how often you don‚Äôt change the water, or how often the cat tries to eat it‚Ä¶ that mofo just don‚Äôt quit. 

Apple broke through the rising wedge (this is the one that spy/ es rejected today‚Ä¶ omen for tomorrow? Most likely) and closed over the support level of 168.9. 

From here apple is on a mission to test the bear market resistance level of 173-174.5 depending on how quickly we get there. We now have two MASSIVE gaps on the Apple daily. We have a $1.86 gap from July 29th and then todays $1.08 gap. When will we fill these gaps? This week? Next week? 2023? Who knows at this point‚Ä¶ Apple on a mission for green and I hesitate to bet against that. 

Key resistances- 171.8 -&gt; 172.8

Key support- 168.9 -&gt; 166.5 -&gt; 164.9

https://preview.redd.it/95lc5i6v7yg91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=902b4257d02803cdaf1ad71b9039f734c801f333

The VIX has just continued to go lower and lower and lower. I am a little impressed that it bounced directly off my falling wedge support line though and that it didn‚Äôt dump into the 18s today. However, the VIX is on an almost 9 week long unwind. 

Interestingly enough the bounce today is at the median high level that the VIX spent most of its time at in 2021. The low end is closer to 15.5. If we continue to see the VIX unwind we are going to be looking at a new possible range of 15.5 to 19.75. 

Historically I would say most of 2022 has been spent between 18.6 and 25.5 or 25.5 and 34.7. I would even venture to say that most of 2022 has been spent well over 25.5‚Ä¶. Is there a reversion to mean expected here? Do we short term revert or do we long term revert? 

10% challenge-

Overall today and really this week has been a great week for me. I was swinging that Apple put that I averaged down yesterday. I did attempt to close it EOD yesterday but it didn‚Äôt fill missed it by about 10 cents‚Ä¶ I was already down over 50% at EOD yesterday. I was able to closer it at open before the IV crush for -84.3%. Overall im still at 1.5x weekly profits with that loss. 

I am continuing to capitalize on quick scalps using the 1min/ 5min HA candles with STOCH and VOLD/VOLSPD 1min HA candles. The 20/50emas here have been gold for me. 

https://preview.redd.it/r4rprh1w7yg91.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc5d4a6ac354ff3ab23eb5e50de0ddae975a9e8f

Aim small miss small. I am currently 9 for 9 on plays this week and my only red play is that swing play that I opened last week. Overall its been a great week. 

Today was a tough one to trade because we had such extreme bull momentum, however, the candles were moving at snail pace all day. Going to be interesting to see what tomorrow brings. 

On one hand this feels like the bulls are exhausted and gives me May FOMC vibes where she dumped like a mofo the next day and on the other hand this felt like a premarket run followed by consolidation all day. EOD I saw some crazy buying coming in on VOLSPD and VOLD. Very organized and consistent buying, however, SPY barely budged and even sold off at the end‚Ä¶ I wonder if we just saw a ton of shorts cover EOD. 

Remember in this market guys we don‚Äôt need to go for homeruns. We don‚Äôt need to play every single candle. A 10% win that you let turn into a -20% loser is actually a 30% loser‚Ä¶ Be smart out here.

"11-15-22 SPY/ ES Futures, and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisGoing to shy away from further TA on Apple. For me personally I don‚Äôt focus on it much anymore and I just don‚Äôt want to waste my resources on it when I have had a much higher success rate with Tesla and of course my GOAT SPY. 

Today we saw yet again another massive sell off. I am trying to decide if markets are truly that over extended that anything will cause a dump or if we are just getting truly rogue new waves causing a dump. The one thing i will say is that as low as the VIX is right now‚Ä¶ it sure shows signs it doesn‚Äôt want to stay there. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dfq05cbxt70a1.png?width=945&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bceb8d88dc64a122111ae099429909bfb085c4f

The one thing that did happen today that is important to note even before that huge dump with the Poland ‚Äúincident‚Äù is that SPY had a massive pre market attempted to break out over the daily 200ema at open and then from there was stuck in a tight range and even before the Poland news broke it appeared we were looking at a bigger sell off EOD. 

Now SPY is faced with a nice daily 200ema attempt and rejection with a doji candle. So the question will be which should be answered tomorrow is‚Ä¶ did we just put the top in with that 200ema rejection or did we just reject to gather further support before we push through this major resistance point? I still remain indifferent here as I did note that the VIX was pushing up this morning even before the Poland news drop. So it could be that at these levels people are finally starting to put some downside protection back on. However, I do still think its too early to go long on puts here but I also think its silly to be long on calls here also.

Looking at futures daily compared to SPY daily there is quite a bit of a difference in the daily candle structure. On Futes we actually see a really large wicked double top at 4002 gravestone doji. This to me is set up as a far more bearish indication then SPY daily shows. 

Futures has struggled now 3 days in a row to break through 4002 and most importantly to close over it. This is our key pivot level. If futures can close over 4002 then I do forsee a case for 4100. However, IF we reject or fail to retest 4002 again then I am looking for support down 3900. The key support level is 3965.

Tesla had started out bullish in my opinion breaking through that falling wedge resistance and breaking over and holding over the daily 8ema for a while. I was actually bullish on Tesla thinking with this breakout we could see a run for the daily 20ema and possibly channel resistance at 208.8. However, we ended up loosing support and closing back under the daily 8ema. With the daily 8ema closed under I am seeing a very strong resistance at 196.1. Until this level is broken and the daily 8ema is closed over I do expect further downside or at minimum consolidation. 

Support- 190.8 -&gt; 185.7 -&gt; 177.4

We did see a pretty nice breakout of this bear channel today on the VIX. The thing I noted and mentioned earlier is that we saw the VIX was holding 23.5 and was actually pushing up even before the Poland new hit the markets. With the VIX options expiration tomorrow its very possible that is why we saw this movement up. Or as I had mentioned with spy at 400/ spx at 4000 range now I do wonder if we are seeing people put their downside hedges back on. I mean it doesn‚Äôt take a brainiac to realize we are STILL in a bear market and things STILL aren‚Äôt that great in the economy and realistically no one knows exactly what JPOW is going to do next month at FOMC.

Good day today. I was busy with my daughter and her birthday most of the morning so I wasn‚Äôt around to trade until about 1230‚Ä¶ hit that morning put scalp on SPX before I left. I came back in right before that massive dump from the Poland news and got burnt on some calls off what looked like a support bounce. After that did a few quick level to level plays but on huge reactions like that I don‚Äôt enjoy trading much and I also don‚Äôt trade during power hour much anymore besides the occasional too good to be true lotto play. So I was mostly cash. Still a green day but small at that‚Ä¶

I am very curious to see what the market is going to open at tomorrow. I heard there COULD be an emergency meeting with NATO to discuss more Russia stuff. I don‚Äôt know if there will be any further action as the narrative im seeing pushed right now is that it was an accident OR it wasn‚Äôt even a missile‚Ä¶ we probably will never know the truth. 

I did swing some Tesla OTM puts though based on that setup on the daily. I will take profits or take my loss at open pretty much regardless unless im seeing something different on my indicators/ the charts. 

That‚Äôs the hardest part about swings is that I get a lot of questions before the market even opens of ‚Äúare you going to take profits at open?‚Äù ‚Äúyou going to take your loss at open?‚Äù and honestly until the market opens and until I see exactly what VOLD is doing and the overall moneyflow/ momentum and the DMI stoch and just the actual movement of the candles I have no way to know exactly what the plan is. The only time I for sure can say yes I will close at open is when I know I have a substantial amount of profits OR the move I anticipated clearly isn‚Äôt about to play out.

"Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) both reported weaker than expected earnings for Q2. Jim Cramer says """"I think Google and Microsoft will be good tomorrow"" Alphabet reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue for the second quarter.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

**Earnings per share (EPS): $1.21 vs $1.28 expected, according to Refinitiv**

**Revenue: $69.69 billion vs $69.9 billion expected, according to Refinitiv**

**YouTube advertising revenue: $7.34 billion vs. $7.52 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

**Google Cloud revenue: $6.28 billion vs. $6.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount.**

**Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $12.21 billion vs $12.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

Revenue growth slowed to 13% in the quarter from 62% a year earlier, when the company was benefiting from the post-pandemic reopening and consumer spending was on the rise.

Currency fluctuations from a strengthening dollar knocked 3.7 percentage points off revenue growth, CFO Ruth Porat told CNBC‚Äôs Deirdre Bosa. Porat said the strength of the dollar will hit next quarter‚Äôs results even harder.

Porat also characterized the current outlook as one of ‚Äúuncertainty in the global economic environment.‚Äù

Advertising revenue increased just 12% to $56.3 billion, as marketers reeled in their spending to manage inflationary pressures. The most notable deceleration was in the YouTube division, where sales rose 5% after jumping 84% in the same period a year ago.

Microsoft shares rose 5% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software maker issued a rosy income forecast for the year ahead, despite issuing quarterly results that failed to reach Wall Street consensus.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

**Earnings: $2.23 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.**

**Revenue: $51.87 billion, vs. $52.44 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.**

Microsoft turned in the slowest revenue growth since 2020, at 12% year over year in the quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. The company‚Äôs earnings per share fell short of consensus for the first time since 2016, with net income rising 2% to $16.74 billion.

With respect to guidance, Microsoft called for $49.25 billion to $50.25 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue. The middle of the range, at $49.75 billion, implies about 10% revenue growth, reflecting worsening PC sales and slower cloud infrastructure growth. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected more, at $51.49 billion. The company‚Äôs implied gross margin, at 69.85%, was wider than the 69.30% consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount.

And for the new 2023 fiscal year, the company reiterated its forecast from three months ago, despite the economic climate.

"$AAPL is the main reason we didn't see a lower leg down today with $SPYFirst of all, I hope everyone had a good day today.

Now this won't be that technical, because I am not a smart man. I wouldn't be here if I was. But this morning as I was watching $SPY and looking at my puts go up in price at open I was happy for about 5 minutes and then watched as they flipped and went back down. I was watching my list and trying to figure out why is this happening. Probably like most people here, or at least the other people who are highly regarded like me.

Well I found it, partly from other people smarter then me pointing it out. But I did a little work hitting print screen and making some pictures everyone can look at.

[So this was $SPY today.](https://preview.redd.it/j15efj8mygb91.jpg?width=2934&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e57b33aba4c6841f4a17a4fd8068cf32dcc0d8c4)

Now for the smart people here they know that $SPY is a bunch of different stocks bundle up into one stock people can trade. So if all the stocks in that ETF are doing bad then the ETF will go down. This will also cause it to go up if they are all doing good. Pretty simple right? Well it's not that simple, but it will work for what I am trying to get across.

So $SPY is an ETF and is made up of a bunch of stocks and those stocks are bunched up into sectors and they are weighted by how much $SPY has invested in each one. The biggest/heaviest one is for technology and you can look it up under $XLK.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here I did it for you, this is today.](https://preview.redd.it/kzt8so430hb91.jpg?width=2962&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff161fdb9f1abdcc7c6dc1b587cef170e4ef43bc)

If you wanna check out the full list you can see it here.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/)

If you don't check it out I will break it down real fast for you.

Tech 24.17%

Healthcare 15.17%

Financial Services 12.92%

Consumer Cyclical 10.28%

Communication Services 8.84%

There is other stuff but I am lazy, just click the link and check for yourself.

So back to $XLK and why it's important. In this group of stocks are a few everyone here knows. But the one I wanna talk about is $AAPL which is 5.90% of the total assets $SPY has invested. That not just under the tech umbrella, that is everything. It might not seem like a big deal when you see $MSFT is 5.60% of $SPY's assets. But trust me that .30% is a big deal. Here take a look at this chart.

&amp;#x200B;

[Does this look pretty familiar to you?](https://preview.redd.it/ub1ux4qe2hb91.jpg?width=2984&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d1a805de3adf6be9b17a31ff57be4e4cd10d977)

Did you just do a double take? I know I did this afternoon when I was looking at it. This is $AAPL holding up $XLK which is helping hold up $SPY. Another thing to check out is this.

&amp;#x200B;

[I hate $AAPL.](https://preview.redd.it/0z8a1nd43hb91.jpg?width=695&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51e082b16b211bcae41a77fc1399cbd3b9870e84)

"SPY 3/4/22 Daily Analysis and RecapGoing into this mornings pre-market I mentioned that we really did not have enough information available to get a great grasp on where we were headed long term. Despite today very much so being a sideways range day I think we do have a little idea of where we are headed now.

I mentioned a key support Bulls couldn‚Äôt lose was 427.8 this morning during pre-market and that support held very strong this morning.

Bears really needed to keep SPY below the Daily 8 EMA of 434.8 to stay in bear territory.

Todays Range was 433.4 to 427.8 with a finish at 432.17 for -0.8%.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q9bsh6a6vfl81.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f5fc090893e06c849fea4f4585a99cd2530285f

A couple major notes for this 15 minute chart I presented this morning. Around 1pm we managed to poke through that downward resistance like to negate the channel completely. However, we failed to break through 433.4 and the very important resistance that I mentioned would be a big battle at 433.8.

Yesterdays after hours had us at a low of 427.8 which we managed to retest and hold as support today.

We now have two very clear lines in the sand of bull territory vs. bear territory.

Going into after hours tonight and Futures on Sunday‚Ä¶ SPY needs to break and hold 433.8 in order to see upward bull momentum and SPY needs to break and hold below 427.8 in order to see a continued bearish sell off.

Overall there is not really enough information until one of those two key levels breaks and holds to go long (hold over night) on any positions right now.

If you take a look at the futures chart it does give in my opinion a slightly better picture of the overall trend that has been taking place since Yesterday morning. Overall it is making consistently for two days now lower highs and lower lows which is a bearish movements.

For those who watch futures

Support- 4304.7 ÔÉ† 4293.5 ÔÉ† 4283 (last support before major sell off)

Resistance- 4327.5 ÔÉ† 4338.5 (last resistance before breakout)

Now arguably my favorite chart to look at daily at night time to help piece together a better sense of direction.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/egazjko4vfl81.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af3bf883b2b1780db94bf8808ac1abfa2b309901

I mentioned last night that I believed the 8 ema (which was support) and the 200 ema (which was resistance) was going to be our guidance of where this market was going to head next week depending on where todays candle finished.

While there is a very miniscule gap I can see on the daily chart from 433.3 to 433.9 I do not think this is one that will need to be filled as on the actual 15 minute and other timeframe chart we do not see this gap.

We now have a candled fully closed below the 8 ema and 200 ema again which Monday will confirm but to me shows favor to a bearish week ahead next. However, if bulls can get this candle Monday back above the 8 ema and 200 ema we may see the upwards momentum continue.

In addition for more bearish indication it is noted the 20 ema is now completely below the 200 ema and continuing to dip further below. The daily candle (which im sure someone else will inform me its something different) is more or less a doji candle too which can be a reversal indicator but in simplest of terms is just a indecision candle.

Key levels to watch.

Support- 427.1 (the low from March 1st) ÔÉ† 421.4 ( the low from Feb 23 and the mid point of the grey channel)

Resistance- 434.3 (8 ema) 437 (resistance line from the high of feb 10th and Mar 3rd) ÔÉ† 438.34 (20 ema) ÔÉ† 439.23 (200 ema) ÔÉ† 445 (upper resistance of the channel)

Since I will not be posted a pre-market on Monday here are the levels

0.5%= 434.3

1= 436.5

1.5%= 438.7

2%= 440.8

* It‚Äôs volatile enough to scalp calls but if you're a greenhorn then it‚Äôs best to follow the larger downtrend and short the bounces. I scalped calls on Friday and should‚Äôve taken profit and ended up losing a small amount ü§°. It happens to the best of us.
* Key levels to watch in the AM on Monday: 419.59 - 422.00 - 424.12 (puts below and calls above).

"$TSLA, $AAPL, and $AMZN have yet to revisit their bear market lows, while the S&amp;P 500 and QQQ already have. Will these stocks follow the rest of the market?Fundamentals aside, what do $TSLA, $AAPL, and $AMZN stocks have in common? 

Three things:

1. **They have yet to revisit their bear market lows** (they‚Äôre stronger than most of the market).
2. **They put in the first inkling of bullish market structure** (they experienced significant bounces and are trying for a higher low)
3. **Their social activity is growing substantially** (people are showing interest in these stocks. They‚Äôre talking about them across social and news &amp; posts about them are trending)

Let's look at these 3 things in chart format:

**Tesla $TSLA:**

[$TSLA Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/qa3ufmmv8op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=365e7f85b98c892e7b3f7006c7a4454d45f50977)

&amp;#x200B;

**Apple $AAPL:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Amazon $AMZN:**

[$AMZN Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/6xuy4lc89op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c042709e68a346a119200ae6a487f50abb62a1)

As you can see, these stocks have noticeably increased social activity that appears to be trending up in the last 2-3 months.

Now, what about stocks that have already revisited their bear market lows? Let‚Äôs take a look at a couple of popular stock picks that have performed poorly price-wise and spot the differences:

**NVIDIA $NVDA:**

[$NVDA Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/l8dhcjzg9op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e30185a23cb56a6e87bb09bd5d9675f45c6d52)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Adobe $ADBE:**

[$ADBE Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/ahfsazxi9op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b5e6446f2d5ea7aef2dd8def6348a41575a406b)

While $NVDA and $ADBE experienced recent spikes in social activity, they do not show the same kind of sustained growth in activity (continuous interest from people) as many of the better-performing stocks. 

Therefore, in times like these when the macro environment and markets are bearish, it‚Äôs probably best to keep your eye on stocks with sustainable increases in social activity, rather than the stocks with little growth or growth that fades quickly. 

So, will $TSLA, $AMZN, and $AAPL hold above their bear market lows? Or follow the rest of the market? 

While the social data presented in these charts don't provide the answers, they do provide a different perspective that's interesting to think about.  

How do you interpret this information? Do you find it interesting and useful?",1

"Bear Market Rally: SPY 340 EOYWe got TGT, WMT, HD on Tuesday premarket. There is no way these guys don't issue a profit warning for the holiday quarter after AMZN cut guidance for Q4. 

AMZN CEO:  ""We are seeing signs all around that, again, people's budgets are tight, inflation is still high, energy costs are an additional layer on top of that caused by other issues,"" he said. ""**We are preparing for what could be a slower growth period, like most companies**."" 

THAT WAS 2 WEEKS AGO, TGT is up 16% since then. 

Amazon forecast net sales of between $140 billion and $148 billion, or growth as little as 2% from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $155.2 billion. 

Then on 11/10 in the midst of the rally everyone missed this nugget from Fed Daly

**""We will probably need to tighten more than the Sept. Fed forecasts suggested""**

[**https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20220921.htm**](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20220921.htm)

Median was calling for 4.6% fed funds rate by 2023, that's probably going to be raised to 5% or higher at the December FOMC.

Last bear market rally peaked 8/15 at $430. By 9/30 the market was at $355, a 17% drop. 

$400 Nov. 14 to $340 by Dec. 30 would be a 15% drop in the exact same timeframe. 

Retail is getting set up to get dumped on once again with an ""inflation peaked"" narrative. 

Inflation may be coming down but the recession is just beginning, good luck regards. 

 

""We are not convinced this is the beginning of a new bull market,"" said Sam        Stovall, chief investment strategist at CRFA Research.        ""We believe that we are headed for recession. That has not been factored        into earnings estimates and, therefore, share prices.""     

Stovall also said the stock market has yet to see the ""traditional        shakeout of confidence capitulation that we typically see that marks the        end of the bear markets.",0

# If this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.

This is a pretty big kick in the pants. RayTracing is the ""big"" thing their stock is surging on, but 60 FPS @ 1080P? 

AND this is completely dependent on leveraging Nvidia's 3-step rendering process to hit these performance targets, which includes their traditional rendering pipeline, their AI-guided anti-aliasing, AND their RTX implementation. Any ""pure"" RayTracing implementation (via DX12 or Vulkan) that doesn't have all of Nvidia's implementation components is going to suffer.

"3/30/22 SPY premarket... can the bears do it?3/30/22 Spy Pre-market

As I had mentioned in my daily TA last night I fully expected a gap down over night based on the setup we had left yesterday and here we are currently sitting around -0.45% premarket. 

Immediate open and gap down saw a slight recovery before we just most recently made the premarket low of 459.2. SPY is currently trying to recover but its not looking very good for it. 

https://preview.redd.it/zjccoyhsoiq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ef7e483ca2fe911b53519cb32425322b23913c3

Once again all eyes will be on the VIX which saw a nice gap up at open and is currently sitting at 19.67 which is just off its high of 19.8 so far today. The Last time VIX was 19.8 Spy was sitting at 457.5 range. IF the continues to hold this range at open or push any higher close to 20 today. I will fully expect to see this gap down to 455.91 filled today. 

Apple also along with most text looking weak this morning will make for an interesting day. As hard as it is to want to get in with the bears and to believe we can have a true red day we have to be open to the possibility. Those of us playing PUTS today I encourage you to watch the VIX‚Ä¶ if the VIX is not solidly trending up for a good period of time you are going ot get burnt.

"8-3-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily TAToday we saw yet again a case of extreme bull momentum. The bulls were out in full force today or should I say‚Ä¶ the bears didn‚Äôt wanna sell today. 

This is now the 5th day in a row where we have opened ran up‚Ä¶ dumped (and a very convincing dump may I add) only for us to then run even harder EOD. 

The craziest thing of the whole day is Apple‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/ifthv1ij8kf91.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6cf6e847ff50c2468be530ad00eb8e4a64f96d9d

Apple had an implied move of $2.01 with a improbable high of 162.84‚Ä¶ for those of you who don‚Äôt know IV prices in movement everyday and overall it provides probable and improbable ranges‚Ä¶ generally speaking even touching the improbable high is RARE let alone going over it‚Ä¶

So today we saw apple have a total DTR (daily true range) of 5.84 which is 290% of the implied IV move. It was also 144% of the average 10day range and 134% of the 30day average range. It reached nearly $4 over its improbable high of day. This is one of the most imbalanced and ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù moves I have ever seen on apple. 

https://preview.redd.it/vy6xbs3k8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9992b6c6a9028c8553f9205388de4e07d540a8b7

This was the greenest close apple has had since May 27th. As you can see looking very interesting on the daily‚Ä¶ 

We have officially broke out of the red rising wedge. We are now working on another black dotted rising wedge. This one uses early June dates for the resistance line. Today Apple perfectly hit that. It uses the last 7 trading days support for the support line. 

This pattern gives a high of 167.6 and a low of 162.9. We still have that gap down below also on Apple but we are obviously getting further and further away form that gap. 

https://preview.redd.it/tus6p2pk8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=200c1bda0bb87c211cf2e9ecec02b9dc8d81e5e5

Apple weekly chart broke its resistance line today too for the overall down trend and now all that is left is the resistance of the overall market which uses January 3rd and March 28th weekly highs as resistance. That gives us a possible upside of 174.5 next week. 

Overall if this extreme bullish momentum keeps up there is a case to be made for apple 175 next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/euqavk8l8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a06be3d1bd7d4916f02809ca8329af7ad4a5d18

Overall SPY and Futures are putting in some crazy looking rising wedges‚Ä¶ some of the tallest and most extreme rising wedges I have seen in a while on the daily. 

Currently you can see on SPY we have the purple dotted resistance line which we rejected perfectly today. It uses the July 29th and June 28th daily candles for resistance. Resistance for tomorrow will be at 416.7

The black dotted resistance line uses July 29th, July 8th, July 7th and June 29th for resistance. This give sus a resistance of 418.8 tomorrow. 

And then we have the red dotted resistance line from June 28th, June 15th and June 13th which gives us resistance of 423.5 for tomorrow. 

We have three potential rising wedges on the daily right now which is the most I have ever seen and they all give us potential to reject a resistance tomorrow. 

The black dotted support line using August 3rd, Aug 2nd, July 27th and July 26th we have 413.8 as support tomorrow. 

We broke the possible down trend resistance today too. 

We are also about to hit the 417.4 level support which is also the daily 200ema. 

Overall despite pretty much every sign pointing to a sell off today AND that morning dump looking hella convincing the bears continue to be in control. There is no reason to short this until we break the 100ema. But I still hesitate to go long until we see the daily 200ema confirmed broken.

If we break that 200ema there is a decent chance we reach out for 430 next week. A good CPI could fuel an even higher bull run too. 

https://preview.redd.it/lv324lxl8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=863757c0e7963f322dc6c7a70d5bb2ceb9001593

Futures major resistances are the blacked dotted rising wedge at 4178, red dotted resistance at 4202 and the blue bull channel at 4241.

The 4178 level is both the daily 200ema and it is the resistance from June highs. 

The biggest supports to watch for ES is 4117 and 4079 tomorrow. 

https://preview.redd.it/z44f7ggm8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2020a20b334ba1b0e2d880768f85da8ff568465a

Spy on the weekly timeframe did attempt to break into the next weekly level at 415 today, however, end of day it lost that level. This has been a level that has been struggled to be breached and closed over since April. This will be a key level to watch the bulls and bears fight over. 

https://preview.redd.it/rl0qkm1n8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9034aa07d93719cc3fcf8925c7ae0e20c227d37

Futures also rejecting this level of 4160 too. This level for futures too has been pretty major resistance since April. 

The bears will need to defend these 415/ 4160 level aggressively tomorrow if they have any hopes for the EOW and next week. Overall this is setting up for a break out to that 430/ 4360 levels unless we see a major sell off tomorrow and Friday. 

https://preview.redd.it/8a504xon8kf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54e7bd56d1dd6b2d9ca4aa2b693920e9e8ca191e

The VIX had the biggest red close since June 15th‚Ä¶ the day of FOMC. I still struggle to short this until we see the VIX do something other than drop every single day. 

10% challenge-

Today was a GREAT day I turned into an L by not following my own rules of course. 

https://preview.redd.it/3ytsqzdo8kf91.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11c84e9c9985f21267473f7381aaf4205a4fbb85

I played that morning drop pretty nicely. Got out for a 21.1% gain (of course it pretty much went straight to 100% right after‚Ä¶ ) but got caught at what looked like a clear support break and close under 8ema only to get burnt. I didn‚Äôt manage my risk well enough and from there it was pretty much over. And then they faked me out with the head and shoulders on the 15min and break of momentum only to rip it even higher. 

Todays lesson‚Ä¶ stick to your rules AND never ever fight momentum. The momentum today especially on the volumes was some of the stupidest extreme bull momentum ive seen yet. 

Tomorrows a new day and a new chance. 

I am carrying some 9dte Apple 152.5 puts overnight that I do suspect by next week to at minimum break even. If we ever lose this bull momentum and we drop to gap fill as I suspect Apple needs to then they will be sitting pretty good.",0

[Tesla adjusts Autopilot to comply with new EU regulations | May 17 2019](https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/17/tesla-updates-autopilot-europe/)

Tesla will push an updated Autopilot in Europe that scales back on a couple of functions in order to comply with new regulations. The changes will require faster lane changes and limit how far you can turn the steering wheel on Autosteer. Electrek reports that while Tesla's Autopilot was approved under older rules, it had to be dialed back in order to comply with the new UN/ECE R79 regulation on driver assistance systems. The update only impacts Model S and Model X vehicles; Model 3 already complies with the new rules.

Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk is turning to the insurance business in an attempt to achieve what the automaker has so far struggled with on the vehicle pricing front: lower costs for customers. Tesla says it will start offering insurance this month that taps internal data from the AutoPilot driver-assist system to reduce rates.

[More Advanced Safety for Tesla Owners | May 2, 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/more-advanced-safety-tesla-owners)

The massive amount of real-world data gathered from our cars‚Äô eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar, coupled with billions of miles of inputs from real drivers, helps us better understand the patterns to watch out for in the moments before a crash. As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That‚Äôs because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we‚Äôre introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features ‚Äì Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance ‚Äì help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.

The chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a ‚Äúhalf-trillion dollar market cap company,‚Äù said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn‚Äôt open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.

[Tesla delays electric semi truck production to next year | Apr 25th 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/04/25/tesla-semi-delay-electric-truck-production-next-year/)

During its first quarter 2019 earnings call last night, Tesla confirmed that it is delaying the production of Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck program, to next year. The executive also said that they are currently testing the electric trucks with maximum loads and that they are making improvements to the design. Musk previously said that Tesla aims to manufacture 100,000 electric trucks per year. Over the past two years, Tesla has been taking reservations for the electric truck and said that the production versions will have 300-mile and 500-mile range versions for $150,000 and $180,000 respectively.

[The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther | April 23 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther)

Beginning today, Model S and Model X now come with an all-new drivetrain design that increases each vehicle‚Äôs range substantially, achieving a landmark 370 miles and 325 miles on the EPA cycle for Model S and Model X Long Range, respectively. Using the same 100 kWh battery pack, these design and architecture updates will allow drivers to travel farther than ever before, charging less frequently and getting more range out of every dollar spent on charging. We‚Äôre also introducing a brand-new adaptive suspension system for Model S and Model X, along with a few other improvements for the best range, acceleration, and ride comfort ever, plus a Ludicrous Mode upgrade for our most loyal customers.

Tesla vehicles will likely be better at driving than humans by the end of 2019, CEO Elon Musk said in an interview with MIT research scientist Lex Fridman. ""I think it will become very quickly ‚Äî maybe even towards the end of this year, but I would say I'd be shocked if it's not next year, at the latest ‚Äî that having a human intervene will decrease safety,"" Musk said. Musk later said that Tesla's autonomous-driving technology was improving at an exponential rate, and that it seemed to him that the company is ahead of its competitors in the autonomous-driving industry.

Of course, we need some context here to explain what Musk is referring to, so here's the tweets:@RamLover69 You would still be physically fatigued if you tried to haul 12,000 lbs of steel beams like I do every day with my Dodge Ram, 2019s motor trend truck of the year.@elonmusk 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children‚Äôs toys?It's not a secret that Tesla is working on an electric pickup truck. In fact, it's scheduled to be revealed sometime later this year. As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with ""crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard,"" noted Musk in a previous tweet. We suspect that whatever a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150 can do, Tesla will one-up those figures.

The specs weren‚Äôt much of a surprise either: the long-range Model Y has a range of 300 miles and seating for seven. A performance version of the vehicle is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. ‚ÄúIt has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,‚Äù Musk said. ‚ÄúSo this thing will be really tight on corners.‚Äù The $47,000 long-range Model Y will come first in the fall of 2020, and it will have a range of 300 miles, Musk said.

The cheaper, standard range version with a range of 230 miles won‚Äôt be available until 2021, Musk said. It will sell for $39,000.

[Introducing V3 Supercharging | March 6 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)

Tesla has more than 12,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia and our network continues to grow daily: more than 99% of the U.S. population is covered by the network, and we anticipate similar coverage in Europe by the end of 2019. Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we‚Äôre announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.

[Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 was the best-selling EV in the world last year | Feb 22 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236707/tesla-model-3-2018-best-selling-ev-global)

The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.

[Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)

According to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017‚Äî and that doesn‚Äôt even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it‚Äôs left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a ‚ÄúStandby‚Äù state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car‚Äôs external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an ‚ÄúAlert‚Äù state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an ‚ÄúAlarm‚Äù state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car‚Äôs audio system. If a car switches to ‚ÄúAlarm‚Äù state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They‚Äôll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.

"3/24/22 SPY Daily TA3-24-22 SPY Daily TA

Today was yet another aggravatingly low volume day coming in at a whopping 65million setting one the lowest volume day of the year and coming in under yesterdays 79million. I saw quite a few candles that were under 1 mil volume today which is very rare for spy. 

But nonetheless despite a very what I would call contradictory opening that required a lot of patience we did finally around 11am get the push we were looking for to finally step into a bull run. We rejected hard off the 449 resistance level falling all the way back down near 447 before finally during power hour after having 4 rejections at 448.8 we broke through and pushed it all the way up to 450.49 to close out the day up a cool 1.5%. Today we saw some of the lowest volume I have seen in a long time but we also saw some of the highest buy volume I have seen in months. It was very interesting to say the least because with the type of buy pressure we saw on SPY today we should have seen some very large and violent moves up but we did not see that. 

The VIX was the true winner today opening at 23.61 and falling all the way to a low of 21.49 before closing around 21.68 for an impressive 8% day! Despite the movement of the VIX today we did not see SPY react how many I would anticpate it to with such an unraveling of the VIX. But with the vix now sub 22 we are getting closer to the average around 19 and are not so over extended like we were previously.  

https://preview.redd.it/92321ddg6fp81.png?width=808&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=497f89eeeacc8e7c33d92ed27a114696aeb7c213

IF spy can manage to break through the 450.5 double top on the daily the current upward channel its trading within gives it room to break all the way up near 456 to 458. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, as you can see we are in an ascending wedge currently which if we were to break down out of it could put us down near 447 again to test the support of this channel. 

We will need to see how we open tomorrow to see if they want a bullish or bearish break.

The way this daily chart closed to today with that FAT double top at 450.5 along with a hanging man candle we very well could see a dip back below the 100 EMA of 445 tomorrow. 

https://preview.redd.it/n9w3pjsi6fp81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e272c871743f80b4135b82337ae16bcee01580c

The bears need a gap down over night and a red opening in order to push this lower tomorrow. 

The bulls need to see this open green above 450.5 to avoid a triple top inter day. The one thing that the bulls do have going for them is that they managed to get this candle to close back ABOVE the daily 100 ema which is a bullish trend. But what I am seeing set up currently is a similar trend we had back in February where we did a massive run up. Broke down. Broke back up for a double top at 458 and then crashed even lower. Granted this time is only over a 3 day period its very possible with only one red candle in 8 days (granted one was technically a -0.03% day). That is a whole lot of green in a very short period of time. I believe apple currently is at its eighth green day. 

If bulls can get this to open green tomorrow we may see a run towards the resistance lines at 458 where we will see if SPY will triple top or break through cleanly. 

https://preview.redd.it/5t211ojk6fp81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bd2dcb6781b99d46f88b2097ffe0550d40536a9

The weekly candle going into tomorrow is very similar as if we manage to gap up to 458 and hold there at close for the week we will actually see a perfect triple top at 458 (January 31 and February 7th week).

If the bulls manage to get a green day tomorrow to finish the week they truly need to close ABOVE 458 to keep the bull run energy going. Bears need to see a close tomorrow below 445.5 (daily 100 ema and weekly 20 ema) to bring some bearish momentum into next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

10% challenge-

I despite having to hold my calls through quite a bit of red at the end of the day managed to make 5 trades today and all 5 were green with anywhere from 10-20% profits. I did have one over night put lotto that closed down 15%. Overall not a bad day at all. Looking for one more strong day tomorrow.

"$TSLA $4,200C 11/4/2020Alright bois, I have some fresh DD. I was out test driving a Tesla Model 3 the other day (my wife's boyfriend said I couldn't buy an S, I hate that guy) and the salesman told me the ""Navigate on Autopilot"" feature is actually a full blown level 5 self driving feature. Unfortunately, it is capped at level 2 right now because *the man* is keeping them down, but he assured me there is nothing stopping them from releasing it after they get the okay from Washington.

If you're anything like me, you realized this is amazing DD! Tesla would never lie about performance or over-hype themselves, and this salesman seemed pretty on the ball! The only real question is what to do with this DD.

As I'm sure you all know, #YangGang is taking over in 2020. I honestly don't even know why they're bothering to have an election. A $1,000 Freedom Dividend annually so we can cut loose and let the robots take over is such a good ideal it literally can't go tits up. Once Yang is in office, it shouldn't take him more than a day to get the Freedom Dividend out to people and change all those pesky laws keeping tech companies down. Tesla does over the air updates, so it won't take long at all until everyone driving a Tesla has a sweet robo-chauffeur to do their bidding. 

Once all Teslas are fully self driving, everyone will want to buy shares of the company. Plus, everyone will have their $1,000 in Freedom Dividends to push the stock straight moonbound!

The only problem I can find is there are no $TSLA $4,200C 11/4/2020s for sale. The MMs want to hoard all the tendies for themselves! The closest I can find is $690C 1/15/2021. I want to make sure I get the $4,200Cs so I can make more money when it moons (4,200&gt;660). 

So, should I reach out to Robinhood support or go straight to the banks like in The Big Short?

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&gt;Another day of big reversals on Wall Street, with stocks posting their best week since June after a treasury rout stalled. The yen rose after reports that Japan may have intervened once more to support the currency.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
It's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.

Bulls closed well above the 20 MA. The 20 MA currently sits at 366.00. It‚Äôs important for bulls to follow through. If we can trade out of this smaller rectangle -highlighted in blue, I believe that we will see 380 and then decide from there. It‚Äôs do or die here IMO as GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, META, and AMZN report next week. Beats and FED talk about pivoting could give us the Nov. midterm rally to 390 - 400+.

"SPY - Emotional rollercoasterI don't usually trade options, but all the shit that happened over this past weekend made me think there is no way SPY not gonna drop. Placed my order first thing on Monday morning, saw my book value slowly go up over the day, I couldn't even focus at work. I took like a 2hrs coffee break and 4hrs lunch, and all I did was keep clicking refresh to see how much I made. I was up thousands at the end of the day and though to myself, no way Trump would keep quiet about China lowering their currency and I should hold over night. And I was right, around 8pm Monday SPY was 277, I was up almost 10k. I couldn't even sleep that night. I know 10k is not a lot of money to most of you guys, but I have never made so much from 2 days of trading. At that moment, I believe I could do anything, I serious consider taking the rest of week off and go on a small vacation. Then came premarket, SPY open at 283, I thought the trading system was buggy and forgot the after hour trading value. Came 930am when it actually open, mother fucker, it open at 285. I only made thousands instead of 10k, and I believed SPY would go lower so I held onto the options. Then I see my thousands turn into hundreds over the day, and turn into nothing at the end of day. I didn't lost money, but I felt like shit. I kept thinking ""if I sold the day before or that morning I could have made thousands"", ""I shouldn't be greedy"", and ""if my options go back into money I will sell right away"". Came this morning, I see SPY dropped and my confidence was back....until 1030. I couldn't handle this kinda emotional rollercoaster, I sold everything at noon for a small small small profit.

I am apparently the only buyer today as the 15 volume so far were mine. optionsprofitcalculator cant even calculate the calls right now for some reason idk. The return on it is astronomical, true moon shot boys, just need to rally next week for the easiest 10x Ive seen.

Let me know if Im horribly mistaken and just threw 500$ into a blender. 

Edit:
To all the re-used Robinhood hate...why pay for commission on options? I have an E*TRADE account too but $7.70 every move is wasted. 

Just use finviz for fundamental and technical analysis, and Robinhood as the broker. Why spend the extra money?

Edit 2: 
So I use my own calculator that I made in excel to model the call prices. It is kind of limited and only works on one contract at a time (and it uses the actual dollar value, so 30$ instead of 0.3(x100) ).

Overnight after hours and hour pre-market has given us absolutely nothing to go off. From close till 645 SPY traded between 459.65 and 458.5. A dollar range is crazy tight for spy even after hours/ pre market. This morning we did see a low of 458.08 though.

As I mentioned in my TA last night we are now attempting to form a downward channel or at a minimum attempting to re-establish the lower support line before it tries to push higher. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hah6bu1etpq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e59df810dedc4c8a4b46f7383d10888ec4e1e04b

As you can see this current channel dates back all the way to March 21st. Intraday max move for channel puts resistance near 467-468 and support of channel is currently at 457. IF we were to fall through 457 intraday I would suspect we will officially refill the gap at 455.91 and potentially even retest supports in the 448 to 450 range. 

Currently SPY is giving us zero clues on where we may go and even with this inflation data this morning which really wasn‚Äôt that bad SPY isn‚Äôt doing too much.

Looking at the VIX we saw it reach a high of 20.27 so far and is currently sitting right at 19.95. 

Comparing the VIX level now to yesterday‚Ä¶

19.95 puts SPY near 457.5 to 458. 

20.27 puts SPY near 457. 

IT will be interesting to see if the VIX will pull spy back down or not. Currently looking at VIX it seems it wants to confirm an upward trend. 

Apple is back in the green today at 0.27% currently. After its struggles yesterday it will be something to watch to see if Apple can break higher or not.

This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction.

"9-7-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market AnalysisThe day of the bulls‚Ä¶ the day before father JPOW speaks‚Ä¶ the day of‚Ä¶? 

I think everyone wanted a trend day but everyone wanted/ expected a bearish trend day not a bullish trend day. If you were able to shake your bearish bias there was a lot of money to be made today. 

The trend of green open= red day and red open= green day so far holds true‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/x4dv6t47yhm91.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7fe22fadfb25c302dbfb03f8831e1da50cf0f44

One of the strongest 15min bull channels ive seen in a while. 

https://preview.redd.it/sl8orbp7yhm91.png?width=739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b82475d57633032efada5c8435665e5a184313e7

While I am overall bearish still, there is now a potential V-bottom forming on the SPY daily chart. 

Key support remains at 391.9 for that ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù support line and key resistance for the downward red bear channel remains at 398.2 tomorrow. 

With only 2 1%+ green days in the last 16 trading days this is a much needed oversold bounce to reset the indicators and allow for the next leg down. Especially if you read my last night TA where I showed the probability that end of week and next week are red due to CPI/ FOMC (we still have no cpi consensus‚Ä¶).

If we break the red bear channel down I will get nervous about my 14dte puts, however, if we were to hold the blue resistance line from the 430 top I would not be as worried. There is a nice setup to have a similar trend as August 25th/ 26th with a nice 398 double top forming tomorrow. If markets are setting up similarly to the Jackson hole where they rallied into JPOW speaking only to dump like crazy intraday (he speaks at 910am) we could see a similar move tomorrow. However, there if of course always a chance we see a bigger bounce green and could retest 405 by EOW.

One of the major bearish things is that the daily 8ema was not broken‚Ä¶ I think the correct thesis remains bearish as long as that daily 8ema holds as resistance. 

Key support remains- 391.9 and 390.4

Key resistance remains- 398.2 and 405.2

https://preview.redd.it/bmd3idb8yhm91.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0328db8ab4919d733bf5f59aa6763aebc1963b8d

SPY weekly continues to hold that blue 13 week long recovery line (despite futures/ apple breaking theirs). We are still looking at a downward bear channel on the weekly which could give a potential bounce back to 412.4 (unlikely honestly) this week. 

Another thing to keep an eye on is the current 392.1 weekly candle double bottom that is attempting to form. 

https://preview.redd.it/q0c7llx8yhm91.png?width=831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9be406cfa2f379b03e6e8e3c0db23b396c5501bf

Futures daily does not actually show the same v-bottom recovery as SPY. It just shows a near support bounce off that 3883 area to retest daily 8ema resistance before the next leg down. 

Key support- 3872

Key resistance- 3988 and 4000

https://preview.redd.it/f2jyhhh9yhm91.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de98c728b3462d311d32528a09eb3f5e9f6015a

Futures weekly is also showing a possible weekly double bottom at 3923 forming if we were to not visit the lows before Fridays market close. 

Weekly resistance for this bear channel is 4000 tomorrow with next weekly level resistance at 4025. 

Weekly support is 3900 then 3828.

https://preview.redd.it/uf3kpy1ayhm91.png?width=939&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4cec72f222b84e8da08467fbff9a94c5f615a7d6

Apple continues to remain the wild child. Intraday today and yesterday apple actually showed extreme weakness compared to the overall market and SPY. With apple only putting in a 0.93% green day compared to SPYs 1.8% green day Apple lagged most of the day. 

I believe part of that reason is that there was no sellers today on SPY hitting under 70mil currently with only 104% of the 30day average volume vs. Apple hitting 87mil and 127% of 30day average. Apple had a lot of sellers today. 

I was looking to see if Apple would close its back to back days under the daily 200ema, however, EOD it was able to pop its head over that resistance and couldn‚Äôt quite break down there. 

We saw a pretty healthy rejection at 156.5 today and we will continue to look at that as resistance. 

Key support- 155.5 (daily 200ema) -&gt; 154 -&gt; 152.2

Key resistance- 156.5 -&gt; 158.9 (red bear channel)

https://preview.redd.it/qx4jpjoayhm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aec7b99fc4afa9d4db3561285570ef22bfa59292

Apples weekly chart continues to remain bearish. It shows that there is room for a potential pump as high as even 161 without breaking that bearish trend down. However, we should look for the weekly 20ema at 157 and weekly 8ema at 159.5 to be heavy resistance if we see upward movement. 

Key support remains at 154 and if we were to break 154 I would be looking for 150. 

https://preview.redd.it/qo8ol5abyhm91.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=935dc72646b736e38f711f59fd84a945ab70dee9

VIX had a pretty large 8.44% sell off day today on this very green market day. It still is holding the recovery channel upward with a trajectory for the 30s. Key level to watch tomorrow remains at 24.3. If that holds and they close it back over 25.5 that would put things back on track for a bigger sell off eow and next week. 

I will be posting my CPI breakdown post later tonight. If you read it you will see that I am overall bearish for Friday this week and the rest of next week as historically the week prior to FOMC is a big red week (with previous FOMC the only outlier). 

https://preview.redd.it/m9zgl6sbyhm91.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d786a19a712343a0021dbcbbe7e3c8b69711f84

I am still holding this put and I did average it down after closing bell today. I still see a bigger sell off to come within the next two weeks (most of it happening next week). I do not have plans to average this down again. 

https://preview.redd.it/u1c4guacyhm91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c03603d12588f70a7dfd769d2890e4650ab44766

Tomorrow, we get yet another jobs report and as I said JPOW speaks ‚Äúat the CATO institutes 40th annual monetary conference.‚Äù What is he going to say? Im not sure but if its anything like Jackon Hole the market is not going to like it. With no CPI forecast still I still forsee a bearish tone from JPOW. There has not been a bullish fed member to speak in a very long time. And finally markets are actually listening to what JPOW is saying. Tomorrows opening is going to be SPICY‚Ä¶

10% challenge-

Overall a great day for me today. Took a loss on that put when I suspected we were going to see a sell off around 1215 when we broke then 15min 8ema. Other then that I didn‚Äôt trade much after 1230 as while I clear saw the bull trend day and that it most likely after that 1215a bounce was not going to break‚Ä¶ I had a lot of trust in it and chose to just sit cash instead of trading something I had no conviction in.

Nikkei - IV lines going back to 1984 used as indicators for buy points and resistance points. Nothing is 100% , what this does is provides you with a buying strategy with defined entry or exit points.   

Now if you extended those lines all the way out to present day you get this:

https://www.tradingview.com/x/AxHpq6Sf/

I found it interesting that most of the reversal points /rebound points are always near these lines or at a point that is equidistant from the bigger lines or half way between these lines within a few % points.  I also found it interesting that it is rare to see a ticker move pass 3 of these lines on the way down without some action around it or a minor rebound off it.

I utilize this to plan my entries. I adjust my entry sizes based on this. For example, maybe buy 10% at first line, 20% at second at 40% at 3rd. These entries will only be at most 30 to 50% of what I have available for this specific trade.  Otherwise I buy weekly at a specific amount per week.

"$SPX &amp; $AMD Momentum Plays and DD[Charts and graphs.](https://imgur.com/a/YmZL0Ss)  

**DISCLAIMER**  

Since I can't seem to figure out how to plot the lines 26 days ahead, as everything past the white line you see on the graph is meant to be trends/momentum 26 days in the future--Visualize the lines as going ahead of the current day's price.  

**DD**  

For those of you who do not know analysis using Ichimoku Clouds go [here.](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:ichimoku_cloud)  

**$SPX:** Prices are converging on the cloud so expect the onset of a bearish trend. Expect some near term resistance to upward movement for the S&amp;P (especially when the cloud turns red in ~14 days). Watch for a death cross (Tenken blue line crosses Senkou(52) red line) and prices moving below the red line. That will signal that momentum has shifted and you better scramble to get puts. MACD converging but difference is still well above 1. RSI is still in an ok spot.  

**$AMD**: RSI is very high, signalling being overbought. MACD difference below 1 signalling not-so-strong of a bullish trend compared to when you just analyze the conversion (tenken) and base line (senkou B(52)). Prices are above the cloud which indicates a bullish trend but expect resistance to further rises in the near term. Conversely, if it falls there will be no resistance to buoy it up.  

**TL;DR**: Japanese man in '60s looks at shape of clouds for market DD. Buy puts if reversals in trend happen as there will be future resistance (barring news catalysts). Otherwise, be cautious on calls in the next month, look for large dips instead of buying at the high.

"Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and holdEvery other comment right now is a shill lamenting the stupidity of everyone who‚Äôs still holding or how sad it is the big guy won again or some other gloomy horseshit. 

To all of you who are out there who‚Äôve ever thought ‚Äúoh man, if I‚Äôd only bought X stock X years ago I‚Äôd be rich!‚Äù - if you aren‚Äôt holding right now, you‚Äôre wrong. 

I‚Äôm an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn‚Äôt sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I‚Äôm holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it‚Äôs too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin‚Äôs mistake? No actual hedging. Don‚Äôt be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won‚Äôt help if you‚Äôre making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I‚Äôve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don‚Äôt give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren‚Äôt the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It‚Äôs not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we‚Äôre in dire straits probably didn‚Äôt comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold. Do you want to be the ‚ÄúGolly I could‚Äôve had Apple 20 years ago!‚Äù guy for the rest of your life, or do you wanna be the strong motherfucker who actually took the leap?",0

Prepare for massive losses (both non-GAAP and GAAP) in Q1 and Q2.

THE BUSINESS MODEL DOESN'T SCALE) towards ""positive cash flows"". This will happen in Q3 once the federal tax credit goes away. Here's how:

* selling down inventory in the face of a demand spurt created by the impending expiration of the full Federal Income Tax (or FIT) credit for EVs,
* collecting Model Y deposits,
* selling ZEV credits it has hoarded for several quarters,
* adjusting accruals and stock-based compensation,
* throttling back leasing and/or pushing leases to third parties, and
* including (as it has done in the past) money owed to VIE investors as part of its operating cash flow.",0

"SPY Scalping Strategy - 1 or 2 Day tradeSo let me start by saying that I have tried several different strategies with about every timeframe as I have been trading for over 10 years. However I am a swing trader and would like to get better at scalps especially on a single ticker like SPY or QQQ etc. 

Does anyone have an options strategy that works over 50% of the time? I would love to start a basic discussion on the following 

1) what indicators are you using. If it‚Äôs moving averages please be specific with SMA or EMA and how you are using it. 

2) what time frame are you using these indicators on 

3) what option strike are you trading. Are you trading the closest daily expiration or maybe the weekly or monthly. Are you buying at the money, in the money or out of the money

4) how are you exiting. 


I will start. 

I like the 5 and 20 EMA on a five minute combined with Stocastics on a regular setting 

I try to get at the money options with the daily expiration or sometimes an expiration with a week away just in case the direction changes quickly on me I have more time to recover

I enter at the cross of the 5 and 20 and exit at the first resistance line I see. I mark the resistance lines with the 15 minute chart.",1

More details in the full text of the below Bloomberg article for the few of you whose attention span exceeds 10 seconds. I **bolded** the important parts.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-31/gamestop-short-nightmare-shows-few-signs-of-becoming-a-contagion?sref=2CO9MdgW](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-31/gamestop-short-nightmare-shows-few-signs-of-becoming-a-contagion?sref=2CO9MdgW)

# GameStop Short Nightmare Shows Few Signs of Becoming a Contagion

[GameStop Corp.‚Äôs](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US) surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent. But those **bearish positions probably aren‚Äôt big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds**.

That‚Äôs the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market‚Äôs capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**

Whether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week‚Äôs selling -- the worst in the S&amp;P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they‚Äôre unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.

 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don‚Äôt have an outsize influence**,‚Äù said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. ‚Äú**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.‚Äù

Burned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.

While the **S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**. To JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.‚Äôs strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a ‚Äúshort-lived technical tumble.‚Äù With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.

 To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020‚Äôs pandemic market.

‚ÄúAlthough the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,‚Äù Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop‚Äôs ticker. ‚ÄúWhile we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.‚Äù

By Barclays‚Äôs tally, **short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves**. The heavily shorted companies -- those with interest making up more than 20% of their share float -- saw $40 billion of their stock sold short, or 5% of the total pool of bearish bets.

‚ÄúWe remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,‚Äù Deshpande said. ‚Äú**The bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term, the risk of a full-fledged contagion remains low**.‚Äù",1

# April 12 Recap

Stocks fell as oil prices rose above $100 per barrel, reigniting inflation fears, while big banks fell ahead of the start of the financial earnings season on Wednesday.

The S&amp;P 500 erased gains that had previously been driven by speculation that price pressures were nearing a peak. JPMorgan will be the first of the top six banks to report earnings, with Wall Street focusing on how the volatility caused by the Ukraine war affected investment banking and trading operations.

Treasury 10-year yields fell after reaching their highest level since December 2018.

Oil has surpassed $100 per barrel.

The rise in crude oil prices, along with other commodities, has fueled inflation fears, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively. Gasoline prices accounted for half of the monthly increase in the US consumer price index in March. Nonetheless, core inflation increased less than expected, owing in large part to the largest drop in used-car prices since 1969 and a slowing in price growth in other merchandise categories.

On the geopolitical front, Russian President Putin stated that peace talks with Ukraine have stalled and vowed to continue his military operation in the country, despite calling the conflict a ""tragedy."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy has called for additional European Union sanctions against Russia, including oil and all banks.

That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.

As many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important. 

So what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.

The reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.

Over the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.

Also, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!

This is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.

"AMZN earnings DD
This was longer than I expected..but here you go.  Hope the formatting works

Revenue
The bar is low.....expecting only 59.7B revenue vs 51B last year.(72.38B last quarter). 

Prediction: They easily beat on revenue.

AWS
Analysts are expecting 7.7B, last quarter was 7.4B...this will smashed by at least 2B.
MSFT grew cloud by 41% to 9.6B....if AMZN is close to a 40% gain, it puts AWS over 10B (7.4B last quarter)

Prediction: Absolutly kills it in cloud

DOD deal
10B DOD cloud deal up for grabs..AMZN is the only company with DOD DISA L6 security level. MSFT is expecting to get it..but has not received it yet. 
Prediction: Could go either way. The government seems to wants MSFT but without clearance AMZN gets it

EPS
Analyst expect 4.72 eps vs 6.04,5.75,5.07 last 3 quarter. Costs will be up, but also revenue up...this will be close to expected.

Outlook
AMZN finally announce they are out of china but will still sell there..they were taking a loss on this market. AMZN is the cloud leader and the market is sky rocketing, we saw this from MSFT. Even though msft is catching up..there is still plenty of money for both companies. Things look good

What about the stock
As with always..Bad earnings or good earnings...AMZN stock could go either direction.

RSI &gt; 70, overbought but that didn't matter for MSFT

The $1925 straddle is priced for a 4% move. AMZN shouldnt move below $1809 or above $2002.

Last quarter Amazon rose sharply into earnings(+2.8% day of)..but lost it after the ER..basically flat overall.",1
"$AMZN CallsAMZN looking ripe for calls of course as along as the market holds on and doesn't sell off. The RSI is at 29 on daily and is diverging positively. It bounced off 200 day MA twice in two days so we know that $1752 is good support. It has only hit this low of RSI in May and December and rallied $300 plus since. We also got a Doji and hammer candlesticks. 

Analysts had upgraded it with 2300 or so PT. It is all gambling but odds are looking good as long as market doesn't sell off and Bezos stops selling his shares.",1

note: **I have been wrong 3/4 last predictions so please inverse me**



**Cons**:

Let's start with the facts. Broadcom, TI and Qualcomm reported earnings stating that expectations for modems have tapered recently due to the iphone. Please see QCOM's latest transcript here:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/top-iphone-suppliers-warn-of-slower-sales-ahead-of-apple-results?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;utm_campaign=headline&amp;cmpId=yhoo.headline&amp;yptr=yahoo

Samsung also gave cautious guidance to OLED for mobile for 2018. In their CC, Samsung reported **23%** lower revenue than guidance for OLED for mobile phones.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Poor-iPhone-X-sales-weigh-down-Samsung-s-Oct.-Dec.-results

Furthermore, China mobile sales were very weak as compared to other years.
https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/MediaTek-expects-headwinds-in-China-mobile-market-in-2018





**Pros:**
1) 
The bloomberg article did not mention that Apple is now using intel modems (https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/31/apple-inc-may-have-wanted-to-use-intel-corps-modem.aspx). 
(https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/01/qualcomm-iphone-x-still-faster-than-intel/)
In fact during intel's CC, they've reported a huge growth in their mobile business unit.

2) 
The Korean Won was very strong this quarter due to bank of korea raising rates and growing peace between North and South. This headwind can account for 5% of the 23% lower revenue in OLED for mobile. Furthermore, we don't know exactly how much of the OLED goes to Apple although Samsung has exclusive rights to make the OLEDs for the Iphone X. 

Cautious guidance can be explained by other OLED mfgs such as LG's.

Therefore, it is my conclusion that Iphone X sales (in units) have moderated about 10%, but not as bad as other analysts have predicted. However, in revenue ($ USD) due to the weak dollar, Apple may have in fact beaten guidance despite the lukewarm sales.  

3) 
Latest Foxconn sales have shown a huge increase in revenue. Mark Hibben (Seeking Alpha) attributes the growth to the Iphone X sales solely.
https://i.imgur.com/ZXL1b8o.png

4) Apple's services will grow by more than 20% YoY. This is where the real growth is coming from. http://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/apple-siri-now-active-500m-devices/

5) Taxes and the 350B spending spree. This is self-explanatory. I believe that Apple has been using this quarter as an experimental period where they want to take the next GIANT leap in progress - just like what Mark Zuckerberg has done. They both know that they can get away with it - which is totally fair. Please see my previous post to cite for your research: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7txxw7/isnt_it_to_apples_benefit_to_lower_aapl_to/
   


6) Qorvo, an Apple supplier, has seen a bit weaker revenue but expects encouraging growth in later half of 2018:



7) TSMC reported 10nm revenue in the 2 consecutive quarters of 2.55E9  USD. Since virtually all 10nm goes to Apple at the moment, we see 2.55E9/($26 cost for A11)*1E-6 &lt;= (upper bound) 98M IPhone X sold. Although this is an upper bound, this is way way higher than the estimates calling for 15-20M.

*With Apple‚Äôs softer holiday sell-through being well reported over the past several weeks and QRVO‚Äôs stock already having declined about 20% from its highs in November, investors look to have already largely factored in QRVO‚Äôs lighter guidance, with the company‚Äôs shares remaining relatively flat in after-hours trading.
Also likely helping to support QRVO‚Äôs share price is its indication of ‚Äúrecent developments with mid/high-band PADs and Phase 6 design wins‚Äù, which include mid/high-band and low-band integrated PAD modules.  The company also sampled a custom mid/high-band PAD to an additional tier-one smartphone OEM. These mid/high-band PAD are significant as it has been the lack of high-performance BAW filter shipments that have recently weighed on its gross margins, particularly as it previously earned a high volume low-band PAD design with its largest customer that used SAW filters instead of the firm‚Äôs BAW designs.
Update: The stock has now staged quite an impressive turnaround, surging by $6.43, or almost 9%, at $78.20, and at one point almost 10% higher this evening. One thing that may be helping the company are remarks by management on the call that later this year, it expects to see the biggest-ever content gains in Apple products that it has ever seen for its wireless parts.**
https://www.barrons.com/articles/qorvo-stock-already-reflects-weak-apple-results-says-drexel-1517437350?mod=hp_RTA&amp;




**Conclusion**:  Analysts have been deceptively scooping your shares, and Apple is using this time to experiment and take the risks needed to still be innovative in an era where value and growth are perceived to not go hand in hand.

"Tesla (TSLA) is now one of the safest Vehicles in ExistenceNow, the Model Y crash test video has been released, and the results look good. According to the NHTSA website, the Model Y scored 5 stars in every category. Specifically, the rollover test showed a rollover risk of only 7.9%, compared with the Chevy Equinox, a similarly sized gas-powered vehicle, with a rollover risk of 18.5%, more than double.

In translation - one of the most IMPORTANT things when it comes to vehicles is safety. I mean I would opt for a safer vehicle any day. This is going to work wonders when it comes to trusting Tesla with Atonomous Driving going into the future. I find this to be really good news and it‚Äôs comforting to see they scored so highly in every category.

"STOP SLEEPING ON AMDAMD is currently trading at a 10% discount thanks to the Intel bulls (AMD bears) who believe their new CEO can make their stock move - except this loser couldn't even make his previous company (VMW) move during the biggest bull market of our time. VMW has traded side ways for the last 52 weeks! (wtf)

Just days ago AMD hit an all time high of $99, today it's at $90. 
I'm sure some of you remember the massive rocket ship üöÄ SuBae gave us back when everyone was praying to her before their mother tucked them in at night. Well, it's time to start dreaming of Dr. Lisa Su again because the only place AMD is going IS UP until at least until 2024. While Intel are crying about getting hulk smashed by SuBae, AMD keeps stealing massive market share, and the corona has increased the need for computers so much that TSM (the foundry who makes the chips for AMD) are at max capacity and will be for several years. The only other company that can compete with TSM is Samsung who are also at max capacity. Meanwhile, Intel's fabs are several years behind.

I know you guys don't like to read so here's the CliffsNotes version:

* AMD growing at rocket speedüöÄ

* 20% of server market by EOY (Currently at 10%, up from 1% 2 years ago)

* Notebook market share growing by 50% (Lisa just announced this at CES a few days ago)

* Most products are constantly sold out - just look at all the people crying over at r/AMD and all those people that still can't buy PS5's. 

* AMD powers both XBOX and PS. PS5 sales topped 3.4 million units in the first 4 weeks. Sony has had to increase production by 50%!

* TSM are trying to build new fabs asap to increase production of CPU's - Today they reported a 23% increase in profits.

* PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade.
 
* The gaming PC market is set to grow 25% by 2024

* Intel's competitive advantage (their own fabs) is so useless that they are trying to buy space at the already full TSM fab. 

* Intel are 2-3 years behind AMD. 

* r/intel = 205,452 users, r/amd = 765,440 (hmmmmmm)

* Lisa Su always delivers the promised numbers every quarter 

Oh yeah, and mad lad **CRAMER** [just told everyone to load up during this buying opportunity.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/intel-shakeup-creates-buying-opportunity-in-amd-jim-cramer-says.html)

These are the same losers who just got wrecked by GME. Let's show these fools again. **Stop letting boomers control the OG WSB rocket ship!**

**TL;DR -** AMD is an undervalued sleeping giant currently on sale. Most analysts predict $110, some $120. [235/384 people](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kwthxy?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=AMD_Stock&amp;utm_content=t3_kwthxy) on r/amd_stock believe it will be $150+ in Jan 2022.

https://www.techpowerup.com/256842/intel-internal-memo-reveals-that-even-intel-is-impressed-by-amds-progress
For the first time you have a CPU lineup that is competitive in all aspects, not only multicore, but also single core. Before, AMD might have only appealed to Budget and workstation users, AMD can appeal to every single part of the market. Leaks show that AMD is either on par, or even beating intel, at a much lower price point. Intel has slashed prices as a result. 

OEMs are starting to choose AMD over Intel, as they start seeing cost savings, at no impact to performance.

Laptops, a market traditionally locked down by intel, also facing a rise in AMD based devices.

Finally, servers. Intel makes most of their moolah on servers, where they can jack up the prices because there is no real competition. AMD has also come in, guns blazing, with server chips that are finally worth paying attention to. Google's stadia (game streaming service) is running off of AMD. Fixes to recent CPU vulnerabilities like meltdown, spectre, Rowhammer, all (significantly) affect Intel computing performance, something that enterprise customers care about a lot. AMD has been a lot more uptight about their security.

Intel has a market cap of 200 bil, while AMD has a market cap of 30 bil. AMD is definitely not going to 200 bil, but there is room for growth.

Concerns: P/E ratio of AMD is a little high, 121 vs Intel's 10. Could be a little overpriced, considering how a lot of investors realize the value in AMD. P/E ratio of 40 is normal in semiconductors.

However, considering room for future, explosive growth, I think it literally can't go tits up.

Long AMD, price target $60 (if you hold) I'll probably hold for 4 months.

"BABA going to make moves like TSLALook at 10 year {only} chart of TSLA &amp; also of BABA; BABA going on only of 8 years now since ipo.
 The similarities on the technicals are just as TSLA was June 2020 after its peak from a previous approx 3 years before 70‚Äôs to lower 40‚Äôs. 
 BABA total geopolitical stock manipulation has taken and held it down though is one of the 10 only companies in the world doing the numbers it is doing. This company is more into that we know of robotics retail brick and mortar IR glasses stuff that we don‚Äôt even know about just to name a few. If anyone has ever been to China or knows anybody in this country that deals with a Taobao platform will know how this company really works. Their purchase of the supermarket chain comparable to our Whole Foods and Amazon was just acquired two years ago and even that is expanding. 
  I don‚Äôt know if anybody remembers when Trump was in office he was going to have a Alibaba plant put in New Jersey that something happened with that we know he wasn‚Äôt friends with Bezos to begin with. 
 The fact is this company is going to be one of the biggest companies on the planet and he‚Äôs doing the numbers to prove it it‚Äôs actually step of head of Apple or Apple was in 2012, we all know the story from there 
  the Democratic Party former Al Gore if you look up today they just added a huge position into Alibaba coincidental June trading starts this week. Here it is:
 The investment firm co-founded and chaired by former Vice President Al Gore has made big changes in its U.S.-traded investments.

Generation Investment Management loaded up on shares of Chinese online giant Alibaba Group Holding (ticker: BABA) and cloud firm Salesforce.com (CRM) in the first quarter, exited an investment in networking giant Cisco Systems ( CSCO), and halved an investment in software behemoth Microsoft (MSFT).

The firm, which is based in London, disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Generation, which is focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, declined to comment on the investment changes. The firm managed more than $36 billion of assets as of March 31.

Generation bought 629,639 additional Alibaba American depositary receipts to end the first quarter with 4.4 million ADRs. Alibaba ADRs fell 8.4% in the first quarter, compared with a 5% slip in the S&amp;P 500 index; so far in the second quarter, ADRs have dropped 14%, compared with a 8.2% slip in the index.

Alibaba has faced potential delisting in the U.S. Still, the NYSE expects more Chinese listings in the U.S. Alibaba has been hurt by China's zero-Covid policy, in addition to an overall softer e-commerce market for retail.

Spending has remained strong in digitizing Ed? and or is there something else missing? boosting Salesforce. Investors, however, remain wary of a potential demand slowdown. The prospect of a recession looms, and Salesforce is one of several companies that have already moved to curtail hiring.
 I‚Äôm just going by Teslas technicals on the chart starting the next 30 days of Alibaba the potential is there for 140% gain by October of this year with a January tax gain selling in 2023 after to take back over in March 2023; the next six months will be the start and how  it goes from there into next year will reflect on the gain in the next six months now.",0

"AMD Q1 2019 PREDICTIONS &amp; PLAYS**AMD Q1 2019 PREDICTIONS &amp; PLAYS**

People are starting to look beyond the numbers at AMD vs Intel, and they are starting to question anything that Intel has to say about their fabrication process improvements. Negatives for Intel include: CPU IPC has been largely stagnant for the past FOUR years. For those not familiar, IPC is Instructions Per Clock. It has nothing to do with the number of CPU cores, or the speed of a chip, and is entirely about how many instructions are executed per clock cycle. So a 2.0GHz chip with ah higher IPC will perform better than a 2.0GHz chip with a lower IPC. If the clock speeds increase, performance will go up, but newer chips with the same IPC won't be any faster when running at that 2.0GHz speed.

With Inte, 10nm being delayed itself would just mean that clock speeds won't go up, but a lack of any IPC improvements show that Intel is not improving the design of its chips well enough. So, what has Intel been doing over the past FOUR years where IPC hasn't improved? Intel finally improved the thermal interface material for better cooling of the chip itself(under the cover), so you see some speed increases, but there were already enthusiasts who were removing the lid from the chip to do this improvement themselves;, and the results has shown that the chips themselves have not really been improved, the news chips have better assembly.

So, AMD....When AMD first launched Ryzen in 2017, many people were surprised, if not shocked. Not only did AMD release 8 core chips(while Intel had stayed with 4 core chips) in the consumer space, but the new Zen core design was fairly competitive on an IPC basis as well. This allowed AMD to be every competitive with their new chips, and the only advantage that Intel had was a slight advantage in IPC, as well as high clock speeds. AMD offering double the number of cores did make Ryzen a very competitive product in most areas. Since that time, AMD boosted the IPC from first to second generation, as well as providing a bit better clock speed. Looking forward, the third generation Ryzen chips are expected in the next months (announcement and specs due on May 27th), with a 13-15% IPC improvement over second generation, and potentially a jump of 20% in clock speeds. Yes, this is a 20% boost on top of the 13-15% performance boost even at the previous speeds, so you can see how big of a jump this is expected to be, depending on clock speeds.

AMD isn't stagnant in IPC, isn't stagnant in clock speeds, and may even double the core counts to 16 cores in consumer grade chips. This is why things look very promising for AMD in the second half of 2019. Intel isn't expected to have 10nm desktop chips ready before 2021 at this point, so that is why those who understand the technology see so much potential for AMD right now. AMD has at the very least, a year where it will be well ahead of Intel. Q1 and Q2 are the periods before the new chips are released, and many are waiting to buy the new chips, so a slowdown in sales SHOULD be expected.

"How to play extremely high-risk FDs with 1000% upside. With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I've been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.

Since you all love throwing your money away, I'll share how I play FDs. I cannot understate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won't go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you're serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.

I only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I'll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It's possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I'll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don't go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. 

In my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn't a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you're only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don't mess with FDs if I'm only looking at a realistic upside of 500%.

**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**
-

I haven't bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I've bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. 

So, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn't like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ's results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn't have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.

Thus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.

-

**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you'll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. 

1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. 

2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We're banking on some unexpected volatility. 

3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it's all over. 

4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. 

5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ's average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I'm predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that's more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it's a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ's yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday's close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.

6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren't really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.

-

And now onto the actual play.

* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**

These are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday's closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. 

If this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say ""Wednesday noon"", I don't actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. 

These estimates are going to be off because we're dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you're trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I'm not wrong often.

By the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you're down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.

-

**Apple ($AAPL)**
-

I personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I'll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. 

* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**

These calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. 

Reasoning in decreasing significance: 

1. Apple's earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. 

2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn't only because they're both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. 

3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. 

4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn't a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don't go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. 

5. With the tax cuts and Apple's big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they're good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.

-

As always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there's a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn't go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road. ",0

"Short term SPY calls, long term VIX buysWoke up today looking at SPY creeping up to ATH again. Cheers bulls, I salute you. Well done. As a contrarian pessimist, I can say that you guys get the cake.

But in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, ""How's the VIX? Been a while since I've seen that thing make the news."" And it's hovering around 13.50. Just broke 1 year low. The contrarian pessimist in me says, ""Surely this is it! The next bad tweet will send this skyrocketing!"" But I don't know when, and I don't feel like letting theta destroy my dignity while I wait. If there's one thing I have learned, it's that the stock market likes to grow slowly over time with short, dramatic selloffs occasionally decorating the charts for the sake of variety. So here's my plan.

VIX ATH in the last crash was above 50. ATL was Sep 2017 at about 9.50. We're at 13.50 right now. Bull or bear, I think we can all agree that this has been a LONG bull run. With the end of every bull market, one can expect high volatility. On top of that, Q4 is usually a volatile quarter because of end of year accounting. Companies need to get rid of any short term losses they may be holding for tax purposes. So here we are, late bull cycle, Q4, trade war, and VIX hovering around ATL. 

I can't say when, because the market can be irrational longer than I can be solvent. I don't feel like letting options destroy my capital waiting for the market to agree with me. But holding a leveraged volatility fund? At this point it just seems stupid not to do it.

In the short term, the market will display irrational exuberance before the bubble bursts. My trading money is still going with the trend to buy SPY calls as long as the market is blissfully happy. But of the $40 range between $10 and $50 in which the VIX has ALWAYS traded, we're in the bottom 10% of that very consistent tunnel. And with a leveraged fund like TVIX, that could turn into astronomical returns the next time Mr. Market forgets to take his meds.",0

"Long $AMD, Massive Intel In-Hardware Security Bug Found (Hotfix Requires -30% Perf Penalty)You faggots doubted SuBae, but her journey to the moon is undaunted by your cum-guzzling ways. 

Confirmed homosexual firm, $INTC, will be announcing [a massive in-hardware security bug in its modern processors that will require a **-30% performance penalty** to hotfix it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/intel_bug_incoming/). This will notably affect large datacenter customers such as $GOOG and $AMZN (short them for maximum tendies). 

* As an in-hardware bug, this is not easy to fix and will require a brutal hotfix as a temporary measure. A less destructive fix will not be available until the hardware is replaced with updated models in the coming years (as if customers would choose to buy more $INTC products after this!). 

* The bug is currently under embargo much like $INTC is still officially in the closet. In the coming days, $INTC will publicly acknowledge its sexual orientation and the existence of this bug. 

* [$INTC's CEO sold off $11M of $INTC stock less than two weeks ago](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/19/intels-ceo-just-sold-a-lot-of-stock.aspx) and now holds the bare minimum number of shares required by the CEO according to $INTC by-laws. Looks like he's getting his yacht while he still can! 

* Competing processors made by SuBae are confirmed to not be affected by this vulnerability as their architecture is much girthier. 

This leaves **SuBae poised to fuck the competition up the ass** on large datacenter contracts. 

* $AMD has recently [ramped up production on their 32-core ""EPYC"" CPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12032/amd-announces-wider-epyc-availability-and-rocm-17-with-tensorflow-support) that competes in the datacenter market. 

* Not only does the 32C EPYC have more cores than $INTC's flaccid 28C CPU, but [EPYC costs half as much](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11544/intel-skylake-ep-vs-amd-epyc-7000-cpu-battle-of-the-decade/10). 

* SuBae is rumored to release an [EPYC 2.0 with an even more turgid 64-core CPU as early as 2019](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-2-64-cores-128-threads-and-256mb-l3-cache). 

 * Impotent traitor, [Raja Kodorki, is confirmed to not be involved with Epyc in any way](http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-boss-raja-koduri-joins-intel-to-work-on-integrated-and-discrete-graphics/) and will only be adding performance issues to $INTC products going forward. 

* SuBae won't rest until EPYC is packed deep into datacenters everywhere, leaving $INTC frustrated and on the streets to beg for tendies. 

I see **$AMD trading at $15 by weeks end**. It's yacht time, faggots. ",1

"Some basic TSLA Tech Analysis for you Smooth-Brained ApesSo, TSLA, along w/ the rest of the Tech stocks is on a downward trajectory, which leads to the obvious question: When does it stop so I can buy in and maximize my upside potential?

I took a look at some historical Moving Averages to get an idea of how far this may go and my initial conclusions are below:

1. Crashed through the 50-day SMA on 21 Feb and has stayed &gt;10% below since.  This MA has historically been TSLA's support level and staying below leads me to think it may be here a while.
2. 100-day SMA is the next logical support level, which is $625 so I'll be watching closely to see if the downward trajectory continues at the same rate, or starts to level out as it approaches that 100-day SMA support level.

The stock is at $688 now so that 100-day SMA isn't really far off and it could rebound sharply so set your alerts and/or limits, raid your wife's boyfriend's wallet, and hang on for a fun, and potentially lucrative opportunity.

"Short term SPY calls, long term VIX buysWoke up today looking at SPY creeping up to ATH again. Cheers bulls, I salute you. Well done. As a contrarian pessimist, I can say that you guys get the cake.

But in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, ""How's the VIX? Been a while since I've seen that thing make the news."" And it's hovering around 13.50. Just broke 1 year low. The contrarian pessimist in me says, ""Surely this is it! The next bad tweet will send this skyrocketing!"" But I don't know when, and I don't feel like letting theta destroy my dignity while I wait. If there's one thing I have learned, it's that the stock market likes to grow slowly over time with short, dramatic selloffs occasionally decorating the charts for the sake of variety. So here's my plan.

VIX ATH in the last crash was above 50. ATL was Sep 2017 at about 9.50. We're at 13.50 right now. Bull or bear, I think we can all agree that this has been a LONG bull run. With the end of every bull market, one can expect high volatility. On top of that, Q4 is usually a volatile quarter because of end of year accounting. Companies need to get rid of any short term losses they may be holding for tax purposes. So here we are, late bull cycle, Q4, trade war, and VIX hovering around ATL. 

I can't say when, because the market can be irrational longer than I can be solvent. I don't feel like letting options destroy my capital waiting for the market to agree with me. But holding a leveraged volatility fund? At this point it just seems stupid not to do it.

In the short term, the market will display irrational exuberance before the bubble bursts. My trading money is still going with the trend to buy SPY calls as long as the market is blissfully happy. But of the $40 range between $10 and $50 in which the VIX has ALWAYS traded, we're in the bottom 10% of that very consistent tunnel. And with a leveraged fund like TVIX, that could turn into astronomical returns the next time Mr. Market forgets to take his meds.",0

We are all, myself included, very dumb. I'm not gonna come on here spouting doom and gloom DD with the guarantee that I am correct about any of my convictions. I have been a member of this subreddit for a couple of years at this point, and anyone who has been here long enough to rub their remaining two brain cells together and miraculously conjure up an original thought should be able to come to the conclusion that any DD on this subreddit that somehow contains an accurate market prediction is almost always the product of sheer luck mixed with a dash of plagiarism and confirmation bias.

Now that we got that out of the way, I have some shit to show you. This might not be new information to some of you, and I know a few of you have noticed this shit already. This post is for the people who blindly trade SPY FDs based on the daily discussion in this subreddit and can barely read a chart. Hopefully, this information inspires you to learn how to read candlesticks.

Who am I kidding, none of us can read candlesticks. None of us can even read. That's why I included lots of charts with colors and shit because most of you gave up reading after the first two sentences.

**Things You Need to Understand Before You Read Further:**

*Elliott Wave Theory -* This theory just basically says that people buy and sell in a predictable 5 wave pattern due to the concept of herd mentality among investors. Waves 1, 3, and 5 are long and predictable uptrends (new investors enter bullish positions because everyone else is bullish). Waves 2 and 4 are short and unpredictable countertrends (investors are now getting cold feet because the price has been moving up for a while and there is uncertainty as to whether the current price accurately represents the value of a share, so people sell). Wave 5 is always followed by a relatively large countertrend correction.

*Trends and Countertrends -* A trend (in this context) usually just means a bull market. Price is moving upwards, followed by a small correction, followed by another period of bullish price movement. This is when you should be trading because **trends are predictable.** Countertrends are the bearish price corrections that occur after a bullish trend in order to confirm support levels. Countertrends can take many different forms and are therefore very unpredictable. **You should not trade during countertrends because, again, price movement is not predictable.** 

I was going to go on to explain some bearish patterns and other basic jargon but I know you're not gonna read it. If you aren't familiar with the triple top, head and shoulders, Fibonacci retracement, or support and resistance lines please stop reading and run a quick Google search on those terms.

**Okay. Here's the Deal.**

In 2018, the S&amp;P 500 experienced a terrible sell-off in December due to fears of the Fed tightening monetary policy, a slowing economy, and deteriorating trade relations with China. It dropped almost 10 percent. Check out this chart.

If you ever looked up images relating to the ""Triple Top"" pattern, you've seen this chart.

Looking at these three charts, we could easily circle-jerk talking about a recession until our balls fall off just like every other post in this subreddit that contains these images and is drawing those conclusions. Instead, I'll just show you my analysis and let you draw your own, very intelligent conclusions that I am sure are not based on fear or greed whatsoever.

Stock drops after an aggressive push upwards, forming a new resistance line at the peak. Following this, new support will form at a level that I have deemed the ""oh fuck"" zone, or a zone in which the price will breach critical support and plummet to a new low. You'll notice that there are recurring patterns and sequences that present themselves in every chart that I will show you after this brief breakdown of the ""oh fuck"" pattern.

It usually goes like this:

1. Stock drops after an aggressive push upwards, forming a new resistance line at the peak.
2. SPY fights back above that resistance line but is unable to produce a trend upwards. It then tumbles down below this resistance.
3. After that, you'll see bearish price action as SPY gasps for air but is unable to successfully recover above resistance.
4. The ""oh fuck"" zone is breached and SPY dumps. Hard.

Here's the 2018 chart. It's easy to analyze because it's very cut and dry.

&amp;#x200B;

[The \\""Oh Fuck\\"" Zone \(2018\)](https://preview.redd.it/qwmnkelj1sx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ba591bed177665f6e560e3ba1df29028bc3c972)

Here's the crash of 2008.

And here's where we are now.

Now, you might be thinking ""but how do you know this isn't a trendy move and we're not just gonna shoot up from here? Don't stocks only go up? It's easy to draw lines on a chart for price moves that have already happened"", and honestly, you'd be correct. I don't know for a fact that this is a guaranteed recession signal. For example, here's a chart showing where SPY recovered from a similar pattern in 2019.

&amp;#x200B;

[An example of SPY recovering from the \\""oh fuck\\"" pattern, 2019](https://preview.redd.it/xtvewx2e4sx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ec073c233e4611271f0a265ba4492dfe3fba270)

**Now, how do we know when to expect these patterns?** 

I'm glad you asked. This is where the Elliott Waves come into play. We can predict the severity of bearish price movement by determining where we are on the Elliott Wave pattern. If we are on waves 1 or 3, we can expect the countertrends of waves 2 or 4 to be relatively short and mild. If we are on wave 5, we can expect a shitshow as soon as the 5th wave trend ends. 

And guess where we are now. That's right. We are in the middle of a massive countertrend following the previous 5th wave trend. This happens every couple of years, but we are overdue for the big one. Here's a chart showing our current position on the Elliott Waves.

&amp;#x200B;

[Our Current Position Along the Elliott Wave](https://preview.redd.it/a1wt5nxuktx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7abc8d8176cb58394459c250c0a6b811899428a1)

In all honesty, there's no telling where we go from here. But one thing is for certain, this is a massive countertrend. Keep in mind that the term ""countertrend"" doesn't mean that the price only goes down. It might go up and down over a period of time. Being in a countertrend really just means that we are in the middle of price movement that is not trendy, or goes against the previous trend. We can't accurately predict the price movement of a countertrend, which is why we are all getting fucked on moves that we thought we had all figured out. If you still don't understand, here's a couple charts showing you what a countertrend really looks like and the unpredictability that lies within.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, there is money to be made on both Call and Put options within these trends at certain points. If you still want to participate in the market during this absolute shit circus, here's a couple methods I would suggest using before entering any positions. 

**Yet Another Post Comparing 2022 to 2008**

I know that this has been done before. A lot. But it's almost obligatory that I include a hypothetical scenario regarding our current SPY price to the 2008 chart. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Here's a side-by-side without drawings or markers.](https://preview.redd.it/ff3tkaointx81.png?width=2880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba835731f29dcd5c1aa4f60b25ecadda55cda6b8)

""It's not identical! some of the price moves are way longer or shorter"", yes I know. You are right about this as well. This map is mainly here to highlight the similarities in price action and how the market responded to those movements. And those reactions mimic each other very well. This kind of price action doesn't happen every day. But of course, formulate your own opions based on your own research. Don't let me stop you from buying those weekly calls.

If I were to guess, I'd say we hit 450 again before we dump. We might dump before then, I can't guarantee anything. Fuck it, we might not even dump at all. But I know for certain that if SPY cannot break the resistance above 450 and produce a bullish trend, we will dump harder than you ever thought was possible. With JPOW's speech at the FOMC basically saying ""fuck it we ball"", there is no real solution being presented in order to fix this massive looming economic correction. In fact, this potential recession is key to recovering the health of the economy. It might be the only thing that can fix this shit. I mean, you gotta remember that recessions are necessary for a healthy economy and they are inevitable. Of course, better monetary policy could have been enacted to soften the blow, but it's a bit too late for that.

**So...**

Here's a Fib trend retracement of SPY currently.

The grey line is very near our current ""oh fuck"" zone. If it is breached, we're fucked. To support this, here's a chart of 2008 with a Fibonaci Trend retracement.

So yeah.

Get ready for a possible fakeout to 450-460 followed by a sell-off and then a dump to the depths of hell if price moves below 405-400 for longer than a couple of days. 

...Maybe. 

Draw your own conclusions for once, dingus. 

TLDR

We might actually be super fucked this time. Buy weekly calls up to $450 on red days. If it actually gets up there, buy Puts at $350 expiring in August.

Turns out, I was right about the future and I don't plan to sell a single share for at least five years, maybe ten.

"SPY/ QQQ February 2nd... is the short term bull run over? Dead cat bounce confirmed? ü§îü§îReally kind of a meh day. if you were patient and waited for a good entry this morning you are probably did okay.

Last few days we have seen a small dip and then rip during power hour. I like to say don't fight the trend... however it appears today we saw a flip in that trend. We did not see the crazy after hours pop. 

SPY:

todays over all while kinda a sideways day but bullish. we tested and are held above the daily 100 ema of 454 which is extremely bullish.

we currently are looking at a daily MACD buy signal. 
https://i.imgur.com/JMgvwjr.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/liLJR8J.jpeg

resistance wise we are looking at heavy heavy resistance at 458. We need to be able to breach that before we can see 460. 

The close above 454 was a possible indication we are going to continue this short term bullish movement. However, after hours Meta (fb) just posted a massive miss (im assuming havent looked at report myself) but they are down an incredible 19% which im sure you can imagine is bringing QQQ and SPY down a significant amount. 

Prior to meta missing and dragging down SPY which broke our support line and currently has this down 0.7% after hours and clingly to dear life above the daily 100 ema of 454.... i would have suspected that tomorrow we would get a test of that 459.5 resistance however it looks like this bad news from meta just might be enough to kill the short term momentum. 

As always do not fight the trend. We need to be careful to keep what we want separate from what its doing. I dont hold positions over night anymore especially during times like these. 

We need to see how after hours and pre market sort out but tomorrow we may see the inverse of today which would be a small pop in morning followed by sell off. This very well could be confirming the dead cat bounce. We need to see how tomorrow shakes out but even without a 459 resistance test this could start its next phase of dip. 
An important level i will be watching on the daily is the 5 ema  sitting at 449.6... a break below this would confirm the downside in my opinion. The 5 ema likes to act as support or resistance depending on the trend. Tomorrow everyone needs to be careful if you are bullish that we dont miss the top of the dead cat and if you are bearish that you dont let an over reaction of the market to meta give you false bias. 

Note- post is fluid as meta continues to change after market levels.

QQQ:
We tested and held above the daily 200 ema of 363.5 (low of day was 364 though). This overall is bullish. 

we currently are looking at a daily MACD buy signal. 

Support to watch for tomorrow (updating this real time as im watching meta effect the market negatively). We need to stay above 363.4 which is the daily 200 EMA. However, we just dipped nearly 2% after hours and broke that like nothing. 

While we did break a major resistance yesterday today has some worrisome bearish signals we need to take seriously. Yesterday we very nearly avoided closing a bearish red hanging man candle but the power hour pump saved us. Today we closed the red bearish hanging man candle... this can be a signal of a reversal. We very well may continue to see downside tomorrow and the rest of the week. 

A key level to watch is the daily 5 ema of 361.3 this is the last support that keeps me believing we are short term bullish. Once that breaks i think its time to flip back to puts. 
https://i.imgur.com/gFC6fXQ.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/uDZigUO.jpeg

Okay so wtf do we do tomorrow? 

Well a couple of things to keep in kind. 

After hour trading is lower volume and can be way more extreme. We should expect in the morning to give some of these losses back as people buy the dip. 

Today may be the inverse of what tomorrow brings. Id look for some sort of significant retest of those major supports (SPY 454 and QQQ 366). Look for the rejection to confirm this during market hours. I think a rejection may be your sign to be bearish.

The market was in a clear correction 2 weeks ago and was in my opinion saved by the tech earnings posted last week. Many of us had even said how looking at last friday it felt artificially run up and didnt make sense to not be dipping. 

Do not fight the trend. Let the chart tell you where its going. Dont over analyze or look for something thats not there. (Still working on this myself).

Also it appears some of that wild volatility we saw over the last weeks is gone. Entry points and exit points are more crucial now. If your trade goes against you it may not come back later in the day like we saw it do 2 weeks ago. Same if you get the right movement maybe its time to take profits early. Dont be greedy. 

And for my critics who will say dIdNt YoU jUsT sAy AtH? No i didnt. I posed a question to get people to think. And had the market continued its momentum from monday and Tuesday to today and had META beat earnings them being up 19% vs down 19% changes the dynamics. We need to take this market day by day. I highly recommend closing any intraday/ swing positions over night as anything can happen over night. 

One last minor thing im seeing is that bit*coin failed to break its 4 month old resistance line.... 

Overall i need to see how tomorrow plays out but it may be time to get back into puts.... we just may see the next leg down starting right now. Amazon friday may be the only thing that saves this bigger dip from happening... or accelerates it.",0
"Interactive Brokers just increased margin requirements for holding $TSLALooks like a lot of you dummies got margin called. Full letter below:

Margin Increase - Tesla Inc.
 
 
Dear Client,

In light of the current trading environment, IBKR will be increasing the margin requirement for all Tesla Inc. (TSLA) products (Stock, Equity Options, Futures and CFDs).  The first in a series of margin increasing steps is scheduled for May 29, 2019.   

Trading accounts holding Stocks, Equity Options, Futures and CFDs should expect the margin requirement to increase to a minimum of 40%, up from its current level of 30%. Please note that in risk-based accounts other house margin charges may increase the margin requirement above the 10% indication. The increases will be implemented in a series of gradual steps over a 10-day period in order to allow traders to adjust their portfolios and/or capital positions accordingly.  As such, traders should plan on the minimum margin to increase 1% every day, starting after the US close on Wednesday, May 29, 2019, and concluding after the US close on Friday, June 7, 2019. 

As the effect of this change is portfolio-dependent, we strongly recommend that you review the impact of this change before its full implementation on Friday June 7, 2019, and arrange to have sufficient excess financial capacity to absorb the expected margin increases and take action, if necessary, to ensure margin compliance throughout the implementation period in order to avoid liquidations  

To evaluate the impact of this change on your portfolio, please utilize IBKR's Risk NavigatorSM to understand how margin will change based upon the current holdings in your portfolio, as well as to determine the margin requirement for any portfolio that you may elect to construct/test. To evaluate the impact of this proposed change on your margin requirements, please see KB2957 and, from the margin mode setting, select ""TSLA Margin 20190607"".

Consistent with our stated policy, an account that is unable to carry the positions under these new margin requirements will be subject to liquidation in order to bring the account into margin compliance.",0

"Some basic TSLA Tech Analysis for you Smooth-Brained ApesSo, TSLA, along w/ the rest of the Tech stocks is on a downward trajectory, which leads to the obvious question: When does it stop so I can buy in and maximize my upside potential?

I took a look at some historical Moving Averages to get an idea of how far this may go and my initial conclusions are below:

1. Crashed through the 50-day SMA on 21 Feb and has stayed &gt;10% below since.  This MA has historically been TSLA's support level and staying below leads me to think it may be here a while.
2. 100-day SMA is the next logical support level, which is $625 so I'll be watching closely to see if the downward trajectory continues at the same rate, or starts to level out as it approaches that 100-day SMA support level.

The stock is at $688 now so that 100-day SMA isn't really far off and it could rebound sharply so set your alerts and/or limits, raid your wife's boyfriend's wallet, and hang on for a fun, and potentially lucrative opportunity.

Pepperidge farm remembers‚Ä¶. The morning trend was one of the nicest bear trends I have seen since January, unfortunately it did not turn out well for those of us who were bearish today.

When we zoom out the one thing I am seeing is  a very clear peak back on March 29th and we have failed to make a new high four days in a row now and at the same time have made a new low each day. While we just had a massive 2 weeks of bull run it is too soon still to tell if we are in a new bear channel but currently there is quite the case to make that we are starting our new leg down. It just is not as aggressive as we saw back in January. 

Today we broke below one of the major support ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of 450.5 We traded underneath it for quite a while too before we finally saw a true end of day reversal and finished between two levels. We are currently between the 450 and 456 levels but we are also trading within a downward channel that was established when we peaked on March 29th. 

This downward channel gives us a support of 447 and 454. Intraday there was a very heavy indication that we were going to see a bigger dip today and possibly see 445, however, around 115pm the bears managed to turn arguably one of the clearest bear channels ive ever seen with not a single candle or even candle body closed about the 15min 8ema from 845am until 130pm. That is a very strong trend that I am still beyond impressed that the bulls were able to true reverse which used to be rare, but is becoming uncomfortably more common. 

https://preview.redd.it/n19rl078o0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31df256ba1c279467564fc5b831bf22d42f3b51b

Will need to see how ES opens Sunday night and how pre-market looks Monday morning but that afternoon run up seems to have heated up the RSI and we now have a MACD sell signal. The last candle of the day was also very impressive by the fact that we once again had massive sell pressure and downward momentum along with the VIX trending back up steadily only for it to slam the breaks on and do a 180 about face and elevator up. 

https://preview.redd.it/myjm8539o0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6e542f3729ac5d3488f1c9da09024b2c9e676ac

Looking at the VIX it seemed any time we neared 21 we would about face. It is the same with VIX at 19 it doesn‚Äôt seem to want to break below it. 

The VIX is now trending for the last 4 days between 18.9 and 20.6 as its key ‚Äúsupport‚Äù and key ‚Äúresistance‚Äù areas. Mind you VIX doesn‚Äôt really have those but its just the levels the VIX seems to bounce between. Historically over the last year 16 to 21.6 has been the happy range that VIX bounces between. As I had mentioned earlier in the week the VIX is what we need to be trading currently as the VIX has been the only hints to these end of day sell offs. It will be very interesting to see next week where we head. 

Looking at Apple it actually showed arguably more weakness initially then SPY did. Apple pre-market levels were much lower then SPY. However, Apple was able to find support near 172 intraday and seemed to like trading around the 172.8 to 173.5 level most of the day before the end of day pop. 

As you can see by the chart next to VIX, Apple too is in a massive downward trend where it is seeing lower highs and lower lows each day now since March 30th. 

I wanna touch on Apples daily chart first and then we will get into SPY daily and weekly chart and start seeing some key levels headed into next week!

https://preview.redd.it/httmjjzao0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7376495d302a315872a057f1c6bfef180db14ccb

Apple has by all means topped out and peaked. The most recent high of 179.61 on March 30th which also happened to be its first red day in 12 days by all means looks like it could see the next leg down. 

Apple today broke its bullish channel that was established two weeks ago on the start of its run up. To me that is something to watch going into next week for sure. Apple also flirted with its daily 8ema of 173.72 for a long part of the day and for most of the day it was resistance before the end of day fat green candle gapped it up over the 8ema to close what really was a bearish day to appear bullish. 

The red channel is now void (left it on there for visualization) and the grey is what ia m watching as in play now. The support line of it is VERY strong with three points but the upper is still being tested. I will be watching Apple if the bull momentum is still there to pop to a peak of 179.2 next week. However, what I really will be anticipating based off the RSI and the MACD on the daily I fully expect a retrace to test at minimum support of the daily 20 ema at 169.58. We very well could see a dip as low as the daily 100ema at 164.71 before it finds some real support. This bullrun of Apple was impressive but very unnatural pattern wise. 

Today also is the first time since March 17th that a candle has broken below the 8ma. Intraday and later this week I had seen quite a bit of weakness from Apple.

https://preview.redd.it/xb80vjgco0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d759271b509ef2466f8a1576c2a5a3eaac644388

Now taking a look at SPY. Today we too saw a very similar (not surprised) move of Apple breaking its current two week bull run channel to the downside. The grey channel is now null and we will look to see if SPY can find some downside next week or not. Today was the first time since March 16th that  SPY was able to get a candle wic below the daily 8ema support line.

Thursday and today were the first time in two weeks that SPY actually looked ‚Äúweak.‚Äù I still do not know how they managed to get this green end of day today but I did not have the strength it once had. 

The RSI is at 57 on the daily and the MACD is well above the zero line and ready to cross over to sell for the first time since March 15th. But this would be the first cross over to sell above the signal line since January 5th which we all know what happened after that‚Ä¶

The daily 8ema of SPY actually acted as support and resistance all day with a majority of it acting as resistance. I was fairly confident we would at minimum see a candle body below the 8ema but the MM had other plans. However, there is a very good chance that we see further downside. In general when spy breaks a wick over a major support/ resistance such as the 8ema, 20ema, 100ema, or 200 ema the next candle or shortly after will be below it. The daily chart finally looks bearish to me. 

Intraday had we been able to keep the bearish momentum up I fully believe we would have seen 444-446 range which is the Daily 100 (446.42), daily 20 (445.62), Daily 50 (444.42) and then lastly the daily 200 ema is all the way down at 439.46). 

Target wise for next week IF the bull momentum continues we will look to establish the next resistance point of the orange channel which would be around a max of 460 for Monday. I also have a resistance line from the March 29th/ 30th tops which I will be watching at the 458 level if Monday ends up being bullish. 

If the bears are able to get the momentum going (and sustain it‚Ä¶ they have had the momentum realistically a few times these last two weeks but the bulls have refused to let them capitalize on it) I will look for that 444-446 range Monday. We have not see a -2% day in almost a month with the reddest day being a very moderate -1.3% back on March 11th. While I would never play it position wise we are ‚Äúdue‚Äù in my opinion for a fairly bearish day.  Though with the vix now trending down in the 20s we may not get these massively green or red days we grew so accustom to. In the last two weeks the average close +/-  has been 0.75 to 1.25%. The only real massive volatility I have seen in the last two weeks was on Thursday during power hour where we dipped 1.4% total. 

&amp;#x200B;

Taking a look at the weekly chart for SPY now shows a bit of a different story compared to the daily. We are actually still within the bullish grey channel established back the week of March 7th. This channel gives the weekly range of a high of 480 (yes that‚Äôs ATH) and a low of 450‚Ä¶ if we are obeying the channel. 450 is interesting to me because that acutually is right around the lows of today intraday with us reaching almost 449 for a short period of time. 

Weekly volume wise we did see an increase from last week with volume coming in total around 445.5 mil. This is still slightly below the previous 2 months average but about 70mil higher than last week.

The weekly actually shows a much better downward channel in my opinion then the daily does. The orange channel would give us a high of 460 for the week and a mid channel point of 431 with the current bottom of the channel being down near 404 which is also the weekly 100 EMA. 

The one thing I am watching VERY closely on this weekly chart is how the candle finished. IT finished in a gravestone doji candle. Which is actually a very bearish indicator. Now while its not perfect and could be nothing I look back at the weekly and almost everytime we have seen a doji candle formed on the weekly (week of Feb 28th, Jan 10th, Nov 15th) we have seen downside the next week. The gravestone doji make it even more of a bearish omen. However, the one bullish thing I am seeing on the weekly is the MACD. That macd is sitting on the zero line and looks poised to cross over to a buy. Of course a MACD that‚Äôs near crossing can false cross, or can kiss but never truly cross so it should be taken with a grain of salt. 

Overall I really believe in a bearish week coming up. 

https://preview.redd.it/3tiypiufo0r81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd2af2a57a48ac76ca61278c226f9a7d60c77af1

With the 10year and 2 year (-0.06) officially closed inverted and the 3yr and 5yr inverting last week We are seeing the signs of an impending recession. While the market seems to have over the last two weeks shrugged off anything and everything inflation or economy related I think its only a matter of time before they finally start to realize how bad things are and start their panic. 

Next week economic and fed wise we have the FOMC minutes on Wednesday at 2pm, jobless claims on Thursday along with consumer credit. 

While not a big news or data week we have the looming CPI coming out on April 12 which is less than two weeks away and I suspect it to become a talking point again soon. With gas prices and inflation they way they are I suspect the number is going to be much worse than expected and we will see a the markets begin to react and price things in.

10% challenge-

&amp;#x200B;

I started the week off on a big L due to greed and a trend reversal. I was lucky enough to have a great 3 days of trading which put me well above my weekly profit goal so I went very heavy wisk on today. I failed to secure some profits that I definitely should have as I truly believed in the bear trend today and was fully expecting the next big move down. However, it just never came. After taking profits well before the massive sell off Thursday with no buying power left I decided despite being up nearly 50% at one point on positions to hold and not take profits as I believe like SPY used to that we would see a small retrace before breaking the intraday low. I did not think the bulls would actually end today green like they did. 

With that being said lets take a look at me weekly progress and monthly being that the month is now over.

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly profit goal- $2500

Actual profit- $3200

&amp;#x200B;

Average % gains per trade= 3%

&amp;#x200B;

Weekly win rate- 68%

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly profit goal- $10,000

Actual profit- $6,700 (just shy of my goal‚Ä¶ which looking back is very good considering I spent the first 2 weeks of the month establishing a new part of my strategy and learning a new indicator) 

Looking back it does hurt knowing had I not gotten greedy Monday and had I not gone full risk on today I would have succeeded my monthly goal. But sometimes we do have to risk some to see bigger profits. In moderation and not blowing up an account it can be worth while. But in the end profits will always be king

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly win rate- 63%

Since we closed green today with all the bullshit going on, go ahead and mark us down for a new ATH tomorrow and potentially 303 by Friday close. Trump will probably get bored over the weekend, and tweet threatening shit to Persia on Saturday and enact more tariffs on Sunday. 

That being said, I'm thinking we go calls the rest of the week and then unload right before close. Buy puts when they're cheap as fuck Friday, hold them over the weekend and let trump do what trump does best, and then make a fucking killing on Monday. 

This might be the most foolproof DD I've ever had. I know there's not a lot to show for it, but I've had Trump's tweet notifications on for 4 years now. I know his tweet patterns. We're very close to another tweet storm.

"8-5-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple weekly recap and analysisWell just when you think the bears are finally going to catch a break‚Ä¶ the bulls pull the biggest PSYCH of the year. Today was even more impressively frustrating as from 11am until 1145am on SPY and from 11am until noon and 2pm until 245pm on VOLSPD the bears had locked in what we call extreme momentum. This was the first extreme bear momentum I have seen in weeks. Usually once a level of extreme momentum like this is locked in it takes a big move to get that momentum to break, however, the bulls both times broke that momentum and 180‚Äôd this. 

The dips are still call buying opportunities‚Ä¶ the MM are just getting better and better at selling these red days and trapping the bears. 

So a few very interesting things to note that has changed from last night around 7pm until now‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/ptq8o70xwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4e4286a69147842e5d8949343ff3d95063e27bc

Last night markets had price in an 87% chance of a 50bps hike for the September meeting after this mornings employment numbers the market now is nearly 50/50 whether it‚Äôs a 50bps or 75bps hike. Was that unbelievable drop pre market the market pricing it in already? Or does that still need to be priced in? Will markets not care until CPI Wednesday? So there is this too which is interesting‚Ä¶

I took this picture last night of the expected CPI when I was making my CPI post‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/zydhdxlxwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30745cfa02d835c76a22ff01aa3e31c498596d33

Check out the consensus‚Ä¶ they actually today (at some point) lowered the expected CPI consensus by 0.2%. I find this very odd and suspicious to say the least that they lowered the expected CPI consensus so close to CPI. 

I have two theories on todays actions‚Ä¶ 1. The employment numbers clearly caught the MM and markets as a whole by a big surprise‚Ä¶ I mean this opening was more red then GDP confirming a recession and gave CPI a run for its money. I believe todays action (especially looking at things like IV rank) shows the MM had today already priced in as a bullish day. It would explain a lot of what happened intraday today. 2. The markets/ feds (whoever you think is in control) realized that with a huge employment number like this with an expected terrible CPI (forecast is 9.1%) markets are panicking. They are doing everything they can to keep this market from crashing into the abyss. 

Think about it whats really driving this current bear market rally? Overall after the last CPI and last FOMC markets are pretty much under the impression that the feds about to pivot in September. This is why the GDP/ recession and last CPI is being shrugged off and why you don‚Äôt hear the ‚Äúpanic‚Äù talk much anymore about the next rate hike, cpi, etc. etc. However, today was the first time the markets really said wow with numbers like this feds aren‚Äôt going to pivot and the rate hikes aren‚Äôt done yet. Markets are late to react (usually one day) to new like this and I believe we could see that reaction Monday and Tuesday. We have CPI on Wednesday and I think that‚Äôs going to be a big deal‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g2mc6ycywzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b6466782329e218a5e09fcd45571d7245ee4b7d

https://preview.redd.it/jkg80wuywzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c91d2a367dad95368274183905eb77d9b8635d01

I am still working off the impression that we are consolidating like we did from May 27th until June 8th before the CPI dump. If this is true then Monday (Tuesday at the latest) should start a pretty impressive and aggressive sell off. 

This last week has also set up a pretty large symmetrical breakout/ down (red lines) triangle that will most likely play out Monday if not Tuesday at the latest. Key support is 410.3 (which breaks the overall 8 week long bull channel) and resistance is 413.9. 

We are still stuck right between the daily 100ema and daily 200ema and we need to pretty much wait for one of this to hard break before we can finally see if we are going to 430 or 390s. 

It is important to note that we have not put in a new high since Wednesday so we are starting a lower high trend. If we once again reject that red solid resistance line at 413.9 Monday then I would feel more confident that we are going to drop next week. 

Key levels to watch next week remain the 100ema at 407.5 and the 200ema at 417.4. Overall nothing is happening until one of those is broken. 

https://preview.redd.it/728od8hzwzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b061604c029e31bee552aafa1e8365e17f4268a

The ES futures daily chart is looking similar yet a little different. I said yesterday ‚Äúwe are here‚Äù referring to the June 27th/ 28th candles and had we not had that ridiculous bull run at open and had we crashed down EOD like was expected we would have finished nearly identical to those days. However, we put in yet another doji on the daily. 

The bulls were able to reconfirm bull channel support tho at open and still haven‚Äôt broken that 8 week long support line. 

We here too are stuck between the daily 100ema at 4085 and daily 200ema at 4184.

The symmetrical triangle in play here too shows support at 4115 (which breaks bull channel) and resistance at 4158 (key resistance for the last 3 days) for Monday. 

Futures did finally break that extreme bull momentum support line that I mentioned I suspected would happen today since SPY broke its yesterday. 

https://preview.redd.it/hye8ee40xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=141e25ae9398701552d16d5f5147c6812d46a156

Overall the weekly SPY and ES futures charts are looking very similar. I am highlighting the May 31st weekly candle here on both SPY and ES. I am looking for a similar pattern to play out next week. This week we attempted to break out of this 415/ 4162 weekly level resistance. We tested this resistance numerous times this week, however, we failed to close over this key weekly resistance every day this week. 

I am also seeing that this May 31st weekly candle is the week before June CPI. Which also plays further into line of expectations that Monday and Tuesday is going to lead to a big sell off going into CPI on Wednesday. This would now be the 5th weekly candle to attempt to and fail to break this 415/4162 level. 

We may open Monday red and just drill all week but I suspect Monday we test this level one more time. A rejection here should result in further downside. 

Key support for the now 8 week (9 week starting next week) bull channel is 409.1/ 4100. If and when that support is finally blown through I suspect a large selloff fuel by CPI. 

If you read my CPI document you know I expect blood next week. Whether we get that or not? Well that‚Äôs a different story. The bulls are still beyond in control its not funny. At every possible weak breaking point they manage to muster together some unexpected strength. 

https://preview.redd.it/4t2usgf1xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc505d116a451d151fb27186fa0cad8e5091b236

Apples daily chart is still looking hella bullish with them too refusing to give up any of this relentless bull momentum. However, like SPY yesterday Apple broke the week long extreme bull momentum support line. That‚Äôs the first strike the next strike is going to be breaking that bull bull channel support line. 

Now despite the bull strength today the daily chart is still looking like we are putting in a teepee (the opposite of a v bottom) top. With the big run up, a doji and now a lower candle I suspect this COULD be the start to the top. 

I will be watching closely Monday for this blue support line at 159.8 and the red resistance line at 164.6. Apple has been even putting in large green days or small +/- 0.5% days for the last 8 weeks (minus maybe 2 bigger red days). Overall its going to take some pretty big news to put apple in the ground (it did open down 1.6% today which was a good start‚Ä¶). 

The trend as you can see is Apple puts in a high then has about 2-3 days of small drops before it puts in a massive green day. If this trend continues we should see a small retrace before Tuesday is big green, however, if markets can break this trend and we break that key 159.8 blue bull support line we might finally fill that gap. 

https://preview.redd.it/rpesu332xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b1d4facffa650e00ac2f1d7a09089f16d12a379

There really isn‚Äôt a whole lot to be said about apples weekly besides this 8 week channel is hella impressive. This is actually Apples first 5 green weeks in a row since October 2021. It is also the most impressive bull run Apple has had since Covid recovery‚Ä¶

Weekly support is 160.8 and resistance is 172. 

https://preview.redd.it/nw96b3r2xzf91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ef5eea1d6576506e48903ed7c5214ac9ad09634

The VIX continues to impressively unwind. This week with CPI we are either going to see the VIX finally go back to 30 or we are about to see the VIX go back to 15. 

10% challenge-

Overall this was actually a great week for me. I had a good time getting back to me taking these quick scalps. 

The biggest L this week came on Wednesday when I let a put run to -73% and refused to close it at -30% when it felt like it wasn‚Äôt coming back and then not closing it at -50%. I held onto this loser WAY too long (I didn‚Äôt accept how strong the bull momentum was at the time) and that turned a GREAT week into a red week. Overall I am happy with how my week went, the play I made and my win rate. Had I cut this loser it would have changed my week from red to green. I continue at times to take losses fast enough. 

Today was a good day with 3 nice scalps. My only regret was that 1dte put. I took it before the mid day reversal (when momentum was at the bear extreme) I hit about 10% profits, however, my conviction based on what I saw was so high I didn‚Äôt take profits as I suspect we would see a retest of 409‚Ä¶ as you can see how the day went that did not pan out very well for me‚Ä¶ I was unsure whether to let this ride to Monday or not. I would need a 409 breakeven Monday in order to see green. 

I weighed the risk to reward on this on whether It would be better to salvage this and use the money Monday or whether I thought we would open and drill right to 409 to make it worth holding. In the end I chose to mitigate the loss. This was another good lesson for me that no matter how strong my conviction is and no matter what im seeing and how good it looks and how strongly everyone else also sees what I see‚Ä¶ always protect profits. 

In the end I had a great week and felt like myself again this week for the first time in a while. I look forward to next week. 

Remember to always have a plan, protect profits, and never get greedy. This market is chewing up and spitting anyone out who remotely get greedy or who thinks they are smarter than the MM is. Overall, protect your profits and protect your portfolio‚Ä¶ there are better times ahead of us. 

Have a great weekend guys!

"a page from my personal playbook - SPY 11/11/22SPY 11/11

MACRO:

* 5yr inflation expectations at 10am tomorrow should be another dot on the rate hike prediction line.  if its bad it could easily be ignored, although it shouldn't be; fed won't. if its good it could add to the euphoria and with good reason.
* data could influence -1% to +2% on the day

TECHNICAL:

* flat to +1% open
* be wary of spx 4000 resistance
* big gap up and sexy data could break 400 early, enabling another 4%+ day of big fomo + scared shorts.  in this case we probably have a F.R.I. (fools rush in) Day scenario. i could see this shit hit 412, wouldn't be weirder than anything else recently
* if we're green/flat all day, power hour is heavily in play and could start as early as 2:35, rising quite possibly into highs at close. %change from open could double

PLAYS:

1. afk AM play: buy 11/14 atm spy call before 9:32. limit order buy for -10% open price, if its still open at 9:31:5X, market in.  sell limit 1.5x.  ditch at noonish (+/- 10 min).  
2. longshot fomo insurance: buy the best 0day spx call u can for .10 before 10:00
3. quickest trade: 9:50-10:04:59. double or ditch a 0day call.  i expect prices to run up 10 minutes prior to the michigan release, then potential instant volatility + momentum.  also not much iv crush risk for a few minutes.  possible very safe low return scalp would be to ditch the call before 10, or even stop loss it.
4. safest conditional play: if we gap up and data is favorable, watch how the S&amp;P 500 breaches 4000.  if its clean, buy calls as spy hits 399.90.  stop loss at 200% or greed all day
5. power hour (if in play): buy calls 2:35ish. if its a 0day, 2x seems conservative.  aside from that, good luck out there soldier.  longer dated, holding as close to close as you can is valid.  stop losses are valid too.  if you feel comfortable setting a limit based on the specifics of the option, go get it. 

\-----------

i now have a page in my playbook. thank you, i work better with the accountability that you, my analytical peers, will surely offer in the form of links to fast food employment opportunities.

personally, i'm super conservative right now so i'm probably gonna skip play 1, and maybe 5 depending on how i'm feeling

Shares outstanding are 3.16B, that‚Äôs with a B, billion.

Additionally, it has a higher market cap then the majority of top auto manufacturers combined.

""We're going on a trip in our favorite rocket ship"" -Warren Buffet, when asked about calls on SPY at this time

Buffet took one hard look at this here chart and he shit himself from this opportunity.

This chart shows that the SPY has been consolidating for a while around the war zone of 280. But I'm here to tell you, that we're going to the moon.

By drawing a line from previous highs to our current location. And another pretty line from the December lows to today, we see an interesting formation. Lets call it a wedge. 

*drum roll*

But also on this chart, we see the 50 day moving average is about to cross above the 200 day moving average, which translates to free tendies.

Musk - considering taking tsla Private at $420,1
"$TSLA to Mars - Part 2Okay, so I said a lot of [horse shit yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/95t2hm/tsla_to_mars_dd_inside/), but I didn't cover a few key points.

Let's talk about financing. How the fuck is Musk going to pay for the buyout? How is funding secured? He's gonna pay for it. That's fucking right. Let's take a look at shareholder's options:

1. Sell your shares to Tesla for [$420](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/242/293/d49.jpg).

2. Hang on and get private TSLA stock.

3. Sell to the shorts for *motherfucking dump trucks worth of money*.

Obviously shareholders aren't going to choose option 1 except for those Ally account motherfuckers. So he'll take *a little* money from the shorts to cover those assholes. More importantly, let's talk about how he prevents option 3.

**Disclaimer- I have no fucking clue if this next part is even legal. But, [get in loser. We're committing securities fraud.](https://i.redd.it/7jroz9aeire11.jpg)) **

Once TSLA goes private, only people who previously held stock will be able to buy or sell. And, if you want to buy, it has to be as a ratio of what you currently hold. Sold all your shares to shorts? Fuck off, bucko. Enjoy your dirty scab money. Sold all *but one* share to shorts? Welcome to the club buddy, but you'll never hold a sizable number of shares. Once you're in though, you'll get some fucking sweet perks. Discounted Teslas? Free supercharging for life? Early access to order new models? You bet your fucking ass.

With that taken care of, shareholders are eager to join the club with as many tickets as possible, and shorts won't be able to buy stock from anyone but *motherfucking Elon Musk*. That's when the $11,000/share play happens. Right now, there's [fucking 35M shares short sold](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest). Let's say the shorts get off easy, and *only* need to sell half of those shares to Papa Musk/TSLA. *That's fucking $192.5B.* Musk, being the generous type, splits it between Tesla and SpaceX. Boom, bitches. TSLA buys out every other car manufacturer in the world, forces them to only make electric cars, and we're all taking vacations *to fucking Mars on a BFR*. That's right, Papa Musk is *literally taking us to Mars* with this play. And the share holders who own that private TSLA stock get first dibs with *premium space-cabins*.

In summary, fucking buy as many shares as you can and [get your ass to Mars](https://i.imgur.com/nhMp8Dm.jpg).

"My calls/TA for upcoming price action for SPYDue to the bearish divergences on all timeframes tracking back all the way to Jan if you look back far enough i feel like this was a long time coming. But due to the state of play elsewhere in the world we were melting upwards. There needed to be a catalyst either way for the market to definitively pick a direction, i fear we may have found it, and it says down. 

Now i fully expect that since i‚Äôm making this post therefor jinxing myself and mr. market will hear me and do the opposite. But fuck it. 

I called the hourly H&amp;S reversal a couple days ago and here are my price targets:

Best possible scenarios for the bulls: 

we stop right about here on the short term trend line/50 period moving average on the daily and reverse and back to our regular scheduled programing. That would be around a 3% decline from the highs of this week. 

Most likely/neutral scenario: 

we mill around a bit at this price level ultimately breaking the short term trend line/relative support around $291.50 - $290.50 and then ultimately my price target would be somewhere around the low of the May dip @ $275ish give or take. But keep in mind that it looks like that would be creating the head of a much larger H&amp;S pattern if we bounce back up from there. The H&amp;S pattern would be negated if we reach back up to the $301 price level, and if that happens my price target is around $304. If this plays out it‚Äôs be a 8-9% decline from the highs. 

Best case for the bears scenario: 

we break through the major support at $275ish and then my next price target would be around the $250 price range. Keep in mind this is still a relatively bullish analysis as some chartists are calling for a ~30% drop. I‚Äôm not sold on this being it though. If we do hit that long term trend line at around $250 and it holds expect us to rip to new highs by EOY. If it breaks, buy gold, run for cover and try not to check your portfolio. If this plays out and trend line holds it‚Äôd be about a 15% decline from the highs. 

As i got rekt on AMZN and AMD earnings i‚Äôm really just holding onto the seat of my pants with a couple OTM puts and a fat silver play but these are my price targets.",0

"Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and holdEvery other comment right now is a shill lamenting the stupidity of everyone who‚Äôs still holding or how sad it is the big guy won again or some other gloomy horseshit. 

To all of you who are out there who‚Äôve ever thought ‚Äúoh man, if I‚Äôd only bought X stock X years ago I‚Äôd be rich!‚Äù - if you aren‚Äôt holding right now, you‚Äôre wrong. 

I‚Äôm an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn‚Äôt sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I‚Äôm holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it‚Äôs too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin‚Äôs mistake? No actual hedging. Don‚Äôt be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won‚Äôt help if you‚Äôre making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I‚Äôve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don‚Äôt give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren‚Äôt the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It‚Äôs not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we‚Äôre in dire straits probably didn‚Äôt comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold.

"Puts on AAPL and here's whyI'm betting AAPL will go down over 50% by August but I could see it being down 25% by May. Reason? Because China will be attacking Taiwan in the upcoming weeks/ months I think they will have a different approach to attacking them then Russia has when attacking Ukraine. I think while military invasion will probably still happen I think it will be more of a relentless amount of cyber attacks that will devastate the little island nation causing there production to cease all together for a few weeks minimum. 

AAPL heavily realize on there exports to make there phones this should cripple there stock and tesla may also get hurt as well along with Intel. 

We are looking at a most likely non nuclear ww3 folks I mean it's not out of the question for a few nukes to be exchanged here and there but the three main ways of battle will be fake information campaigns, hacking and drone strikes/missle strikes. There will of course still be ground force battles and aquatic battles but when it comes to China they r extremely strategic more so then Putin is thats nor to say he isn't smart because he is but he's more of a brute force kind of dude.",0

"Stock splits: buy TSLA, GOOGL, or AMZN?I‚Äôm curious what you all think would be the best investment if you had to choose one of these to buy before they split.

My (basic bitch) stances-

TSLA: based on last split and rabid fan base I see this one rising more aggressively than the others post split

GOOGL: this would be my top pick. it may not go back up as quickly as TSLA but retail could jump in once entry level price is lower

AMZN: this would be my last choice based solely on how they treat their employees however I heard on this mornings WSB call that their anti-union stance could actually bring government money in, so from a purely financial standpoint could be a good investing opportunity

"ES Futures and SPY analysis - 6/5/19Quite a crazy move yesterday and overnight as SPY pushed above the resistance of the bearish channel. As it stands right now, we don't have confirmation to go bullish or bearish confidently at this point as we are now consolidating from yesterday's move.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, that being said, the bearish move is possibly over thus a new target is set. At this point, the target is 2870-2983 over the next few weeks. We will need to hold 2800 support before we get a move to attempt that level.

"Tariffs effect on AMZNWalmart and other retailers have said multiple times that the tariffs will end up increasing the price for consumers, which I believe will ultimately decrease their stock prices at least in the coming weeks. 

Contradicting, Cramer and few more analysts have said the blow that customers face will be negligible as these retailers will end up choosing different countries in their supply chain. 

Amazon sellers will also face a blow since most import materials from China, and will face impact accordingly. But what I am not able to understand, is how badly, if so, amazon will be affected by this. (Considering they are more than a standard retailer, with ventures outside such as cloud, electronics, streaming) 

Also, I was wondering if anyone could help me out in understanding how commodities will be affected by this, given US is a big importer of soybean/pork/etc from China. How will this affect other countries in commodity trades. 

Lastly, snap has to go down right with this new executive order for fb/twitter/etc

"$TSLA, $AAPL, and $AMZN have yet to revisit their bear market lows, while the S&amp;P 500 and QQQ already have. Will these stocks follow the rest of the market?Fundamentals aside, what do $TSLA, $AAPL, and $AMZN stocks have in common? 

Three things:

1. **They have yet to revisit their bear market lows** (they‚Äôre stronger than most of the market).
2. **They put in the first inkling of bullish market structure** (they experienced significant bounces and are trying for a higher low)
3. **Their social activity is growing substantially** (people are showing interest in these stocks. They‚Äôre talking about them across social and news &amp; posts about them are trending)

Let's look at these 3 things in chart format:

**Tesla $TSLA:**

[$TSLA Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/qa3ufmmv8op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=365e7f85b98c892e7b3f7006c7a4454d45f50977)

&amp;#x200B;

**Apple $AAPL:**

[$AAPL Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/u4sneh529op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9dfc715f237aeea7fa8e70d0d431136c9506414)

&amp;#x200B;

**Amazon $AMZN:**

[$AMZN Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/6xuy4lc89op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c042709e68a346a119200ae6a487f50abb62a1)

As you can see, these stocks have noticeably increased social activity that appears to be trending up in the last 2-3 months.

Now, what about stocks that have already revisited their bear market lows? Let‚Äôs take a look at a couple of popular stock picks that have performed poorly price-wise and spot the differences:

**NVIDIA $NVDA:**

[$NVDA Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/l8dhcjzg9op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e30185a23cb56a6e87bb09bd5d9675f45c6d52)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Adobe $ADBE:**

[$ADBE Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/ahfsazxi9op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b5e6446f2d5ea7aef2dd8def6348a41575a406b)

While $NVDA and $ADBE experienced recent spikes in social activity, they do not show the same kind of sustained growth in activity (continuous interest from people) as many of the better-performing stocks. 

Therefore, in times like these when the macro environment and markets are bearish, it‚Äôs probably best to keep your eye on stocks with sustainable increases in social activity, rather than the stocks with little growth or growth that fades quickly. 

So, will $TSLA, $AMZN, and $AAPL hold above their bear market lows? Or follow the rest of the market? 

While the social data presented in these charts don't provide the answers, they do provide a different perspective that's interesting to think about.

"(AMD) Quality 10x Stock, Meme PotentialI know regards will hate such a healthy badass stock on WSB, BUT..

AMD (AMD) stock has been loading it's rocket with fuel since Lisa became the CEO in 2014 (especially in the last 3-4 years) and officially surpassed Intel (INTC) in market cap in Feb '22, on top of which having consistently yuge growth in revenue, R&amp;D, profits, market share, etc and consistently beating estimates. Not to mention beginning to surpass Nvidia (NVDA) in several metrics.

Rocket is primed to 10x in the next decade thanks to good fundamentals and not just memevestors. Stock is way down, perfect time to jump on the train, or hold out for possibly a bit lower thanks to poor Nvidia (NVDA) performance dragging this stock down in recent weeks.

Viable candidate for a quality meme stock as well.

"Long MSFT Calls - Price IncreasesI work in the industry and all the buzz the past week has been about MSFT increasing prices starting October 1st. The meat and potatoes of this is that they are screwing over large customers who have what they call ""enteprise agreements"" that give them better discounts and more flexible license options, price locks, deploy now pay later, things like that. They are increasing pricing on specific products anywhere from 10%-30%. This is basically their continued effort to squeeze people in to their pay monthly/yearly per user subscription model because they make more money. As this continues to unfold and large customers who have not yet moved to cloud/subscription model will have their hands forced by Microsoft and basically not have a choice but to do so. MSFT profits are going to soar and we're going to be eating tendies. I do not know how long this will take in terms of seeing it reflected in stock price and revenue, probably a couple of quarters after it is implemented - again October 1st is when the hikes become effective. Maybe some June 2019's $130's if you are feeling froggy. I am going to do something, just not sure what yet. ",0

"Case for TSLA 2030Case for tesla long term:

Its a lot of speculation.  But we have an idea what tesla is targeting.  And we have teslas track record for the past 10 years or so.

20M deliveries by 2030.  Power revenues equal to auto revenues.  Plus robo taxis.  Not to mention anything else like service, superchargers, insurance, possible air craft down the road, etc.

So you can use that, 30% margins on autos, avg selling prices of say $25k. To get auto revenues estimates.  Double that revenue for power.  Then multiple by a probability of success.

Robo taxis are a real outlier that could possibly double both of those or be equal to zero.

So its really difficult to assign value. Which is why the stock is so volatile.

The high price is due to tesla historically high success at hitting 50% CARG since 2012.  Just try carrying forward 30% CARG for 10 years and see what estimates that gives you.

As such market is expecting tesla to do well.  Production is lined up for 1M autos this year to not be an unreasonable number, double of 2020.

Do all the above and assign a price multiple to the revenue.

So teslas track is strong, its history is strong, and its potential is even stronger.


So do the math.  20M autos at 25k sale price yields 500B in revenue.  Double that to include power potential, so $1T in revenue.  30% margins leaves us with 300B in profits (assuming they can get earnings to near equal auto margins, they currently do NOT).  A 20 P/E gives us $6T market cap.  This ignores robo taxis.

So $6000 a share by 2030, assuming no robo taxi revenue, production hit targets, and 20 P/E.  Obviously a lot of risk to these targets though.

Alternatively, 40% CARG (tesla has had 50% since they IPO'd) would put 2030 revenue at $896B.  Not far off from the above.


Big questions are

1) can it hit/maintain 30% margins as EVs race to the bottom on prices/commodize.  Apple has done well with phones but autos may be more difficult, idk

2) can it turn revenue into profits equal to 30% profit margins.  Current earnings are no where near the declared auto profit margins. 

3) can it scale manufacturing fast enough to hit target with batteries being a big limitation, driven by limits in battery supply chains, which they have to take in house and reinvent to achieve 

4) is a 20 P/E reasonable.  If not what is?  Most autos are much less then this.  But most autos have terrible debt positions and near no growth.  

5) biggest what if, can they make robo taxis a global thing?  How will that affect revenue and margins?

May be a good time to BUY THE DIP

# TL;DR

I'm going to live up to my username and put the TL;DR in the beginning for you because I sense your concentration already drifting:  

1. AAPL is important because it is a Colossus (get it?) of the Tech industry.  It will influence other holdings, and we should discuss and prepare.
2. AAPL has held up remarkably through this crash.  Tim Apple is lending out his Apple-Bottom to all of Wall Street is my guess.  **This means Apple has a lot of room to fall like a final sacrifice to the bear God.**  
3. Chip problems from China.  Biden administration is forcing a brain drain out of China and manufactured chips and production are in big fucking trouble. 
4. Stagnant growth and peaked design.  This is gonna upset people, but there really is so many times you can resize a box for a pocket and call it a fresh new product.  The hardware is getting ever so faster, but the innovation is gone. 
5. Flood of existing pre-used products already on the market.  
6. American population is cutting back on expenses, and apple products are so overpriced for what they do. 
7. (Hoping to add more as good points come in)

| 2020-04-30 | 2020-03-31 | $0.52 | $0.64 |

You see, even despite a pandemic, they have always beat or matched their price target.  Covid was a strain on the market because of the forward thinking schizophrenic hive-mind that is traders.  They foresaw massive supply chain disruption and it is definitely here.  It is miraculous that we haven't seen more problems arising from Apple yet.  The new iPhone was announced as being delayed and stock quickly dropped and recovered.  Could this be signs of something yet to come?  Supply-chains are slow to rebuild.  Remember that.  It's been years, and the effects are being felt still.  Which brings me to my next point.

I'll leave most of this discussion to the comments because the severity of what is going on needs to be mulled over. I can't help but think this is catastrophic.  Someone correct me. Please.

The remainder of my points are basically general recession points and Apple really isn't in a great place for a downturn. They sell unaffordable shiny and chrome items as a forefront of technological advancement, and people chase that clout with a fervor of excitement and pay a premium for it.  Well, buying new tech is a hobby. An expensive one.  As the strain tightens, the products already in circulation will be bought and replaced with other products as the collectors dump their phones into the market.  Similar to NVidias video cards when mining with GPU's was made obsolete.  There is a saturated online market for apple products that apple will not see any revenue from.",1

"2/28/22 SPY Pre-market anaylsis (Deja Vu)Well here we go again... we saw futures open a wild 2.8% down on sunday night. Over night futures, however, was able to gather some steam and gather some support and climb from the rubble... 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8j41s9gwvkk81.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a2dab6afd4bdad105b73e44290a9112434e57ea

Here is a chart of futures last night for reference to see how well it climbed from the pits of despair. It actually established quite the beautiful little channel too. The 8 ema crossed above the mid bollinger around midnight and has climbed from their using the 8 ema as support and the mid bollinger as backup support. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qp6z9zmzvkk81.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41e280cbe59d0e020426fc5c7cebfd30115a6e09

As you can see on the current SPY pre-market chart if we looked just at this we would miss the bigger picture and not notice the large upward channel we are in... Besides the random wic on the 8 am candle we can see we are still actually in an upward climb since open... 

For many of us I think we still have a little PTSD from thursday morning where we saw a similar setup, however, way more extreme in how red it was. So what does that mean today...?

1. we can NOT go into this perma bull or perma bear.
2. We can NOT go into this thinking this is the same setup as Thursday
3. we have to let the chart play out and go from there
4. we have to take profits when they are given to us. 

So what does that mean for today? Where are we headed? What are some important things to watch? 

Pre-market we are actually in a range from 429.9 to 434. Today i suspect those to be our ranges too. If we manage to break above 434 we may see another bullish recovery (after all futures is showing this) and if some how break below 429.9 we may see some sort of wildly red day... 

This market can only take so much bad news and so many major sell offs before it inevitably breaks down. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ke56beq0wkk81.png?width=1930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebe0e211454499346372b663f1b925935b9b9351

Here is a reminder of the daily chart and the channels we COULD be currently in. It also shows us that we failed to break back above the 200 EMA (439.48) which overall is a bearish sign. we now have also fallen back below the 8 ema on the daily...which is at what magical resistance number? 434.68... Yup the range limit from pre-market. Thats something that makes me go hmmm. 

This daily chart also shows that 50 ema is sitting PERFECTLY lined up with the grey channel i have been watching since January started... Major Resistance is at 449.5 to confirm the dead cat bounce and inevitably the next leg down.

One other interesting note i did mention on friday analysis was that the daily finished with a hanging man candle... that could signal a reversal of trend. 

Okay so here is some levels to watch for today:

Support- 431.1 --&gt; 429.9 (lower range of pre market) --&gt; 427.7 --&gt; 425.9 

\-0.5%= 435.6

\-1%= 433.4

\-1.5%= 431.2

\-2%= 429

\-2.5%= 426.8

\-3%= 424.6

&amp;#x200B;

Resistance- 433.3 --&gt; 434 (upper range of pre market and daily 8 ema) --&gt; 434.8 (current upper bollinger band) --&gt; 435.6 --&gt; 436.7 --&gt; 437.6 --&gt; (Fridays after hours close)  --&gt; 438.6 (after hours high from friday)

0.5%= 439.9

1%= 442.1

1.5%= 444.3

2%= 446.5

2.5%= 448.6 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately my kids school is closed today so i wont be doing a live like i had planned but i plan to do some trading if they will let me haha. 

My goal is to watch opening hour and see what way we go. See if that 8 ema turns into support or resistance. I will be waiting for a candle to close above or below and then wait for my confirmation candle of support or resistance before i enter a position. I will be taking profits early today too.

For those of you who are ready to go long on some puts its a tough time... because we still have plenty of upside movement to go (448/449) to the top before i would consider going long on puts... same with calls we have a lot of downside too. This is kinda limbo. But today may give us a good indication.

"SPY Day Trade mini-DDSo for you Spergs that have the AM to trade I want to just share a quite obviously day trading strategy that requires real time quotes, an understanding of intraday levels, &amp; balls of steel (unless you're a stop loss tard).

Look at SPY chart on the daily. Instead of gambling &amp; holding SPY calls overnight (which I still do sometimes when I predict daily/weekly/monthly moves) I've found it can be just as rewarding -again if you have the time, real-time quotes, &amp; an inclination for yolo- to day trade SPY. The logic is that SPY has been inversing itself in the first hour or so of trading recently which can bring huge gains on options about to expire. Basically you buy slightly OTM options (&lt;$1) w/ expiry either the next day or the day you're trading at the low, and sell high.

Yeah. Obviously this is risky AF as theta seriously works against you and if SPY doesn't rise or fall fast enough you're screwed, not to mention if it goes the wrong way. A stop loss isn't a bad idea but gaps will hurt as well as the fact that you dont want to sell down 20% only to have it go up 100% (which happens all the time).

An example is today (or all last week...) SPY challenged 282.50 for the second time at approx 11am (bit later than usual) and I had my market order of 200 shares (fidelity's limit) ready to go on 282p. I wound up not executing because I wasn't positive of action, last monday we mooned and wasn't sure how today/this week would trade, if we would be held back by fed on weds, along with BA &amp; FB selloff (obviously we were and there's a reason why I'm on r/wsb). I wasn't about to lose 6k trading SPY on a Monday without real conviction (aka market feels).

"8-29-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market AnalysisWell if you know me you know my two least favorite types of days to trade are either days we open with a massive gap up or down and trend days‚Ä¶ today we got both. 

Lets break down the fuckery that was today. 

https://preview.redd.it/owyue00kqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3f3928be4c5de0b6dcac736a05e88761dbabd1b

Overnight we saw futures drop to -1% and higher for most of the night, however, by morning they had given back a lot of that overnight drop. Leaving a nice gap at 405.22 to be filled. From 930am till about 1030am the bulls tried as hard as they could to gap fill and failed everytime. This sent us into a pretty convincing sell off. However, the bulls had other plans in mind and from 11am till really the last candle of the day the bulls were in control. The most impressive thing was despite all the times that SPY looked weak and ready to break down with perfect setups and even volume dumping the bulls managed to rip the candles back bullish. I actually am impressive after Friday massively red day and the massive red futures and red gap down we had that the bulls were able to take control the way they did today. 

Once we gap filled 405.2 continued to be support. It was not until the last candle of the day that we finally saw the actual weakness of the day set it with a nice nearly $2 sell off on the last 15minute candle. 

https://preview.redd.it/br7bpuokqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9abc28ec28fcc0db77502675210b1ce4e47d48aa

We are trading below key resistance levels of 405.2 now. With that resistance we should expect to revisit 390 now. As I mentioned we should expect to be able to play level to level on spy and apple. 

Key support for tomorrow is going to remain at 402.1. with the blue bull support being at 399.9. 

There is also a projected red bull channel to keep an eye on with support at 402.1 tomorrow. 

Interestingly enough this is giving me Monday/ Tuesday flashbacks from last week. We had a big red day followed by a gravestone doji with slightly lower lows made. 

Overall looking at the red bull channel we have possible upside of 424.4 this week and the blue bear channel gives potential downside of 395.4 this week. Of course this blue channels support is only projected so the actual downward channel support could be much lower then where we are currently. 

https://preview.redd.it/772e7wdlqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bae8a627f397dac89f4f3a56e433127052977f66

One interesting thing on the weekly that is forming is this solid black falling wedge. This falling wedge could actually result in a breakout to the upside. For this to play out we would have to hold the 401.2 low of day all week though. If we break that 401.2 level then that falling wedge will get negated. 

Key weekly resistance remains at 408.4 and major support down at 390.

https://preview.redd.it/5jspzqzlqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=196f441749f25ecec2479b9fa02bb934021ed342

Futures daily looking the same as SPY with Key support of 4023 over night and tomorrow. From there the blue bear channel support is at 3995 with the red bull channel support at 4032.

Upside potential for the red bull channel is 4332 and blue bull channel potential downside is 3956.

https://preview.redd.it/08vi1njmqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e97cc83d51c1cba9007bb7ae1b4417294750a8b

Futures weekly shows the same possible falling wedge with key support being the lod of 4006 to hold the rest of the week. 

Key resistance for the weekly is 4112 and key support is 3902.

https://preview.redd.it/y0s3gg5nqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca1cca36dddec3caef8713f23c0dd134553b378c

Apple didn‚Äôt really have as dramatic of a day as SPY and they actually didn‚Äôt even gap fill completely today. And despite how many times SPY had retest hod apple never actually retested its HOD. 

Key support will remain at 159.8 tomorrow and if that breaks we should look for support at 158.2 and eventually gap fill at 157.64.

Blue bear channel support is at 159.2 for tomorrow with the red (this is the 12 week long bull channel) being at 156.8.

There is actually besides the 12 week bull support line not a smaller bull channel like spy/ es futures has. Therefore upside potential for Apple is 166.8 for blue bull channel resistance and support of 156.8 for downside potential based on the daily trends. 

If we see that 12 week bull support broken that would be a bigger omen for SPY and the markets in general. If we see big tech call that will be extremely bearish for the future. 

https://preview.redd.it/odcyw4snqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59854a27bdb0ef1599eb3e1a86b528edd7134224

Apple weekly does show that same falling wedge that SPY/ ES weeklies are showing. Key support will be at the 159.8 low for that. A key support to break through is the weekly level of 161.1 from there bears will look for support at 157.5. If 161.1 support holds bulls will look for 163.7 and 166.5.

https://preview.redd.it/4cfxlmcoqpk91.png?width=358&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb08147da117d9fcb91b63e7f25cc13df48b9168

I am actually long on some this Friday and next Friday DTE apple (were ATM) puts. There are a little red right now but with the trend continuing to show weakness by Friday I do plan for these to be fairly green. My target sell for the 4dte is 157.5 and for the 11dte is 154.3.

https://preview.redd.it/mkiom2uoqpk91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc7e08e997756eef31c295b59553772f5ffa2612

The VIX had an interesting day today. We had a really massive gap up that was followed by the gap filling and support at 25.5 being retested. That support held perfectly and resulted in a really big bounce up for VIX EOD and a close over 26. We are not trending back in the 25.5 to 34.7 channel that we have spent the majority of 2022 in. this is another bearish omen for the markets. As long as VIX is over 25.5 I do suspect we see downside. We lose 25.5 that will be a reason for the markets to turn around. 

So on Friday I mentioned while I wanted to be bearish I was skeptical. Like I had mentioned the markets need a reason to sell. And today they didn‚Äôt have a reason to sell. Almost all day we saw ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù playing out. It was clear who was in control today. However, EOD there we did see the bears take control with that $2 sell off. With the gap being filled and a rejection of key 405.2 level there could be a reason for the markets to sell off and there could be a reason markets do not want to hold anymore. The media is shifting to a really bearish narrative we haven‚Äôt seen since really February or march. This is going to be an interesting week and as long as SPY is below 405.2 resistance I favor a test of 390 support. 

10% challenge-

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7y4uxzfpqpk91.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ee3749eeab0a2f9eb3b053e536cee9d4a7a4114

Straight up bad day for me. Made a great trade in the morning. Got a bad bounce on a fake break down for the -13.2% loss. 

I trusted that a range day was building with 404 becoming resistance. I entered a put on that 1230 candle that massively broke down and regrettably broke my rules and entered with a SL. I saw how choppy markets were and ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt wanna get stopped out before I would get rewarded‚Äù because I was convinced we would see a massive sell off and close under 402.2 support. 

Well I was wrong obviously as they gap filled us and then every convincing sell off candle was just ripped back green and when we finally did sell off as I was expecting it was too late. Bad day and bad way to start the week off. No one to blame but myself. 

Important thing for me here is to not over trade and to not break any more of my rules‚Ä¶ when you take a tough loss you have to fight back organically. Don‚Äôt over trade and definitely don‚Äôt revenge trade trying to get back.

"Chart Voodoo and Dark Rituals - LULU &amp; NVDAI'm back with another installment of sinister magic. This week I learned a little bit about farming and the income I could make from it.

1. Sell your shares to Tesla for [$420](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/242/293/d49.jpg).

2. Hang on and get private TSLA stock.

3. Sell to the shorts for *motherfucking dump trucks worth of money*.

Obviously shareholders aren't going to choose option 1 except for those Ally account motherfuckers. So he'll take *a little* money from the shorts to cover those assholes. More importantly, let's talk about how he prevents option 3.

**Disclaimer- I have no fucking clue if this next part is even legal. But, [get in loser. We're committing securities fraud.](https://i.redd.it/7jroz9aeire11.jpg)) **

Once TSLA goes private, only people who previously held stock will be able to buy or sell. And, if you want to buy, it has to be as a ratio of what you currently hold. Sold all your shares to shorts? Fuck off, bucko. Enjoy your dirty scab money. Sold all *but one* share to shorts? Welcome to the club buddy, but you'll never hold a sizable number of shares. Once you're in though, you'll get some fucking sweet perks. Discounted Teslas? Free supercharging for life? Early access to order new models? You bet your fucking ass.

With that taken care of, shareholders are eager to join the club with as many tickets as possible, and shorts won't be able to buy stock from anyone but *motherfucking Elon Musk*. That's when the $11,000/share play happens. Right now, there's [fucking 35M shares short sold](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest). Let's say the shorts get off easy, and *only* need to sell half of those shares to Papa Musk/TSLA. *That's fucking $192.5B.* Musk, being the generous type, splits it between Tesla and SpaceX. Boom, bitches. TSLA buys out every other car manufacturer in the world, forces them to only make electric cars, and we're all taking vacations *to fucking Mars on a BFR*. That's right, Papa Musk is *literally taking us to Mars* with this play. And the share holders who own that private TSLA stock get first dibs with *premium space-cabins*.

In summary, fucking buy as many shares as you can and [get your ass to Mars](https://i.imgur.com/nhMp8Dm.jpg).

Khan played a crucial role as legal counsel for the House antitrust subcommittee‚Äôs 16-month investigation into the Big Tech giants, and in producing the 400-page House Democrat report that alleged that all of the tech giants engage in anti-competitive practices and need to be reined in.

Khan burst onto the scene in antitrust circles in 2017 when she penned a legal paper dubbed ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Antitrust Paradox,‚Äù which spread widely among proponents and critics alike.

Thoughts on market reversal. spy seems to have bounced off 4 day low with a CAHOLD set up. Correction bounced on 10% bottom and closed above 4 day high. Vix struggled at 32 resistance again.,1
"3/3/22 SPY Recap and AnalysisGoing into day 2 of JPOW Testimony I believe many expected yet another major rip of a day as markets were pleased with what ole money printer JPOW had to say. However, as I preach daily we can not go into a trading session bullish or bearish. We have to trade what is right in front of us. 

Overall Futures held up very nicely trading essentially completely flat all night until about 8am when we saw a massive spike in pre market taking SPY up to 441.5. However, that would be the high of the day and we would see a downtrend throughout the day. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2v7t8g7wl8l81.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a661c5c5cdcc44178793aa8222a734ddb5dd107c

Early morning we saw a very quick sell off taking us all the way to the intraday low of 433.8 before we had a classic SPY recovery/ rest near 439.4 (the daily 200 ema) before we continue back to the daily low of 433.8 during power hour. Overall finishing the day down only 0.48%. Which on the surface doesn‚Äôt seem like much, however, considering we Opened at 440.47 and closed at 435.77 that is quite the drop. Overall that a 1.1% decrease from open which is far more impressive then the actual closing % for the day.

Looking at the 15 minute chart overall its fairly neutral and would really allow room for some upside and downside depending on where futures take us tonight. RSI is flat around 40 and MACD is technically a sell however curling back towards the 0 line‚Ä¶ Interestingly enough the VIX again finished right near the 30 area. Crypt0 did see a larger sell off day today though which aligns with the market. Overall as much as I would like to get some direction of wher we are going to go we just don‚Äôt have enough information to play anything over night right here. It is also why we much go into a trading session with open minds and follow the trend intraday unbiasedly. 

Major resistance line to break for a breakout- 443

Major support that needs to hold to prevent sell off- 434

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9pz1r06vl8l81.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eba5b441cbca10f9201ed18bfcc56ce6c7212530

The daily chart does draw a big of a better picture of where things are headed but also does not give us any clear definitive direction. But I do see some major trend lines/ support and resistance lines we need to be watching tomorrow and headed into next week. 

Todays candle body broke above the 200 ema and the 20 ema on the daily for the first time since February 18th which is an overall bullish sign. However, we failed to close above the 200 ema (439.3) when it was very much so in range to do just that.

Todays candle wic also broke below the 8 ema of 435.03, however, at the end we managed to push and close above that. 

One interesting note on the daily chart is that the support line from the 410 V bottom that Tuesday and Wednesday candles used as bottom support was broke today.  

Going into tomorrow we will need to keep an major eye on these two support and resistance lines. Overall which ever one we close above or below tomorrow will in my opinion signal what next week will bring. 

Support- 435

Resistance 439.3 ÔÉ† 445 (top of grey channel) 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall this is not an environment I feel comfortable holding or recommend holding anything over night yet. Tomorrow power hour that may change if we get some clear direction. In general the Major resistance line is 445. Until that is broken I don‚Äôt feel comfortable risking it on calls with potential short term upside. There is clearly a lot of downward room to 400 to go, but after yesterday markets are currently bullish so you would be fighting the trend.",1

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington‚Äôs most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in [a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653?mod=article_inline)from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC‚Äôs work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency. Nearly one in four top FTC officials owned or traded individual stocks of tech companies such as [Amazon](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN).com Inc., [Meta Platforms](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/META) Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, [Alphabet](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOOG) Inc.‚Äôs Google, [Microsoft](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MSFT) Corp. and [Oracle](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ORCL) Corp.

"Can someone lay out the bull case for NFLX?Disclaimer: I own no position in Netflix currently but held a short position over earnings that was obviously profitable. 

I don‚Äôt understand the bull case here. Its P/E is over 100, which I understand can be justified by 1) the fact that most revenue is being reinvested in the company for future growth (see AMD) or 2) there is an anticipated huge amount of growth in the future. Usually it‚Äôs a combination of both. 

With Netflix, do we have either? It seems that Netflix has such a high spending budget because it invests in original content and licenses other shows. But unlike companies that invest in infrastructure and equipment, if Netflix wants to stay relevant, it must continue to do these things. It would be decades before Netflix has enough original content to get rid of the other stuff, and I‚Äôm not convinced it would be as popular without it.

In addition, do we really see massive growth from here? It seems that most people who want Netflix have Netflix, hence the drop in domestic growth, and that it just doesn‚Äôt have the same appeal internationally (hence the disappointing numbers). If you travel, you know that nobody consumes streaming TV like Americans. We will never see comparable adoption abroad. 

So, I ask, why is this stock so expensive? Looking for real discussion here if possible.",0

If i do i may not always post every night if i am too busy before work. I work night shift so sometime during the night though i will post. Just know once i get back to work full time i wont post as much unfortunately. 
I also thought about it and if i can get up to 2500 followers i think i will seriously consider some sort of discord or YouTube channel. And perhaps with like 5k followers come june maybe even something full time where i live trade with you guys and show you what im seeing and why. Thoughts? 

Also make sure to follow my actual profile on here because all these subs LOVEEEE deleting my ta for whatever reason... 

Anyways lets get into it! 

To me today was a confirmation day. I fully expected after market and futures wise that we woulda started the day down 1-2% not up 1.5% i believe it was. Nonetheless today was a very telling day in my opinion. What we saw today was a retest of the upper limit of this downward bearish channel we have been trading in since January 3rd. Look at the green dotted channel on the 30 minute. It has developed some very strong resistance now with from January 3rd to present being touched and officially rejected 4 times and 2 other times where it nearly touched the line. Thats a very stout resistance line that if we ever break it should provide some very heavy upward movement. https://i.imgur.com/bBk4yhZ.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/8iDmj1m.jpeg

What i watched develop this morning intraday (always watching the 30 min) was the MACD turning from buy to sell AND most importantly as we neared the top of the channel at the time of 441.5 was that the RSI was around 63. To me that showed that this did not have the momentum to break through. When we rejected the 441.5 twice i bought some 2/4 440P and 339p and one 1/28 440p... all three played very heavily. I got greedy and missed some gains though when we broke 430 for a second but recovered to 433 before market close. I was looking for the bottom drop and never got it. Left some on the table but still paid out &gt;50% for all 3.  Not bad at all. 

Things im watching for tomorrow is Apple crushing earnings and being up 5% after hours. Now apple can NOT hold the market up on its own as much as people like to think it can. However oddly enough once apple released cry*pto pulled outta its nose dive and spy went from red to green. However, take tesla for instance today... tesla was down 5% while spy was up nearly 2% and tesla finished down 11%. Even the otherday on Tuesday Microsoft was up while the market was down if i remember correctly (or inverse). Either way what im saying is one company will not hold the market up. Though apple is the first big top 10 to release a stellar earnings so some sentiment may change... just keep in mind after and pre market are easily skewed by retail... tesla today was up right until the market open then we saw the true hedgefund take... 
(side note i bet tesla starts its decline down to 500-600 now... tesla today once again broke 25% correction from highs... the market FINALLY sees tesla as over valued and i think we see them take a fairly big hit down. Once this does it will finish our correction of spy and nasdaq to total of 25%... i think msft and apple will maintain their valuations). 

So onto tomorrow what should we suspect? 

Well interestingly after hours on my chart (some webull users say they did not see this on theirs). I saw a massive spike up to again fall just short of the green dotted resistance line. 

30 min macd did turn to buy. Rsi is curling upward and leaving room for another run at this resistance line. Though i doubt we break it. My anticipation is tomorrow we test that resistance line early morning again near 439-440 and then dip after again. 

We saw extremely strong support today near 430. We DID break it very quickly but the buy pressure was too much. This is our fight zone. 430 and 440. One thing i am seeing is we have moved so far upward in this green dotted channel that unless we see some massive sell off days despite being bearish long term we will break it. However 2 or 3 days of nothing but sell offs (which we have not seen any days of just pure red this week will push us low enough to stay in the channel). Realistically we need a red day to finish down 1-2% in order to stay in this channel. And honestly we are kinda due for one. Im shocked that both today and yesterday stopped short of only about 0.5-1% down.

Supports intraday- 429.5 --&gt; 425 --&gt; 420.76 
Resistance intraday- 434.5 --&gt; 440 --&gt; breakout

Support-
-1%=427
-2%= 422.6
-3%= 418.3 

Resistance-
+1%=435.6
+2%= 439.8
+3% 444.17

Looking at the % up and down we can go its interesting that being up 2% tomorrow still keeps us in this bearish channel. Now mind you as time progresses the channel progresses with the chart so towards end of day tomorrow the upper limit of the channel will probably be closer to 438 or so...  i really am surprised we have not sold off yet to touch that 420 support area we saw this week... and i think maybe tomorrow could be the day it happens. 

Overall the chart and sentiment is still bearish. If and when we break this green dotted channel i will consider whether or not we are bullish. There is another resistance line up near 460 we have to break in order to see a full recovery breakout.",1

Did bulls run out of energy already? 

My next play is to play the sidelines. Going to wait for the vix to drop and then ease into some longer dated puts once folks start feeling greedy around the 400 level, which I think MAY come as soon as next Tuesday before the CPI report but thats merely a guess. We also now have a gap below us to fill at 378.70. What a time to be alive.

"Meta is not bottoming out yet despite this week's rally. They are buying revenue at steep prices, and user base is still leaving.This week has been good for many of our tech stocks. Meta went up 5% today together with the rest of the market and I believe this was a good buying opportunity for a put option.

I think Meta is still on a downward spiral, and it's not the bottom yet. These are my thoughts only, and not extensive DD...not much science, lots of intuition and anecdotal perspectives. I wanted to post here for you to challenge and see what others might think.

Meta's main business is advertisement - and these ads are not selling nearly as well as they used to. With Apple's significant changes to iOS and Safari, this cripples advertisers ability to target users as well as before. This is resulting in fewer ads being sold as advertisers are moving to other channels and overall putting less value into FB/IG ads.Some anecdotal evidence that might be the tip of the iceberg for Meta ads business continuing to decline. Amex just put up an offer for advertisers to spend $350 and get $150 back. That's over 40% off! Almost always, these offers are funded by the actual company, not Amex - and Amex in fact sometimes charge the company to show these offers to their members. So we're likely looking at a \~10% fee that brings up the total cost to \~50% to Meta.

So if Meta is trying to buy revenue at 50% margin, that's pretty bad.Meta doesn't have that great margin already, and has been on a serious decline, down below 25% in the latest quarter. A year ago, it was 35% - that's a 28% drop in one year. And their debt is climbing every quarter as they continue to invest in metaverse (whatever that is) - with no realistic path to sustainable profitability in that new space (pun intended).

Reminder that the past quarters have been pretty grim too:

* Meta posts first-ever revenue drop as inflation throttles ad sales: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-parent-meta-forecasts-revenue-below-estimates-2022-07-27/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-parent-meta-forecasts-revenue-below-estimates-2022-07-27/)

Oculus VR is not going anywhere. And TikTok is coming up with their own VR hardware system too: [https://www.techradar.com/news/rumors-of-a-new-oculus-quest-2-competitor-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-meta](https://www.techradar.com/news/rumors-of-a-new-oculus-quest-2-competitor-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-meta)

Doesn't help that TikTok is set to overtake Facebook on influencer spend despite having far fewer users. IG is still holding strong but I can see this declining as more and more influencers (and users) use TikTok instead of IG. IG is trying desperately to copy TikTok features, and it really only causes two things:

1. Validate user wants that TikTok is the preferred platform, train users to get used to the TikTok UI (migratory: shifts user / market share to TikTok)
2. Alienate users who DO NOT like the TikTok UI and they spend less overall time on social media (destructive: reduces the overall social media pie, and share for FB/IG)

&amp;#x200B;

Proof of position here.

Trump can't tweet about trade wars or Amazon with the investigation right at his doorstep. Stormy Daniels' lawyer is on MSNBC right now saying that he will almost assuredly get a deposition from Cohen and/or Trump now. This means Trump will be too preoccupied to fuck with the markets. Congress will not back Trump when it comes to tariffs because the optics are too bad with everything going on, and possibly even publicly go against him. Congress will also make moves to protect Mueller as Trump wants to fire Mueller real hard now. President Xi Jinping will see the writing in the sand and announce nothing big during his little announcement today because he knows Trump is about to go down and has no power to do anything to China.

"AMD Q1 2019 PREDICTIONS &amp; PLAYS**AMD Q1 2019 PREDICTIONS &amp; PLAYS**

People are starting to look beyond the numbers at AMD vs Intel, and they are starting to question anything that Intel has to say about their fabrication process improvements. Negatives for Intel include: CPU IPC has been largely stagnant for the past FOUR years. For those not familiar, IPC is Instructions Per Clock. It has nothing to do with the number of CPU cores, or the speed of a chip, and is entirely about how many instructions are executed per clock cycle. So a 2.0GHz chip with ah higher IPC will perform better than a 2.0GHz chip with a lower IPC. If the clock speeds increase, performance will go up, but newer chips with the same IPC won't be any faster when running at that 2.0GHz speed.

With Inte, 10nm being delayed itself would just mean that clock speeds won't go up, but a lack of any IPC improvements show that Intel is not improving the design of its chips well enough. So, what has Intel been doing over the past FOUR years where IPC hasn't improved? Intel finally improved the thermal interface material for better cooling of the chip itself(under the cover), so you see some speed increases, but there were already enthusiasts who were removing the lid from the chip to do this improvement themselves;, and the results has shown that the chips themselves have not really been improved, the news chips have better assembly.

So, AMD....When AMD first launched Ryzen in 2017, many people were surprised, if not shocked. Not only did AMD release 8 core chips(while Intel had stayed with 4 core chips) in the consumer space, but the new Zen core design was fairly competitive on an IPC basis as well. This allowed AMD to be every competitive with their new chips, and the only advantage that Intel had was a slight advantage in IPC, as well as high clock speeds. AMD offering double the number of cores did make Ryzen a very competitive product in most areas. Since that time, AMD boosted the IPC from first to second generation, as well as providing a bit better clock speed. Looking forward, the third generation Ryzen chips are expected in the next months (announcement and specs due on May 27th), with a 13-15% IPC improvement over second generation, and potentially a jump of 20% in clock speeds. Yes, this is a 20% boost on top of the 13-15% performance boost even at the previous speeds, so you can see how big of a jump this is expected to be, depending on clock speeds.

AMD isn't stagnant in IPC, isn't stagnant in clock speeds, and may even double the core counts to 16 cores in consumer grade chips. This is why things look very promising for AMD in the second half of 2019. Intel isn't expected to have 10nm desktop chips ready before 2021 at this point, so that is why those who understand the technology see so much potential for AMD right now. AMD has at the very least, a year where it will be well ahead of Intel. Q1 and Q2 are the periods before the new chips are released, and many are waiting to buy the new chips, so a slowdown in sales SHOULD be expected.

"GUYS you might want to see this. I struck lightning. I made a program that nailed the open and close in TSLA recently. Accuracy that would take 5720 years of guesses to see.Ok, so a couple weeks ago I made the prediction that GME would go up 20% to 70% within a few days.  And I nailed it.  I didn't explain to you all here that I made a program that calculated the odds out for me.  I'm actually a bit of a quantitative analyst.  So I started working on my program some more and I ironed out a few kinks, and my program gave some interesting results after the fomc conference.  It caught a correlation and it gave a very high degree of accuracy of the following:

  


https://preview.redd.it/qafgqmpchqp91.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ce3f9bdec7aa272bf3bbc8cff2e5f9a1f75db5b

Here's what I predicted on 9/21, and here's what actually happened:

https://preview.redd.it/dl32l3rnhqp91.png?width=424&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bd1ec7d5e7109d2e502866dfc2f55a3719ec87b

TWO days ago I made a prediction of todays open and nailed it, TO THE PENNY.  If you guessed every trading day what the open would be, to the penny for TSLA, you would only get it right once every 8.75 years or so.  I also was only 2 pennies off from nailing the close of yesterday.  And only 32 cents of from nailing the open of yesterday.  

Here's proof that I called the things before they happened:  

Here's where I posted it on [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com/ItAlwaysWorksOut/message/486290636)

Here's a screen shot of that post:

The odds of getting THAT accurate are astonishing.  It blows my mind.  I calculated the odds out and to get the close of yesterday within two pennies, followed by the open dead on, would only happen after 1,441,464 guesses ( Or 5720 years).

Now here's the part for you!  The program also calculates with a high degree of accuracy that TSLA will open on monday at $268.36 and close on monday at $259.43.",1

As you can see, these stocks have noticeably increased social activity that appears to be trending up in the last 2-3 months.

Now, what about stocks that have already revisited their bear market lows? Let‚Äôs take a look at a couple of popular stock picks that have performed poorly price-wise and spot the differences:

**NVIDIA $NVDA:**

[$NVDA Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/l8dhcjzg9op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e30185a23cb56a6e87bb09bd5d9675f45c6d52)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Adobe $ADBE:**

[$ADBE Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/ahfsazxi9op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b5e6446f2d5ea7aef2dd8def6348a41575a406b)

While $NVDA and $ADBE experienced recent spikes in social activity, they do not show the same kind of sustained growth in activity (continuous interest from people) as many of the better-performing stocks. 

Therefore, in times like these when the macro environment and markets are bearish, it‚Äôs probably best to keep your eye on stocks with sustainable increases in social activity, rather than the stocks with little growth or growth that fades quickly. 

So, will $TSLA, $AMZN, and $AAPL hold above their bear market lows? Or follow the rest of the market? 

While the social data presented in these charts don't provide the answers, they do provide a different perspective that's interesting to think about.

"TSLA and GME - A Match Made in Heaven and Why I Like These Stocks - Together - As One Stock - Fuck The Shorts**I like Tesla. I like Gamestop. In fact, I like them so much, I think they should be just one stock.** 

We know Gamestop is a 500Bil Market Cap Company. They have the locations. They have the games. They gave power to us, the players. I like this stock. 

We know Tesla is the best Large Cap Company. They have the cars. They have the electricity. They gave us hope before and during the VID hit. I like this stock.

When I like two stocks, I like them. And I like them a lot. So I want them to join together. 

&gt;  ""But how can they join together?"" you may ask. 

Elon is a rich man. In fact, if my calculations are correct, he is very rich. Rich enough to buy gamestonk outright. So while this squeeze is going down he should hop in, fuck the shorts on the way up, and take majority shareholder ownership at the same time. 

* Once he has ownership, he can use gamestop locations as Tesla showrooms, complete with charging stations, cafes, and game rooms. He sell games. Tesla game exclusives. Good games, as a matter of fact. How about a game system rivaling the PS4? A Tesla Game system exclusive to Tesla showrooms and Tesla cars?

Bought a Tesla? Get gamestonk the more data you help provide to their AI. Have Tesla stock or Gamestonks? Save on Gamestonk exclusive meme merchandise. This is a no brainer and I hope we can garner his support. 

**tldr; Elon should buy GME, fuck the shorters, GME 5000, make us rich so people who like GME can buy Teslas**",1

Source:[The Reasonable Formation of Unreasonable Things](https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/Collaborative%20Fund%20Bubbles.pdf)

There is a distinct difference between volatility and things getting completely out of hand.

Stocks fell 19% in the summer of 2011, and quickly recovered. That‚Äôs volatility. The Nasdaq fell 80% after 2000, and didn‚Äôt recover for a decade. That‚Äôs something else.

But the fact that markets spread from volatile to utterly out of control -- like a bubble -- makes sense. Rational sense. It makes so much sense that we should expect it to keep happening.

One of the biggest flaws to come out of academic finance is the idea that assets have one rational price in a world where investors have different goals and time horizons.

Ask yourself: How much should you have paid for Yahoo! stock in 1999? The answer depends on who ‚Äúyou‚Äù are.

If you have a 30-year time horizon, the smart price to pay was a sober analysis of Yahoo!‚Äôs discounted cash flows over the subsequent 30-years.

If you have a 10-year time horizon, it‚Äôs some analysis about the industry‚Äôs potential over the next decade and whether management could execute on its vision.
If you have a 1-year time horizon, it‚Äôs an analysis of current product sales cycles and whether we‚Äôll have a bear market.

If you‚Äôre a daytrader, the smart price to pay is ‚Äúwho the hell cares?,‚Äù because you‚Äôre just trying to squeeze a few basis points out of whatever happens between now and lunchtime, which can be accomplished at any price.

When investors have different goals and time horizons -- and they do in every asset class -- prices that look ridiculous for one person make sense to another, because the factors worth paying attention to are totally different.

People can look at Yahoo! stock in 1999 and say ‚ÄúThis is crazy! A zillion times reve- nue! This valuation makes no sense!‚Äù

But many investors who owned Yahoo! stock in 1999 had time horizons so short that it made sense for them to pay a ridiculous price.

A daytrader could accomplish what they need whether Yahoo! was at $5 a share or $500 a share, as long as it moved in the right direction. Which it did, for years.

Money chases returns. Bubbles form when the momentum of short-term returns attracts enough money that the makeup of investors shifts from mostly long term to mostly short term.

That process feeds on itself. As traders push up short-term returns, they attract more traders. Before long -- and it really doesn‚Äôt take long -- the dominant price-setters with the most authority are those with ever-shortening time horizons.",0

"3/30/22 SPY Daily TAThe bears did it! They finally had a red day! OF course, the bulls had to rally the last 30 minutes and not let the bears enjoy too much fun today. But overall we finally had a red day. 

https://preview.redd.it/hyv6sdw08mq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c26d2af910fc09a8e7d77acb02c41c0dcc7ef37

After the bears managed to secure a red open it looked like initially the bulls were gonna turn this red day into yet another green day. Thankfully, the bears finally around 1015am were able to get some footing but it was not until about 1230 that we finally saw the bears really dig in. With the 459.2 double top the bears were able to sink SPY all the way to 456.47 for the low of the day during power hour. I had called yesterday that we were going to have a red day and a gap fill and we came within about 70 cents of filling the gap. It definitely is not 100% filled but it very well may be ‚Äúgood enough ‚Äú for now. 

End of day saw an amazing rally where the bulls got it all the way back up to and through the intraday resistance line and back at that heavy 459.2 resistance line. 

It was quite wild and boring watching intraday today considering we only have about a range of $2.6 from open until 145pm where we finally saw a bigger move. 

https://preview.redd.it/hqpf89b28mq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65ae717ccbc0a782ab1514eec158b5cbe8989bc0

The question going into tomorrow is will the bulls gap this through resistance at 460 and retest the current highs of 462 with a target of 465-468 or will the bears have another day to themselves when we test the channel support near 456 with a goal of retesting and breaking through 454 support and targeting the heavily target 448-450 range. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can see we are trending downward in the channel finally but watching intraday today it was a struggle for the bears all day. 

https://preview.redd.it/95sl04g38mq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9572d6c167e12ad1b3136915635d08853b2abc8d

The VIX once again had an impressive day with quite the range with a big gap up at open to 19.71 then a big gap down to 18.72 at open. The VIX too traded within a very tight range all afternoon from 19.6 to 19.2 before it finally saw a massive pop to 20.51 during power hour and then elevatored down to a close at 19.34. With the VIX being so low the wild swings and moves are going to be less impressive. The best plays I had today were all when the VIX made a big move. That is the best way to play this low volume currently. 

Apple FINALLY saw a red day! It snapped its longest green streak since 2003 which was 11 days. Closing down a very modest -0.66%. Apple looked incredibly weak intraday today and very much so struggled to get through most resistance. 

The Daily chart looks like we are riding the 8ema wave all the way to ATH. With the gap essentially being filled SPY like I said can easily go back on a bull run tomorrow. With the current channel the max I see is 470 and the lowest I would suspect is 450. 

https://preview.redd.it/25mhm5t48mq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb6dd3f2ba49549fd4eec787d06b63377d9e7156

With March ended which has essentially been a recovery month it will be interesting to see if the start of April Friday will bring a retrace of if we will continue the bullrun. At this rate we very well could see ATH by next week. Which is just absolutely mind blowing to me. 

10% challenge- 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I again practiced patience making four total trades today. Three were smaller morning plays with a -30% put at open, a 45% put on the first major dip, a 20% apple put and then a big 50% put on spy at the end of the day riding it from the 130pm highs to pretty much bottom. 

Overall was a very good day today. And despite my greedy Monday that burnt me it has been an excellent week already.",0

On Friday I mentioned the purple channel of death that we have been trading within. All of Fridays price action was within that channel and today we were once again within that channel. However, today we had the black plague channel where we spent most of the morning until about 115pm when we finally saw a break upward. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jgjr4yt2hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a7c14de14b2eee729a8900572d773a0e9b4eb05

Using the resistance of Thursday and Friday I was able to form a bull channel that SPY traded within today and actually EOD bounced right off of. 

After hours we are actually seeing that red support line being broken down. 

Right now after hours we will watch for 398.5 support (black channel) to hold or break. The 15min and the 5min have both been riding the 8ema downward since about 230pm when we saw a huge rejection at 403.97 for the intraday high. Black channel resistance is 401.6. 

I am looking for over night to see SPY break this 398.5 support and test 396.1 near open. There is a chance we could see spy hold 398.5 and test 404.3 channel resistance (purple) at open but my guess being that the bulls were unable to follow through today and with Jpow speaking tomorrow is that we will see a fairly red open somewhere between that 398.5 and 396.1 range. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kchvrhg3hxz81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68606e15c9243609c88ea99326ddac8c8ec2ec03

Daily chart you can see we closed a daily doji today which after an attempted breakout and recovery from 385 bounce Thursday that is not a very good finish. While I expected us to follow through and touch 412 (red channel resistance) it looks like we are very well may head back down for another grey channel support line test near 382 this week. Today the bulls also once again failed to break the daily 8ema which is also another bearish indicator when it was so easily in their grasps. 

We have also seen a dramatic decrease in volume over the last week. We haven‚Äôt seen volume this low since April 20th which was the day before a massive dump. 

If we are able to get a bullish day tomorrow 405.2 is going to be the major hurdle to get over and most likely will act in a similar manner 430 resistance did. 

We are also looking at a 404 double top with May 11ths candle

As you can see the bearish momentum and indications are continuing to add up.

Major daily supports- 398.2 √† 392.9 √† 385.4

Major daily resistance- 402.5 (daily 8ema) √† 405.2 √† 411 (red channel resistance)

Keep in mind weekly support is 380 and weekly resistance is 445.

Lastly we can take a look at the VIX‚Ä¶ the VIX actually had a pretty massive day today opening near 30.23 and reaching 27.36 at its lows‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a drop of nearly $3 or 10% while SPY had a red day. That‚Äôs a very important thing to note. In general its not a perfect correlation but if the VIX is dropping and SPY is having a red day that means overall the market is agreeing in the bearish movement and is no scared by the bearish movement. That‚Äôs something I mentioned last week that occurred a few times. 

The other thing to note about the VIX is that the last time we saw a big drop like this in the VIX to this level we had a huge recoil the following day back over 30. 

&amp;#x200B;

Actually now that I see it that has happened two different times. Once on May 4th (FOMC meeting when we rallied to 430 then dumped the next day) and then once on April 25th we closed very close to this same level. So it looks like April 25th was a 0.58% green day that closed at 428.51 and was followed up by a -2.9% red day that closed at 416.1. So that will be something interesting to watch over night. We very well could see the same outcome. 

10% challenge-

These range, chop, theta burning reversal on reversal days are wrecking havocing on my lately. I feel like no matter how much we try they are truly just unplayable. This pretty much is a scalping market and cut your loses early kinda market. Which is even harder when the trend reverses every 30 minutes for 3 hours straight. But in the end I was able to make a few risky plays EOD to recover some losses but still finished down around -3x daily profit goal. A recoverable loss. 

&amp;#x200B;

The 4dte and 10dte were calls I held over the weekend that I cut the losses on and shoulda just closed out on Friday but they were relatively smaller positions. But the 0dte for -32% and the -44% 2dte puts did the most damage today. I am thinking of forcing myself to add a -25% trailing stop loss onto my positions until we get outta this reversal happy market.

I am carrying this 2dte over night tonight. I expect based on the fact that bulls failed to capitalize on what shoulda been an easy softball pitch to 412 resistance today that we are in store for more downside. I also am banking on a pop in the VIX overnight with all the feds speaking and JPOW and will be holding this in hope of another big dump. Now quite sure we get a -3% days like the last two drops below 28 but heres to hoping right? haha",0

"I'm betting the house and car that Meta will collapse.# TLDR; Meta below 100 one year from today.

&amp;#x200B;

One year from now, Meta will be below 100.  That's an generous number too.  Facebook is financing MetaVerse with everything it gets from whatsapp, instagram and facebook.  Toss in long-term debt and when things get desperate, current debt, long behold, you'll have a total and complete disaster.

Now, think about it's up coming earnings.  We all know what happened in it's previous earnings.  Ask yourself this:  *Do you really think anything has changed? Has anyone heard or seen change that'd somehow rectify it's previous loss let alone prevent further loss?* **The answer is no.**  Nothing has changed and if you think for one minute marketing didn't either, you're a fool.

It's almost common sense.  If you were a marketing firm that paid Meta for advertising prior to it's previous earnings, would you continue spending the same amount if not more given what previous earnings released said? What about how the company has gone about rectifying the loss let alone preventing further loss?  To top that is the opportunity cost you sacrifice sticking around when you could go to Tik Tok or other up and growing platforms. The cherry on top to all this is Meta's latest smear campaign via Tik Tok which Meta clearly didn't think strongly about as far as the message the public would get (namely its investors).

# Now, that's just earnings....

Here is why Meta will ultimately fail:

For whatever reason, Zuck actually thought that Oculus' failure was because it wasn't designed around social media.  That's hysterical. Does anyone here actually see themselves dawning this headset on their lunchbreak at work?  How about in bed before you sleep?  In the morning with your coffee?  How about when you're taking a shit?  At a stop light or traffic?

I suppose if you have ass paper money and have nothing better to do, ya, whatever.

But for everyone else, you know, the populous that check it from dawn to dusk, not only does this now cost consumers money to use, but it's practical use and exposure to ads is VASTLY limited compared to things now.  I mean think about it.  If advertising is moving it's money away from Meta now, imagine what it will be once it finds out that what the real mean-time exposure to ads would be? It'd be limited to the evening and a very selective audience while competing against free platforms who offer exposure to ads all day long which means LOTS of revenue.

Bottom line is this:

Zuck is a fraud.  He is the male equivalent to Elizabeth Homes.  The path this firm has moved too makes complete sense because Zuck never designed Facebook.  He stole the idea.  He never had the fundamental creativity or intellect to understand how this all drives demand and the very epitome of this shows through meta.

**Predictions**

The CPI data released on Thursday before open is what basically all retail and big funds will be watching, Powell has stated that if inflation gets worse then the federal reserve will have to do stronger rate hikes.  Commodities are soaring: wheat futures, crude oil futures.  While the big money does not want to admit it, the inflation data released on the 10th will be worse than most people are expecting.   The situation in Ukraine is sadly not getting any better; Russia announced a ceasefire and then continued to shell buildings.  Since inflation is getting worse and commodities are soaring the fed is now forced into drastic measures to raise the interest rates.

From the technical indicators the whole market is extremely bearish.  On the NASDAQ 100 the 50 day moving average has crossed the 200 day moving average which is known as a ""death cross"" signaling a long term bear market.  The RSI is above 50 on SPY so selling pressure will be coming soon.

I really think that another red week is on the way.  The market will pullback in anticipation for the CPI data release and it will be very interesting to see what happens afterward.

***TLDR: Google is doing the same thing Apple did.***

Something else that has been happening in the stock market world:  
Mark Zuckerberg has held over 50% of FB since founding it and he had an interesting time in those early days! Fought to ensure he had the majority piece of that pie.

Hes been selling his stock for ages now. $21m a day IIRC for i dont even know how long. months at least.

Recently Jack Dorsey also left Twitter to focus on Defi banking... interesting

The douche who replaced him at twitter immediately upped the censorship on the platform in lines with MSM/govts etc demands of ""misinformation"".

Is Zuck about to leave Meta? Is Meta/FB the target for a hostile take over, like Bear Sterns was? Big tech assassination, assisted by the big banks/Wall St to crush it into the dirt so the biggest social media data pool in history can be taken over by....?

Banks? US Gov? \*World Economic Forum has entered the chat\*

"Interactive Brokers just increased margin requirements for holding $TSLALooks like a lot of you dummies got margin called. Full letter below:

Margin Increase - Tesla Inc.
 
 
Dear Client,

In light of the current trading environment, IBKR will be increasing the margin requirement for all Tesla Inc. (TSLA) products (Stock, Equity Options, Futures and CFDs).  The first in a series of margin increasing steps is scheduled for May 29, 2019.   

Trading accounts holding Stocks, Equity Options, Futures and CFDs should expect the margin requirement to increase to a minimum of 40%, up from its current level of 30%. Please note that in risk-based accounts other house margin charges may increase the margin requirement above the 10% indication. The increases will be implemented in a series of gradual steps over a 10-day period in order to allow traders to adjust their portfolios and/or capital positions accordingly.  As such, traders should plan on the minimum margin to increase 1% every day, starting after the US close on Wednesday, May 29, 2019, and concluding after the US close on Friday, June 7, 2019. 

As the effect of this change is portfolio-dependent, we strongly recommend that you review the impact of this change before its full implementation on Friday June 7, 2019, and arrange to have sufficient excess financial capacity to absorb the expected margin increases and take action, if necessary, to ensure margin compliance throughout the implementation period in order to avoid liquidations  

To evaluate the impact of this change on your portfolio, please utilize IBKR's Risk NavigatorSM to understand how margin will change based upon the current holdings in your portfolio, as well as to determine the margin requirement for any portfolio that you may elect to construct/test. To evaluate the impact of this proposed change on your margin requirements, please see KB2957 and, from the margin mode setting, select ""TSLA Margin 20190607"".

Consistent with our stated policy, an account that is unable to carry the positions under these new margin requirements will be subject to liquidation in order to bring the account into margin compliance.",0

"6-7-22 SPY Daily TAI wanted to address some changes im making before I get into the TA. I am going to be very conservative in my trading for the foreseeable future I have decided to cut my position size by 1/5th and my daily profit goal by 1/5th. Right now this is a tough market and until we get back to the clear trend days and a non reversal happy SPY there is no reason for me to trade full position sizes nor be aggressive. 

Also to any of you guys using ARMERs momentum need to realize its function and limitation... this is NOT build for quick scalps (well i take that back it IS but its missing the money flow aspect of it). this shows sustained momentum trends... this shows the trend we can trust and confirms momentum... this is to be used in addition to the 8ema (my opinion not his)... we can look at just momentum and easily make some trades... HOWEVER, we need to be correct and time it correctly... 

the thing about this too is this may give one or two perfect trades a day (like the call i took earlier) we need to be patient... this isnt a enter as soon as it flashes as it can flash off quickly if momentum isn‚Äôt sustained.  

For me this is how i use this.... SPY, spy breadth, SPY MACDBB 1min, VOLSPD, VOLD and ADSPD (advancing/ declining stocks) have to all be the same confirmed momentum and the VIX has to be trending with ADX and momentum (opposing obviously) before I enter. 

IF any of them is missing i wont enter (this is my new rules after so many reversals and fake outs) today so far its saved me from 4 potential trades i would have entered but was missing one aspect.... 

Also, for me i use this as an exit... IF we are in a trade and we turn off momentum then im out. we can always re-enter but if we lose an indicator i like to exit... this is my new trading method. and also how i recommend trading this market until we get back I not a smoother SPY.

(Time to exit from bullish entry)

Obviously this is an extremely conservative approach to trading but as I have said numerous times now this is how we need to trade this market‚Ä¶ There is no reason to be aggressive right now. The markets not giving us much anymore. We need to be in asset conservation mode right now. Take what we can get and GTFO until the markets ready to be how it used to be.

One would assume when SPY opens -1% red with an elevated VIX that we would be drilling all day long correct? Well one would be wrong. Today we saw the VIX hit a peak of 26.24 right before market open and then from there it never stopped unwinding all day long. This unwinding of the VIX was critical to SPYs morning run and the EOD run too. However, looking at the VIX one would assume we would have a 2%+ green day not this measly 0.96% green day BUT technically with the morning dump and pre market dump we did see about a 2% green intraday move. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pvw6wql3oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ccd2189de4cbe522147d213f5fbfec0336a31fb

Trend wise you can see that we clearly broke out of the bull channel. However, we are maintaining the purple ‚Äúsideways‚Äù channel which is really a slightly downward channel. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kw0dm564oa491.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=513cf99790b1dadecda4ad20c0410ccdb17ed77d

With a slight tweak we might actually be in a slightly bullish upward channel. Personally I favor us topping out, with today confirming the break of the bull channel and we will now start our downward decent. Especially with CPI Friday and FOMC next Friday I have a hard time believing that we are going to be very bullish long term. 

On the daily I highlighted three big green candles. As you can see the last two big green candles were followed by red days with the most recent one being a significant gap down. 

On the daily we did close over resistance of 415.5, however, we failed to breach the higher lows trend of the channel. Tomorrow daily range for the purple channel is 416 to 405. If we break out of 416 then we might be in that black channel I mentioned, but again I favor at best some sideways action. I think there is a lot more pressure on this CPI then the previous ones personally. If this is a miss we are gonna see a bigger reaction then we do most CPIs.

As you can see the VIX is slowly unwinding I mentioned yesterday that bulls would not be able to get any sort of footing if we did not see the VIX break under and hold under 24.8. Well today they finally did it. We are not approaching a longer term support line for the VIX. It will be very interesting tomorrow to see what the VIX does‚Ä¶ If we see a massive recoil off of this 24 support range I bet we will start our ascent back to 30+ VIX with CPI and FOMC being the fear inducing catalysts. However, if tomorrow they unwind it further I will be looking for 20 VIX and will be anticipating that CPI on Friday will start the spike of the VIX. My working theory is that MM are unwinding the VIX slowly but surely without really bumping SPY up all that much in order to all the VIX to properly spike during CPI and FOMC. If they hadn‚Äôt unwound the VIX then CPI and FOMC would almost certainly give us VIX 40+ and SPY sub 360. 

10% challenge-

Today I went ultra-conservative and honestly I kinda enjoyed it. I made a few mental ‚Äúentries‚Äù today that were aggressive (and definitely not following my trading method above) and all of them got burnt to crisps. So going heavy conservative and getting a W today felt great. I missed the morning run and the last thing I wanted to do was FOMO into SPY today. The mid day was set up till about 1230 for a massive dump back to where we opened but all of a sudden at 1230 we got a massive volume spike which subsequently led to 415.74 EOD. 

I also took profits quicker then I would have liked to today as I felt the 3dtes were getting massively theta burned and IV crushed to the point where there was little reward to the risk. All three of these positons went on to see 20-30% if not more gains, however, with the IV crush, theta burn and overall lack of trust in this market I took profits when I could and was happy to sit the sidelines today. Profits are profits. Came in at 69% of daily goal today.

And for those of you wondering how I can comfortably cut a position size in 1/5th this is what I would say. Whether you are trading 1k or 5k nothing should change. You should make the same entries and same exits. Your risk should be the same. Nothing is changing in my methology of trading, however, I am just taking the risk of position size off the table. I am eliminating one variable till I feel we are at a place where I can re-enter full position size wise.",0

"PREDICTION: AAPL will acquire INTC‚Äôs modem division/IPThis is 75% me hoping I still have a job, but hear me out:

Apple‚Äôs known to be [opening a new office in San Diego](https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/apple-to-add-more-jobs-at-new-san-diego-tech-hub) to work on modems. While most news outlets have been reporting this is in Qualcomm‚Äôs backyard, it‚Äôs also in Intel‚Äôs backyard - Intel‚Äôs modem division (iCDG) is based out of SD.

Now that [Intel is exiting the 5G smartphone business](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-modem-statement/), this allows Apple to swoop in and acquire the entire group, fast-tracking Apple‚Äôs modem development. This deal with Qualcomm has bought Apple a six-year lifeline to develop their own modems, but six years may not be enough.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúsix years is plenty of time to make their own!‚Äù but modem development is not as simple as it sounds. Not only will Apple need to develop their own LTE/5G/NR modem, they will still need to support legacy RATs like 2G/3G/CDMA - not a trivial task. Why pour billions into R&amp;D to develop legacy tech, when they can just acquire? Intel‚Äôs key customer has been Apple anyway, so both groups are familiar with working together and each other‚Äôs methodology.

With Apple partnering with Qualcomm for the near future, but also trying to build their own modem, there‚Äòs a risk for cross-contamination and more lawsuits, so acquiring Intel‚Äôs modem division and operating them as their own unit would also alleviate these fears.

The only hiccup is Intel has specified they are only giving up *smartphone* 5G development. Would they be willing to give up their 5G IP even though they‚Äôre still probably planning on putting 5G into laptops? Or will they come out and admit they‚Äôre giving up on 5G modems all-together?

"Comparing SPY 2022 to SPY 2018...https://i.imgur.com/6BXulAC.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/xLLkiPG.jpeg

Comparing to September 2018 crash... 

9/20 high of 294. 
10/29 dip to 260= 12% dip. 
Recovery to 281 on 11/8= 8% recovery. 
Dip 263 on 11/23= Another 7% dip. 
Recovery to 280 on 12/3= 7% recovery. 
Dip to 233 on 12/27= 17% dip. 
Total dip from high= 20.8%
Eventual recover started here... 

1/4 high of 479.98
1/24 dip to 420= 12.5% dip
Recovery to 458 on 2/2= 9% recovery
Dip 443.8 on 2/4= 3.1% dip
Recovery to 457.9 on 2/9= 3.1% recovery 
Yesterday low of 425.9= 7% dip currently. 
Total dip so far= 11.3% 

Comparing the percentage of dips...
Dip 12% vs 12.5%= about the same
Recover 8% vs 9%= about the same
Dip 7% vs. 3.1= 0.5x 2018 dip. 
Recover 7% vs. 3.1= 0.5x 2018 dip
Dip 17% vs. (7%)= ?? ( 20%=383) ?? 

When we compare these we can clearly see that these charts are behaving identical to eachother. The only difference is the dip of the 2nd dip... that only dipped about 50% compared to 2018. However the chart shows the EXACT same double top pattern... 

If we look at strictly percentages... we see that we could dip an additional 10% which would put us at approximately 383... 

Now another thing to look at is the way the dip from 6 to 7 escalted in 2018... we are at a very similiar point in our chart presently. 

If we were to see an additional 4th red day today it COULD confirm that this correction is about to get that much more wild... it also shows that our 5th red candle (would be Thursday) would be a false breakout up followed by a massive sell off). 

I actually posted this breakdown of SPY now vs 2020, 2018 and 2008 crash back 20 days ago. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sj4fr8/comparing_now_to_2020_2018_and_2008_crashes/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share 

Its actually kinda scary but interesting updating these numbers and seeing how identical SPY is behaving now compared to 2018... 

Now a big fat green bullish day today that breaks the daily 8 ema/ 200 ema of 439.7 would negate all this. But none the less it is interesting to see the comparison. Especially how similiar the actual charts look. 

Note- this is more of a fun analytical Comparison to see what others think... this is absolutely not any sort of TA i would base a play off unless we continue red this week... but futures up 0.8^% and looking like going higher (currently would open us near our two major resistance of 432.76 and 433.5).",1

$35/40 by EOY???
News and shit are too nice to miss.
At 30 still undervalued if you ask me.
The coming 2 years will be great for AMD.
2020 will be next gen PS and Xbox.
Apple products with AMD CPU/GPU.
YEARS ahead of Intel's tech with all that 7nm Ryzen EPYC fuzz.
CPU and server tech is a huge billion dollar market. AMD will take away lots of it from intel in the coming months.
Etc.
Easy 50% at least till end of next year even without option and margin plays.
What do you think?
Brilliant huh?

"GOEV &amp; AAPL TALKS CONFIRMED. DEGENERATES UNITEI JUST POSTED ABOUT THIS A COUPLE DAYS AGO. DEGENERATES UNITEüöÄüöÄüöÄ. AAPL were in acquisition and partnership talks in 2020, but they fell through. Bullish as hell on this for a couple reasons:

1. If AAPL wants to buy a company out or partner with them for their 1st ever EV project, then you know the company is LEGIT

2. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract w Hyundai (expected in March) and GOEV provides their platform to Hyundai. AAPL just decided to go through Hyundai to get the platform they want... which is GOEVs

"Weekly Risk Ranges for TSLA, AAPL, SPY, QQQ, IWM, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN 

# Weekly Risk Ranges

|Ticker|Low|High|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TSLA|637.94|755.44|
|AAPL|130.83|143.43|
|SPY|376.31|403.09|

|AMZN|103.64|155.66|

&amp;#x200B;

# If this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.

Hint: in your drunken stupor have you forgotten that we're in the middle of a pandemic, getting cheques from the government, employment numbers on the rebound, and lockdown restrictions similar to the ones from last March are being reinstituted? 

Are you getting it yet? 

We can go over how the case for e-commerce has never been stronger given that we're heading into another stimulus package or how the discretionary income is being sucked up by FAANG with a force that leaves your girlfriend's boyfriend breathless and you jealous, but I'm not here to bore you with fundamentals.

""B-but sector rotation is happening and tech is having an outflow"" you say.

Why don't your greasy fingers type in NFLX into google and see how a 220B market cap company added 13% after hours on earnings that should've been priced in? Surely everyone expected Netflix to make a metric ton of cash and have record subscriber counts if everyone's sitting at home? Right? Wrong. Market's attention span is the length of your cock and everyone forgets that these companies exist until the next earnings when they blow expectations out of the water and they go on a rip again.

If only there was a company in the same market segment but also took advantage of the remaining cash that people have.

It's AMZN you hobgoblin.

It doesn't get any more obvious than this and if you have an opinion opposite to this then it's wrong. 

Amazon is positioned to take advantage of the current environment from virtually of its business segments and with with  Black Friday, Prime Day, AND Christmas in the reporting period, you bet papa Jeff is looking to reclaim the #1 spot from Elon.

"3/14/22 SPY Daily TAAh yes another day‚Ä¶ and more fuckery afoot. I know I was a victim of the mornings bullshit and got burnt by the exchanges freezing. Overall next to the GME issue that was the most BS ive seen in a while. Anyone watching and trading this morning saw the massive red candle come in breaking all the supports only to magically have the exchanges ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù and brokerages across the markets freeze and magically SPY goes on a nice bull run. 

But atlas no matter the tricks and fuckery whoever was trying to play it was not enough and we still saw another afternoon of selling. Despite the clear red day we did see the bulls end of day save this from getting anymore bloodier than it really could have if it had free rain. 

Volume today was another very interesting thing I have been watching for a few weeks. Overall the volume on the day was around 95 million total which is still about 25 mil lower than usual. The last three trading days of SPY have all been below 100mil when the average is up around 120 mil currently. 

It appears China today announced that they are going on some lockdowns for a new? Covid variant which is about the only explanation I have for why VIX opened near 31 dipped to a low of 30 around market open only to go on an absolute tear up to its peak of 33 around 245pm when we saw the bulls finally take some control. It will be interesting to see how the markets react to this throughout the week.

Tomorrow we have the first day of FOMC meeting, however, as far as I can tell (outside of leaks) there will be no information released until 2pm on WEDNESDAY. Tomorrow is the first day of the ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù from what I understand but markets should not get any news. Currentlly the first rate hike is scheduled to be released at 2pm Wednesday.  

https://preview.redd.it/0f0bm9kc2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=122e09056cbf1c9627dad6e8ad7843e3b9aa0826

What do you see when you looked at this? I see an overall big bear channel down with some intra-levels but they are all going down. This leaves room for us to trade up or down depending on the day. However, the overall trend continues since January to be downward. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jfrdj1jd2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f52f792738300375b5e7715adb8703898e670f51

Tomorrow my expected range if we have a bullish day would be to ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù near 422-423. IF SPY can get above that 423 mark it could continue to the next ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù around 428-430. 

However, If SPY has another red day tomorrow the next level down is 405 to 408. If that level fails we will finally breach into the upper 300s. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6ix6pbce2gn81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c357daf0e592f9d8f1ced2a0b820ae5e73d20758

The futures show a similar trend line. Its major support is near 4082. If it can break above 4176 over night it could see a nice gap up. However a rejection at the last diagonal dotted resistance line could result in quiet the bearish move tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/58qg4uif2gn81.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=814c28bb8482a52e72f70fbea86dc2c1a5ae1fb2

On the daily chart the first picture I highly two important candles and then the next pic is unaltered to allow you to see it more clearly‚Ä¶ what do you see here? I see two nearly identical candles and see a double bottom. Its not perfect double bottom but for a daily chart 3/8= 415.12 and today a low of 415.79‚Ä¶ well that‚Äôs a pretty dang close double bottom to me. It almost reminds me of the inverse of the two green double top candles from February 2nd and 9th. 

What do I think that means? Well personaly with that long upper wic from the morning I would NOT be surprised to see a nice gap up for futures over night and/ or a green day tomorrow. My anticipation also will be the markets running up SPY tomorrow in anticipation of FOMC being good and only a 0.25bps rate hike. I feel like lately markets love to run this up end of the day. We also finished above the midchannel support line today too, however, continuing to wic above the daily 8 ema but finishing BELOW it really is a very bearish sign. The 8 and 20 EMA are darn near 30 degree angles straight down and the 50 ema is now only $3 from the 200 EMA to complete the allusive death cross. 

For bulls to get a leg up tomorrow we need to see Futures hold its green over night and we need to see the VIX continue its end of the day sell off and breach 31 and inevitably 30. At this range a nice unwinding of the VIX would lead to a very green day. Its very possible tomorrow is green. I don‚Äôt know about 3% green but it very well could be nice and green. 

Bears need to see futures lose its current green, the vix continue back up near 33 and break this double bottom at 415. 

&amp;#x200B;

10% challenge-

Unfortunately got burnt by the market wise freeze of exchanges this morning so took a pretty big hit there. Thankfully I had only risked about 20% of my normal allotted per option amount. After that I decided to stay with my 20% of my allotted amount and I also continued to test a new indicator out. Overall still learning how it ticks but overall I am a fan. I also have no idea what happened to my TOS at the end of the day (even TOS help desk says they didn‚Äôt see it on their side) but around 3pm I was in a call. I watched on my TOS desktop a put open up randomly. My call then close out red before my eyes and the put then close out before my eyes red too. I asked TOS about it and they didn‚Äôt really have much to see about it. I have no idea what happened and have no explanation for it and neither did they. The only thing I noticed is the 15min candle had a massive quick dip and recovery at the same time. Overall not a fan. But none the less made 10 trades for 50% green and 50% red. For a total gain of 1% and a small loss. I do really need to get back to my normal one trade a day and now that I feel a little more comfortable with this new indicator I will continue to watch it. I got too cocky with it today for sure and over traded my gains away at the end of the day which is a cardinal sin. But overall tomorrow is a new day! 

I will take a small loss (which really my put was up 15% before exchanges froze this morning and ended up closing it down around 20% by time TOS ‚Äúadjusted it‚Äù for me and the fanthom put I didn‚Äôt even enter along with the call randomly closing out for me (and no im not on margin) overall not a bad day today). Everyday is a lesson.

"TSLA Upcoming 4 for 1 Stock Split - An Elon Musk Twitter AnalysisLast year Elon Musk tweeted that ""Tesla stock price is too high imo"". Most people did not think too much of this as they thought he was referring to the then recent price action. However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.

https://preview.redd.it/gd2ixiclhz571.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755c06a09499b39b429a492e67190e41478d5372

He tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1. The 5 for 1 stock split was announced on 8/11.

[Tesla Announces a Five-for-One Stock Split | Tesla Investor Relations](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split)

So why do I think he is hinting at another split? There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).

https://preview.redd.it/blo3ms45iz571.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dbbf2cc89dcd10a9a04460c47c221f67ab92f99

Besides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.

While this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to ""Elon Musk, the 2nd"" which could be referring to the second stock split.

Furthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/bw87j61djz571.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbd74f28b426161b14ac8854c257a12e030564f4

He could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.

Assuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play. Last stock split announcement saw a 13%+ rise the day after as well as an 80%+ rise between the announcement and the actual split which was roughly two weeks later.

It was the eve of FOMC and all through the markets the chop was playing out. Probability of a choppy range day was there but I did not really expect that red of a pre market. Overall I think we saw some risk come off the market today. 

Before people ask‚Ä¶. FOMC is tomorrow‚Ä¶ rate hike drop at 2pm and we are expecting a 75bps hike‚Ä¶ presser starts at 230pm‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see we are holding sentiment at a 17% chance of 100bps and a 83% chance of 75bps‚Ä¶ there isn‚Äôt even any chance we see a 50bps hike tomorrow which is interesting. 

Note- TA will be brief as much like CPI‚Ä¶ FOMC will unnaturally move the market and we will have to evaluate EOD tomorrow.

A little fun facts for you guys.. of the last four FOMCS pre market has averaged an open of 0.725% and on average FOMC closes with a green day of 2.33%+.

That means we could be expecting a pretty green pre market and from close we should look for about 392-393 close tomorrow. If we happen to get some sort of bullish hoorah from JPOW tomorrow then we could see a bigger 3-4% day. But I would be we see a 2-3% green close based on historical data.

Looking at SPY daily we have a dragon fly doji with a bullish engulfing daily followed by another dragonfly doji‚Ä¶ overall 382 is establishing itself as a stout support. We did breakdown and close back below that red dotted 50% channel retracement level tho. 

Key support- 382.2 -&gt; 378.7 -&gt; 375

Key resistance- 385.6 -&gt; 388.5 -&gt; 390 -&gt; 393.2

SPY weekly currently forming a gravestone doji. Key support remains at 380 and key resistance remains at 390.

I really would have liked to see Futures close back over 3900 today, however, it looks like it will close below 3900 and will lead to a new lower close. This is the lowest close since July 18th. 

Key support- 3830 -&gt; 3762

Apple is just that little stock that could‚Ä¶ closing as the lone green top 10 tech. It continued to look strong and break through a lot of pretty major resistances today. IT broke through key 154.5 resistance, daily 200ema, daily 8ema and broke its black bear channel. Apple is looking fairly strong here. 

Key support- 154.5 -&gt; 152.4 -&gt; 150.8

Apple weekly is really establishing 149 as support here. I will be looking for apple to continue to hold 155.9 and attempt to take out this bear channel resistance at 161.4 by EOW.

VIx continues to remain pretty unphased by everything that is happening‚Ä¶ it did close back over key 26.9 resistance and once again established 25.5 as support. Tomorrow with FOMC we should expect a small push up around 28-29 but as long as JPOW sticks to the script of 75bps and doesn‚Äôt go anything wild we should see it close back near 25.5 EOD.

Pretty great day overall. Had a bit of struggle this morning that‚Äôs for sure catching some bad bounces on those Puts. Technicals for me at least were a bit of as struggle today. We say VOLD trending in extreme bear momentum almost all day and pretty much sell off all day long. We never really saw green buying momentum to represent the bounces we were seeing. Not only that but with apple at times up 2% and spy down 1% there was a lot of divergence in the markets and the VIX was disconnected (as I mentioned most likely would be). Definitely was a struggle trading today. But came out on top.

Based on probabilities of a green open on FOMC I decided to open this call. I wasn‚Äôt going to swing calls but this play is about 10% of my normal position size so even if we go to zero its like taking a 15-20% stop loss on a normal sized played so I liked the risk‚Ä¶ Overall I will close this at open regardless of trend‚Ä¶ unless it opens red then I will wait until fomc presser at 230 and attempt to close it on the run up. 

Good luck tomorrow. Expect a lot of consolidation after an initial morning push around 1030 and possibly a retrace back to opening price before 2pm. There will be a decent IV pump tomorrow (also why I got calls) that you can play too.",0

https://wccftech.com/intel-xe-unleashed-gpu-lineup-leaked-xe-power-2-flagship-graphics-card-roadmap-and-more/

Thoughts:

66 Tflops at $699 would be devastating to anything either AMD or Nvida have on the horizon. That's equivalent to quad Titan RTXs ($10,000).

The much more interesting line though is the 32 GB 4D XPoint memory with 8TB/s bandwidth (12x faster than the bandwidth of a Titan RTX). That would explain why Micron has focused it's energy on the next generation of Xpoint and left left first gen Optane to Intel. This 4D Xpoint I am assuming will be manufactured at the Utah plant that Micron just kicked Intel out of. It would take at least a couple years for Intel to build one of it's own.

I was curious what Sanjay meant by their optimism for ""next generation memories"" in the December earnings call especially since he implied it was something other than 3D Xpoint or GDDR6. Some un-named memory and this might be what he was referring to.",0

"7-18-22 Spy/ ES Futures and AMD Daily TASo let me get this straight‚Ä¶ we had nothing but terrible news all week last week but ole Apple drops a news nugget about hiring slowing and market capitulates itself? What the actual fuck is going on around here? But to be fair it makes sense‚Ä¶. It makes sense that they would do it on a random ass day instead of when we all expected it and were all positioned for it. 

Now the question is‚Ä¶. Was this a over reaction or was this the beginning of the next big leg down? My vote? I think we bounce tomorrow and maybe once tesla reports we actually go down‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs my opinion‚Ä¶ Ta wise it could go either way. 

https://preview.redd.it/fok0jak40ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28e30b1eb997165164e0ebd3f9bcd3aca5ec195

If you look at SPY and ES futures weekly chart you can see we broke out upwards from the descending wedge which should be bullish, however, they both perfectly rejected their weekly 8ema. That rejection is actually more bearish than the resistance line break out. 

https://preview.redd.it/sprxl9q50ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271a9db03de763e23746f08626cf09190fcb016f

Now the daily charts for SPY and Es futures look pretty bearish to me. On SPY we see we nearly perfectly tapped the downward tan channels resistance line and came just short of the sideways purple resistance line too. This tells me we have more to go down. If you look at the next chart below you can see we had a similar movement on April 21st and similar sized candle red on that day. We could be seeing the next big move of the market over the next month or so if this resistance rejection holds true. 

Looking at the ES futures you see that we broke the blue dotted resistance line which would be bullish but we rejected the purple channel. You can see by the blue arrows that everytime we have hit these we have reversed course. 

https://preview.redd.it/vn8d7kx60ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8da2c39629dce6d99bfccd78b654229ca5cd6583

And then we have the vix‚Ä¶ it attempted to break back into that key 25.5 level today and even saw 25.91 at its peak today but overall I would still venture to say that the VIX is not onboard yet for the next leg down. The only reason im not saying its time to go heavy into some puts here or uvxy/ VIX calls is because of how the VIX reacted today‚Ä¶ I feel like it more naturally reacted today but it still didn‚Äôt quite spike and hold like we would have expected. I would and will be bearish longer term once we break through 26.7 VIX. 

I still think this could have easily been a market over reaction to the Apple news. If it was a over reaction then we will see a pop tomorrow and most likely see a green day tomorrow. Unless some more news about tech come out tomorrow there really isn‚Äôt anything until Tesla earnings Wednesday night that would really move the markets. I would be careful here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also would be careful until this breaks back under 20k. Hoping that a picture of it wont result in my post getting removed‚Ä¶ but I think this being so green today is a big hint of whats to come. I wont be full bear thill this breaks back under 20k and holds. 

Bull case for SPY/ ES-

Despite the big sell off today we managed to close at that key 382 support. It is an adjusted close to just slightly under 382.23 which is the daily 8ema‚Ä¶ Looking at Fridays candle we do see a possible double bottom forming here at 382 and the wicks at 380.6. The VIX has not fully committed to the next drop yet and until we really see that break and fly over 26.6 we most likely are going to hold what we got. We do have to keep in mind that today could have been a true market over reaction which we have seen time and time before. It could be argued that this new was used as a chance to fill the big gap up we had overnight and that now that the gap is filled we should reverse. 

Bear case for SPY/ ES- Markets have been looking for a reason to dump and this might finally be the reason. With a resistance line rejection of two key channels this morning with a failure to break through that is bearish. This morning even before the apple new markets had SPY pinned within a &lt;$2 range for almost the whole day till the sell off started. After blowing through key 385 support and now closing under the daily 8ema and 382 support it is only natural that we could see 378.8 to fill the gap below us. We also have a fully engulfing bear candle on the daily now

Daily support for SPY- 382 -&gt; 378.8 -&gt; 375.1 -&gt; 370.6

Daily support for ES- 3795 -&gt; 3744 -&gt; 3671

Daily resistance for SPY- 385 -&gt; 387.3 -&gt; 390.3

Daily resistance for ES- 3915 -&gt; 4020

I feel bearish long term still but short term im not ready to be bearish enough to hold anything. I would have like it better had we stopped at 385 and formed a doji at the top on all the dailys to help with a clear reversal. This fat massive candle is not quite the reversal candle we would expect. The case for both channel resistance rejection is quite strong but we haven‚Äôt had back to back trend days in a very long time and all last week no matter what happened buyers ate everything up and we even saw that today. 

Overall I see two scenarios

1) We will hold support here at 382 and back test resistance at 385. A rejection at 385 would be a more compelling top/ reversal case than we have here. I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the 388.5 resistance retested tomorrow either. If we see that then we can get not only a TRUE double top on the daily but we can also get a true tan channel resistance rejection. That would be a case for me to feel and stay feeling bearish. 

2) If we are seeing the next leg down it will start with filling the gap at 378.8. This is going to be key with what happens next. Most times a gap fills we do see a reversal so that is something we would need to keep in mind. However, if the VIX finally gets on board or we get anymore big tech bad news we might see this sell off continue. I would need VIX &gt;26.6 to believe in it though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rih5eov90ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947ffa2808f2d51357fea2154c30e4b50847a921

AMD actually looks fairly bearish here on the daily with this hanging man doji. This is the type of candle I wanted to see on ES or SPY today to really sell the top but we didn‚Äôt get it. AMD did fill their daily gap though so I would be surprised if we see a back test of support at 79.5. If that 79.5 support holds there is a pretty big case to be made for 87.2 still especially with the CHIP bill being voted on tomorrow. However, if 79.5 fails we just might see a back test of that 71.6 support. 

10% challenge-

Today was a GREAT day that I turned into a GOOD day thanks to greed and also playing it safe. All morning I hated the trend and I recognized the range super early which was great. The news broke out and I was able to get some nice plays in. I was not expecting this level of dump today and was definitely expecting this to be an over-reaction and recovery intraday especially since VIX wasn‚Äôt on board. Made some great gains and then at 2pm I made my error but going in on another 0dte OTM 381p. They burnt me with the choppiness and I finally decided to close for -41.7% after it bounced and bounce and bounced around. Little did I know had I just held on a little longer‚Ä¶ it woulda been a 6x position by EOD. 

Days like today are the hardest because its the time of day that if you just hold on long enough everything will be green. But days like today make the next day even harder. Because then we have this false safe feeling that ‚Äúwell if I just hold them imma get green.‚Äù And then we just keep holding and averaging down and it just keeps getting redder and redder until we realize we are too burn to even salvage anything. In this market we have to salvage our losses and mitigate our risk/ loss. 

Todays biggest lesson was 0dtes are still a great trade but EOD OTM 0dte are a big struggle. Had I just gone ATM like I usually do I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten burnt like that and felt the need to sell. I will not be playing these OTM again until days like FOMC when we fully expect the big move before it happens. 

Also had I just sat with my $1200 profits I would have been very happy but instead I ended up with just over $600 in profits. Tough day to trade today for sure.

Apple is screwed. The implications that come along with that type of standardization are incredibly detrimental to Apples business model. Even a simple mind can connect the dots. Without the freedom to keep making new ports and staying proprietary, thus forcing you to buy the new, they will fall hard. They will have to shift to software crashes more so than they already are, and they won't be able to command the same price for them anymore. Not to mention the cord/headphones sector will see dramatic changes too. Thus affecting huge accessory sales losses from apples standpoint and a larger share to aftermarket makers. Licensing rights income too, as they won't be able to select the aftermarket makers and then license them the right to make their cords. This will also translate into the COGS going way up as they won't be able to secure pricing on materials with smaller purchases. Thus driving that lions share of the market over to other companies.

I can already see people saying ""how did we not see that coming"", the writing is on the walls. Countless IPOs/SPACs with companies WITH NO REVENUE.

I definitely think we'll see an ER run-up back to high 170s and am willing to hold at least some of these through ER. I think all the analyst chatter about iPhone X being a flop is just creating more room for a surprise to the upside. 

Obviously the pure play is just buy infinity more calls but I'm wondering if there's some kinda spread play I could set up to make things a little less lopsided. Like if I wanted to sell some contracts how would I capture max IV?

...and I bought puts as a joke a few days ago when it started dropping like a rock from 179 and have made maybe $700 this week just cashing them out and buying a couple more cheap ones at the next lowest strike, and also picking up more calls along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

There have been major crashes in my lifetime, because the ""American Dream"" died in the 90's. I'm assuming you smooth brains have at least heard of the ***Dotcom bubble***. Maybe you're a baby and are more familiar with the ***Housing Bubble***. Well let me tell you something: next up is the ***Unicorn Extinction*** bubble!!

I love Unicorns, so much so that it's my last name and also the name of my business (totally serious) but this inevitable crash is as much a ""hypothesis"" as evolution is. But the markets seem to love and worship these billion dollar tech unicorns more than I do.

*So here's the breakdown for you retards. I even used crayons and highlighters, and I'll outline it from top to bottom and spell it out to make it really easy for you to understand. Get your kool-aid and prepare to learn something.*

What you're looking at below is ***$SPY*** which represents the S-and-P 500. Ooh letters and numbers!

You know that thing with numbers that you see on the TV sometimes? No, not the channel with the big yellow bird. You see it on that station at the bank that Mommy takes you to sometimes. It's called ""C-N-N"" and it's like REALLY boring, but you sit and drool with a dum-dum in your mouth (because that's what you are) and listen to them say things like ""The S and P is down 15 points today."" It's a bunch of silly made up words, I know. But those numbers are the reason Mommy is crying and talking to Mr banker...

Here, I'll illustrate it for you. I even used crayons and highlighters. We're going to look at the pretty picture from TOP to BOTTOM, okay?

So the lines underneath the actual stock price are moving averages (MA). They are the mean line of what a stock should be doing based upon its history. From warm colors (short term MA) to cool colors (long term MA) it's ***normal to see a bit of divergence***. However, the further apart these lines get, the more it's indicative of an ***over-valued market***, maybe so much so that it's going to be a free-fall as the bubble pops. The case I'm making for this Unicorn Extinction (*yes, I'm coining this term, and fucking some financial analyst better quote me when I'm right*) is the result of ***hyper-inflation*** (fed printers go BRRR), ***ridiculous speculation***, and ***over-valued businesses*** (mostly tech) yet again.

These moving averages have the highest divergence they've ever had!! That's not normal, and it means a price correction is coming, and it's going to be a fucking blood bath! The large green highlight is where the market SHOULD be, at least in my humble and moronic opinion.

The next box down is a Relative Strength Indicator (RSI). I won't get into the math, because 1+1=banana to you ü¶ç. Essentially ""traders"" (that's a big boy word) use this to know when a stock is over-bought or over-sold. Are you seeing a pattern on this screenshot?

The last box down, is harder to see, but this is your Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD). It essentially a mean of other Moving Average lines to indicate when a stock is going to switch directions. I'm zoomed out so far that you can't see all of the warnings, but I've circled them for you. These were the major signs that a crash was coming in the past.   You've been warned. Hope you are prepared for this next crash, and if you want to profit while others suffer (it's a bittersweet feeling) then you can do as I'm doing and short $SPY.

Also, fuck your üíéüëã and üöÄ because I already played that game. You go üåàüß∏ or get stung now bitches!! ü¶Ç

"7-19-22 SPY/ ES Futures Daily TANote- no AMD TA tonight as im gonna be continuing to focus on SPY now that we are finally getting some trendy days and hopefully they are gonna make it play nicely with us‚Ä¶

The bulls are back in town? Wow what an unbelievable day to actual watch.

Let me get this straight‚Ä¶ Yesterday 389 was like some massive wall of resistance that was nearly impossible to break through and then we proceeded to have a $8+ sell off (some will argue fueled by apple news) but now all of a sudden‚Ä¶ we are back to bull town and just have a massive $10.32 green day? Am I understanding that correctly? 

https://preview.redd.it/x108a69bdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=175faa3511afd8efed68c3ccd2e3ed85f1147a7f

The daily turned out to be hella bullish and despite a VERY good chance to close under that KEY 390.2 resistance it decided to push higher EOD and hold for a bullish close. 

Couple big things to note here‚Ä¶. 

1. We broke through the tan downward channel resistance this resistance dates all the way back to April‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs a huge break 

2. We broke through and CLOSED a candle over the 390.2 purple sideways channel resistance for the first time since June 10th.

3. We also closed a FULL candle over the daily 8 and 20ema for the first time since June 6th. 

https://preview.redd.it/39bye3bcdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e39a8fe36ee8528735e0cb3339d8faf466adec18

So here is our updated Daily chart‚Ä¶ what do you see? 

I see a MASSIVE symmetrical triangle breakout/ break down pattern forming‚Ä¶ we just bounced off support when we hit 371 and now it looks like we will go test resistance which will be near 402 with this current trajectory. Why is 402 significant? Well there is a massive gap left on the daily that dates back to June from 395.78 to 401.44. 

Lets take a look at the weekly now‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/rlkxscxddlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f4a83aa5cb7a62762e32adf7c58ac98b1101cf2

I mentioned earlier in the week the descending triangle was broken but we do have a new one we are working on right now. The interesting thing about the weekly is that this is the first time since June 6th that we have seen SPY trend over the weekly 8ema. We have cleared a crucial resistance of 389 on the weekly chat and I will be looking for 397 this week and 410-415 next week if this momentum keeps up. 

Key support for bulls tomorrow is now that 388.9 and 390.2 level. If it happens to get back tested it will be crucial that they hold it. But solidifying that support would lead to more bullish upside. However, the current support line shows that we will hold above 390.5. Bulls will be targeting 397.4 minimum tomorrow and closer to 401.6 for a true gap fill. It has been Since May 26th and May 27th that we have gotten back to back 2%+ green days. I am curious to see if we get that type of pop again tomorrow. 

Bears are going to look to break down that 390.5 support line that‚Äôs we have been trending on since the 371 support test. If they break that down they will want to see 382 support broken. 

Looking at this daily chart I was correct yesterday when I said I didn‚Äôt feel like that red candle was a true reversal candle‚Ä¶ granted I didn‚Äôt feel like we would hit that sort of green today and I really didn‚Äôt think we would break 390.2. 

https://preview.redd.it/lgi1kajedlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4da02a1f210232cac49d78eecfdbfdb8c0da40c1

Futures is looking fairly similar to SPY.. it broke its sideways purple channel and yesterday it broke the same resistance line that SPY broke intraday today‚Ä¶ chart wise it does appear ES is proceeding what SPY is going to do. 

https://preview.redd.it/0v219s5hdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ae7d4e02e1c0b87ea617d90b3d3f81352a8082b

Futures with a pretty clear trend also just like SPY. Symmetrical breakout triangle with support hit just on July 14th at 3724. Es closed a candle over 3920 for the first time since June 9th which is very bullish. I am also seeing that intraday today ES tested its daily 50ema for the first time since June 3rd. I will be watching Futures closely over night to see how it interacts with 3950. 

Bull levels to watch- 3950 √† 4000 √† 4090.

Current bull channel resistance for a break out is at 4010.

Bear levels to watch ‚Äì 3920 √† 3875 (support line for this bull run) √† 3827. 

If bulls can keep this momentum up and they can close this over the daily 50ema tomorrow of 3850 that is going to lead to some extremely bullish momentum for the end of the week and next week. However, if bears finally step back in tomorrow and reject the 50ema we might see a larger break down and back test that 3875 support which is that fails I believe we are on the path back to 3827. 

https://preview.redd.it/f2b771fidlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ff58fd7fb3ca932f61ff8633d083d7574194d5

The ES futures weekly I am very curious where we are going to go here‚Ä¶ We still have a descending wedge we are watching and looking to see that broken at the 3970 level. We are also seeing us trade over the weekly 8ema for the first time since early June. Overall you can see we have 3 major levels on ES futures right now. The bottom level is 3675, the middle level is 3905 and the upper level (our current upside target) is 4160. 

Right now we have clearly bounced off the bottom 3675 level and after what looks like 4 weeks of consolidation bouncing off this 3905 level‚Ä¶ we look ready to breakout to the upside. 

https://preview.redd.it/7nb6a40jdlc91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a66c1a6725df17f520a3bd9c46f78124b17d2c9d

And then we have the VIX‚Ä¶ this thing I just can not figure out. SPY just put in nearly a 3% green day and it acted like we just chopped at 0% all day long. The VIX essentially reacted the exact same to a -2% drop as it did a 2%+ rip. What does that mean exactly? Well I am still unsure on this to be honest. On one hand I feel the market is pretty numb to all news and I have mentioned a few times now that the 200weekly ema bounce at 363 COULD have been bottom and the vix is going to slowly unwind down. On the otherhand I feel like we are getting such wild volumes right now (watching VOLD and VOLSPD intraday) that its just trumping anything the VIX wants to do. Bullish? Or bearish? Im still unsure as next week is still going to be a hell of a big potential shit storm with I believe its 70% of SPYs earnings reporting this or next week, FOMC, and GDP‚Ä¶

10% Challenge-

Today was a tough day for me. I had a massive struggle believing in this bull day and believing we would see this strong of a bull day. For the last pretty much month we have been living in chop land. And I have relied heavily on the improbable/ probable highs and lows of the day based on IV (this is a think or swim indicator you can add to your chart). For about the last month (really until this last week) we have seen the Probable lows/ highs act as walls and they have been great levels to scalp reversals and to scalp momentum from and to. Today we hit 388 which was the probable IV low of the day and that was also resistance from yesterday. We chopped at 389.7 resistance for almost 2 hours before we finally pushed higher and we broke the improbable high of day of 391.4 around 145pm. From there we just kept rejecting and retesting this support level. I was able to get in two nice scalps here a call and a put at this level. Power hour I decided I was going to play the reversal off of 392.7 and I was expecting us being nearly $1.5 over the improbable high that we would see a reversal and a dump EOD. Of course that is not what happened. Took a hard loss on that scalp there but I still got 3 days to turn this week around to green. 

My current struggle is that for the last month‚Ä¶ really the last 6 months now‚Ä¶ we have experience this WILD reversal swings and WILD 1-2% dumps. As much as I would LOVE spy to return to a consistent market and trend I am very hesitant to expect such things from it. With the VIX seemingly plateaued at this 24-25 level the last few days everything has been volume driven. Watching VOLD and VOLSPD end of day today despite them running non stop bull all day today they really broke out EOD and drove SPY even higher. 

Perhaps we are getting back to a market where we can trust the trend and actually rely on the 8ema for support and resistance. Perhaps we‚Ä¶ for now‚Ä¶ are past these massive reversal and massive swings. I will be watching intraday tomorrow to see if we are getting back to levels where we can trust a play to run for the day instead of closing it with a quick scalp. But my lesson the last two or three days has been to trust the volume not the VIX. 

https://preview.redd.it/bffoxnqjdlc91.png?width=763&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821bec54bd51bec763654a4b8fc87048319cd881

I played a OTM Netflix (very small lotto) play today I was tempted to and should have closed it EOD but didn‚Äôt. Being that Netflix is up 7.5% right now im pretty sure she gonna be nothing at open. The guidance call on Netflix will be very interesting. But the expected move at 14%+ for Netflix today so either way unless we massively dump this was a losing trade. My one and only earnings play. 

After seeing all the bullish momentum the last two days and really the last week and the 390/ 3920 levels being broken and closed over I decided to play this call overnight. I have a feeling with Netflix beating (not that I really think they could have taken the markets down) and now with tesla tomorrow night we will get one more bull day. 

I honestly think a 401.5 gap fill is possible tomorrow‚Ä¶ it would be a 2.4% green day for SPY. I would not be surprised to see a gap up tomorrow either and a 1%+ green open for SPY. 

We left the 379.05 to 380.54 and 369.38 to 370.18 gaps down below. My thoughts are we are finally going to fill this 401.5 gap and then we can position ourselves bearishly for the next week. It‚Äôs the perfect storm‚Ä¶ bull week leading into the black swan week.

"3/31/22 Spy Daily Ta3/31/22 SPY Daily TA 

Well that was one of the wildest and craziest power hours I have seen in a long ass time. That reminded me of the days we used to have back in January where we would see SPY make wild 1%+ moves in an hour. Last time we had volume of 121mil/ day and movement like this was the start of the bear market back in January. Could April showers bring sorrows and bear arrows? 

https://preview.redd.it/gpal863gctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae1558cc49d0e8655d53d5f897a50cf7307e92f3

Despite the essentially flat pre-market we saw quickly entering the intraday this morning we saw spy establish a bear trend with candles below the 8ema. And that is pretty much where we stayed all day. We saw a nice dip to 456.6 at open that led to a recovery to 458.76 around 11am. That morning recovery should have been everyone signal to buy puts for the end of the day as all the signs of a dip fill to 455.91 and potentially even a dip near 454 were clear and present around mid day. However, due to the wild reversals we have had the last two weeks we had to play it safely and unfortunately missed out on some incredible gains. 

However, end of the day brought the fire works. Start of power hour we saw the shake out fake rip to 457.36 before we saw spy jump off a cliff with one of the wildest power hours ive seen that took us to a low of 451.16 before finally closing at 451.63. That is an incredible 1.37% dip in one hour. Considering our intraday range was $2.7 till about 245pm the fact that SPY covered over $3 in an hour is quite impressive. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gzz5hzygctq81.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88eae5847685c5a055a4c5717c596f8bf3fc86d1

Now that we have potentially ‚Äúpeaked‚Äù we will look at the downside levels that have not been in play for almost 3 weeks. 

The next levels down support wise (major supports) are 450 ÔÉ† 446 ÔÉ† 443 ÔÉ† 436

The next major resistance will be 459.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently we are also see two channels‚Ä¶ the dotted channel that I refer to as the levels which support is intraday tomorrow would be 450 and resistance would be 458.5.

https://preview.redd.it/k7hb4p3ictq81.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1dad19dca701e7b16c851b91635d1ab90d34a0e

The solid line downward channel puts resistance at 455 and support down near 447. 

https://preview.redd.it/seizqg1jctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69717795b1650eb859a89204d9457801c930a7f0

The daily candle close today is quite telling if you ask me. It closed BELOW the daily 8ema for the first time Since March 15th which you guessed it was the first green day of this massive two week long bull run we just went on. While the candle body is only below the 8ema if bears can gap this down tomorrow we just may see a full close below the 8ema which is very bearish. 

Also of note is the fact that this is the first candle closed below fully below the mid point of the grey channel we have been trading within. That tells me the bulls finally lost momentum today. Support of the channel tomorrow would be at 452.5 any movement below that and we have officially broken the bull channel. That means bulls have to gap this up tomorrow and keep her green all day. 

This is also the first back to back red days since the March 14th bottom. 

Todays volume at 122mil was the highest volume since you guessed it March 14th. Which that candle volume was 144mil and started the incredible bullrun we just went on. 

With a new month starting tomorrow and monthly expire that took place today, along with the massive end of day sell off there is a very real possibility that the bear market dead cat bounce is being confirmed and we will now start pushing back to 420 range. 

As much as I would like to tell everyone go buy 30dte puts and youll be rich‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt trust anyone at all. I don‚Äôt trust the MM not to run this back to ATH next week. The worst part about this bullrun we just had the last 2 weeks is that I will not be fully convinced of a bear market dead cat bounce until its too late to even capitalize on it properly. 

However, once the bears (if they truly are back in control) can get SPY back under the daily 200 ema at 439.33 I will then be convinced we are going to retest the 410-420 lows. However, at that point I would be waiting for a 410 retest. If 410 was to hold and see a convincing double bottom I would be looking for some 2-3year LEAPS to purchase. If 410 was to break I would still fully expect a dip near 380. 

The VIX intraday saw a spike to 21.5 after being pretty flat all day between 19.5 and 20.5. With the vix closed above 20.5 And spy well below where it was the last time VIX was at 20.5 if the vix continues to trend back up we just might see some more downside. As always all eyes on the VIX. It did not lead us astray today or at all this week.  

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4bl5ee9kctq81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72e4409b6f0832658d580b1f8048c90bfeedfe01

As you guys know I strongly believe Apple is a gateway into what SPY will do and their correlation is very strong. Looking at the daily chart of Apple we see a similar set up. It closed a candle below the mid support of the channel for the first time in 2 week and saw now back to back red days for the first time in two weeks. Apple however was able to keep its close above the daily 8ema at 173.55. I fully anticipate apple to start heading back down and break its daily 8ema tomorrow too. With the RSI now in a downtrend I will be keeping all my eyes on Apple tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

10% daily challenge-

Today was another great day of trading in the server. I probably had one of the best weeks I have had since January so far. 

I made 4 total trades today. 

A 0dte put at open for 10% gain. 

A 0dte put that I had to hold all the way to -50% before I was finally able to average down and secure a 20% gain on. 

A 4dte put during power hour that I tapped for 25% which of course ran to well over 100% at close. But after greed killed my gains on Monday and obviously no one knowing we were going to dump that far (I fully expected 454 but not 451‚Ä¶) I had to secure profits and then I was out of buying power by that time. 

I also played a 8dte Apple put that I was going to hold over night (had bought around 230pm before it broke its support) but ended up selling before close for 45% gain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall another great trading day. 

Going into tomorrow im currently sitting just under 3x my weekly profit goal and I am going to be very patient and not erase all my gains this week. Being a Friday I have no idea what to expect but the last few Fridays have been quite great trading days for me. I do know the last week every morning trading session has been nothing but chop and tight $2-$3 ranges before we finally make a massive end of day move. I will be patient and I will make my moves count. After 3 days in a row of nearly making my weekly profits in one day im gonna stay humble and not get greedy.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&gt;Stocks fell as another major chipmaker's downbeat outlook fueled recession fears, with many traders unwilling to take any risks ahead of Wednesday's crucial inflation reading.  
&gt;  
&gt;A rally that pushed the S&amp;P 500 up more than 10% from its June lows hit a snag on the fourth day of losses. The Nasdaq 100 fell after Micron Technology issued a warning, adding to evidence of chip demand collapsing. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 4.6%, with all 30 companies falling. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Gamestop sputtered as a result of the surge in meme shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;Investors have become more cautious ahead of the July consumer-price index, which is expected to cool slightly while remaining high. The report will follow recent job data highlighting solid wage growth and US productivity data highlighting another surge in labour costs, which could complicate the Federal Reserve's efforts to control inflation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Timing the peak in inflation is difficult, especially after June's CPI print was hotter than expected, but being correct has brought investors a handsome return.  
&gt;  
&gt;According to data compiled by the Leuthold Group, those who purchased the S&amp;P 500 at major inflation peaks dating back to 1940 saw the index rise 16% on average over the next 12 months. A significant caveat is that the price-to-earnings ratio has previously averaged 12.7 on a normalised basis, compared to above 20 now.

# If this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.

So I thought I‚Äôd share. TL;DR is basically the last paragraph.

Positions: [https://i.imgur.com/SZJ85tT.png](https://i.imgur.com/SZJ85tT.png)

Here's the deal. TSLA has been wildly fluctuating between about 180 and 380 for most of the past few years as investors swing between being sure Elon is an unstoppable genius and being unsure of his ability to actually make money. The latter seems to be dependent on three factors: Tesla's ability to make cars, maintaining a high margin, and the promise of full self-driving. 

The Tesla factory in Fremont has been steadily increasing production, and the China factory has just begun production. They have stated a target of 500,000 vehicles produced globally in the 12 month period ending June 30, 2020. The Shanghai factory will be able to produce cars much cheaper than the Fremont factory and will help mitigate any tariff issues, making the car cheaper for China, the world's largest auto market. Model Y crossover will be available in North America in the summer of 2020 and should be a relatively easy production ramp considering the carryover of Model 3 components and production lines. Crossovers are a huge segment and this vehicle should have plenty of orders, increasing demand well past the current \~400k/year production rate and closer to the higher rate they should be capable of at the end of 2020. Also, Musk tweeted that the pickup truck will be unveiled later this year, and supposedly they will begin delivering some semi-trucks next year.

Musk is ""certain"" that Tesla will be ""feature complete"" on full self-driving this year, and that drivers will be able to use full self-driving around the middle of 2020. This seems like a stretch, and he's given dates for this in the past that have come and gone, so, you know, grain of salt.

But, let's be optimistic. Let's ask: what is a probable valuation of Tesla if things go very well? Let‚Äôs imagine this future: By the end of 2020, they are approaching a million cars per year run rate. Model Y production ramp went well and they‚Äôre slowly taking over the huge global crossover market. Cars are flying out of the China factory at impressive gross margins. The solar and battery storage side is pulling in some good money with all those solar roofs and industrial grid solutions that are selling like hotcakes thanks in part to California having an inept power company. Full self-driving still hasn‚Äôt hit because Musk was wrong about the timing again, but they have been so aggressive and enough progress has been made that they are the clear leader. Waymo is still fucking around in the desert.

In January 2021, Tesla will be worth, I don't know, $120 Billion. That puts the share price at $666. The new Roadster starts at $200k. But, to get $200k, I need to get more money because taxes. How much do I need? About $350,000. I put my $15,000 into fourteen Jan 2021 calls: four at $350 (yolo) and ten at $440 (YOLO). At $666 per share that gives me $350,000. I did this a few months ago so as of today I‚Äôm up $26k. Imma let it ride all the way to my $15k Roadster.",1

"Long $AMD, Massive Intel In-Hardware Security Bug Found (Hotfix Requires -30% Perf Penalty)You faggots doubted SuBae, but her journey to the moon is undaunted by your cum-guzzling ways. 

Confirmed homosexual firm, $INTC, will be announcing [a massive in-hardware security bug in its modern processors that will require a **-30% performance penalty** to hotfix it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7nl8r0/intel_bug_incoming/). This will notably affect large datacenter customers such as $GOOG and $AMZN (short them for maximum tendies). 

* As an in-hardware bug, this is not easy to fix and will require a brutal hotfix as a temporary measure. A less destructive fix will not be available until the hardware is replaced with updated models in the coming years (as if customers would choose to buy more $INTC products after this!). 

* The bug is currently under embargo much like $INTC is still officially in the closet. In the coming days, $INTC will publicly acknowledge its sexual orientation and the existence of this bug. 

* [$INTC's CEO sold off $11M of $INTC stock less than two weeks ago](https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/12/19/intels-ceo-just-sold-a-lot-of-stock.aspx) and now holds the bare minimum number of shares required by the CEO according to $INTC by-laws. Looks like he's getting his yacht while he still can! 

* Competing processors made by SuBae are confirmed to not be affected by this vulnerability as their architecture is much girthier. 

This leaves **SuBae poised to fuck the competition up the ass** on large datacenter contracts. 

* $AMD has recently [ramped up production on their 32-core ""EPYC"" CPU](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12032/amd-announces-wider-epyc-availability-and-rocm-17-with-tensorflow-support) that competes in the datacenter market. 

* Not only does the 32C EPYC have more cores than $INTC's flaccid 28C CPU, but [EPYC costs half as much](https://www.anandtech.com/show/11544/intel-skylake-ep-vs-amd-epyc-7000-cpu-battle-of-the-decade/10). 

* SuBae is rumored to release an [EPYC 2.0 with an even more turgid 64-core CPU as early as 2019](https://hothardware.com/news/amd-epyc-2-64-cores-128-threads-and-256mb-l3-cache). 

 * Impotent traitor, [Raja Kodorki, is confirmed to not be involved with Epyc in any way](http://www.pcgamer.com/amd-radeon-boss-raja-koduri-joins-intel-to-work-on-integrated-and-discrete-graphics/) and will only be adding performance issues to $INTC products going forward.

More details in the full text of the below Bloomberg article for the few of you whose attention span exceeds 10 seconds. I **bolded** the important parts.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-31/gamestop-short-nightmare-shows-few-signs-of-becoming-a-contagion?sref=2CO9MdgW](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-31/gamestop-short-nightmare-shows-few-signs-of-becoming-a-contagion?sref=2CO9MdgW)

# GameStop Short Nightmare Shows Few Signs of Becoming a Contagion

[GameStop Corp.‚Äôs](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GME:US) surge has struck fear into anyone caught on the wrong side of its ascent. But those **bearish positions probably aren‚Äôt big enough to lay low the larger universe of investment funds**.

That‚Äôs the view of Barclays Plc strategists led by Maneesh Deshpande. By plotting the value of bearish equity bets versus the whole market‚Äôs capitalization, they found that short sales have actually dwindled during the past year to the lowest level since at least 2008. Moreover, those **most-heavily shorted companies targeted by day traders this year had bearish wagers amounting to less than 0.001% of the $43 trillion market.**

Whether losses being suffered by hedge funds and other money pools will be large enough to ignite a full-blown contagion was a concern that arose several times during last week‚Äôs selling -- the worst in the S&amp;P 500 since October. For now, while Reddit-fueled stock jocks may have drowned out every other narrative, they‚Äôre unlikely to completely subsume the bull market.

 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre witnessing a nearly unprecedented amount of speculative activity. But on the other hand, **we are talking about a very narrow group of stocks that don‚Äôt have an outsize influence**,‚Äù said Marshall Front, chief investment officer at Front Barnett Associates. ‚Äú**The underlying fundamentals of the economy are strong. A very aggressive and accommodative policy by the Federal Reserve is still intact. Together, they help the stock market on the way up**.‚Äù

Burned by short sales going against them, hedge funds have yanked money from the market at one of the fastest rates on record. The most-shorted stocks rallied 14% last week as a group, dealing the biggest blow to short sellers since last April, a [Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) basket shows.

While the **S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 3% last week, traders described the broad market as orderly**. To JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.‚Äôs strategists including Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, the retreat is likely a ‚Äúshort-lived technical tumble.‚Äù With earnings improving and U.S. consumers strengthening, this pullback is another opportunity to add stocks, particularly those geared toward an economic recovery, the strategists wrote in a Friday note.

 To be sure, day traders are targeting companies favored by bearish investors, trying to spur squeezes. In 2021, the top quintile of the Russell 3000 stocks with the highest short sales as a percentage of their float is up 20%, compared with a loss of 0.8% for the bottom 600, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But those returns are also consistent with a contour that was already taking shape as investor risk appetite increased: gains in companies with shakier finances, which had trailed during 2020‚Äôs pandemic market.

‚ÄúAlthough the short squeeze started with GME, it appears to be spreading to a wider range of stocks,‚Äù Deshpande at Barclays wrote in a note Friday, referring to GameStop‚Äôs ticker. ‚ÄúWhile we expect some more deleveraging, ultimately the scale of the problem appears quite limited.‚Äù

By Barclays‚Äôs tally, **short sales totaled $800 billion, or roughly 2% of the total market value of American equities, a sign that short sellers have not extended themselves**. The heavily shorted companies -- those with interest making up more than 20% of their share float -- saw $40 billion of their stock sold short, or 5% of the total pool of bearish bets.

‚ÄúWe remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,‚Äù Deshpande said. ‚Äú**The bottom line is that while the pain could continue in the short term, the risk of a full-fledged contagion remains low**.‚Äù",1

The daily chart makes it pretty obvious that it's bottomed out.   3180 has been a crucial level many times in the past.  This level is also the point of control, which is where most of the volume has occurred in recent history.  These high volume areas are institutional buying.

&amp;#x200B;

We probably should have corrected more this week, at least to the 50 day moving average for SPY.  That would've been healthy, and it seemed like it tried to every day.  If you made money this week, well done, because I definitely got trapped.  Microsoft just kept popping, along with the rest of big tech except for AMZN.  The fact that every dip was bought up like nothing(especially Monday, what the fuck was that shit) means were probably going higher.  But big tech, the linchpin of the financial world right now, is stretched pretty thin with the exception of AMZN.  I think MSFT cools off next week, and AMZN pumps to keep us painfully churning here.

So I thought I‚Äôd share. TL;DR is basically the last paragraph.

Positions: [https://i.imgur.com/SZJ85tT.png](https://i.imgur.com/SZJ85tT.png)

Here's the deal. TSLA has been wildly fluctuating between about 180 and 380 for most of the past few years as investors swing between being sure Elon is an unstoppable genius and being unsure of his ability to actually make money. The latter seems to be dependent on three factors: Tesla's ability to make cars, maintaining a high margin, and the promise of full self-driving. 

The Tesla factory in Fremont has been steadily increasing production, and the China factory has just begun production. They have stated a target of 500,000 vehicles produced globally in the 12 month period ending June 30, 2020. The Shanghai factory will be able to produce cars much cheaper than the Fremont factory and will help mitigate any tariff issues, making the car cheaper for China, the world's largest auto market. Model Y crossover will be available in North America in the summer of 2020 and should be a relatively easy production ramp considering the carryover of Model 3 components and production lines. Crossovers are a huge segment and this vehicle should have plenty of orders, increasing demand well past the current \~400k/year production rate and closer to the higher rate they should be capable of at the end of 2020. Also, Musk tweeted that the pickup truck will be unveiled later this year, and supposedly they will begin delivering some semi-trucks next year.

Musk is ""certain"" that Tesla will be ""feature complete"" on full self-driving this year, and that drivers will be able to use full self-driving around the middle of 2020. This seems like a stretch, and he's given dates for this in the past that have come and gone, so, you know, grain of salt.

But, let's be optimistic. Let's ask: what is a probable valuation of Tesla if things go very well? Let‚Äôs imagine this future: By the end of 2020, they are approaching a million cars per year run rate. Model Y production ramp went well and they‚Äôre slowly taking over the huge global crossover market. Cars are flying out of the China factory at impressive gross margins. The solar and battery storage side is pulling in some good money with all those solar roofs and industrial grid solutions that are selling like hotcakes thanks in part to California having an inept power company. Full self-driving still hasn‚Äôt hit because Musk was wrong about the timing again, but they have been so aggressive and enough progress has been made that they are the clear leader. Waymo is still fucking around in the desert.

In January 2021, Tesla will be worth, I don't know, $120 Billion. That puts the share price at $666. The new Roadster starts at $200k. But, to get $200k, I need to get more money because taxes. How much do I need? About $350,000. I put my $15,000 into fourteen Jan 2021 calls: four at $350 (yolo) and ten at $440 (YOLO). At $666 per share that gives me $350,000. I did this a few months ago so as of today I‚Äôm up $26k. Imma let it ride all the way to my $15k Roadster.",1

If I zoom out a little bit, the growth case for TSLA is still very much far from peak and the current macroeconomic/ environmental policy conditions are still unrealized catalysts to be priced in. (Ie, the recent decision of the EU body to ban the production of cars that run on fossil fuel from 2030 onwards). 

What do you folks think? If I'm long on TSLA is this a good time to start DCAing or should I seat on it for a couple more months?

I mentioned on Friday that I didn‚Äôt suspect we would open and just straight drill and we were until the last seconds before open holding fairly green as I suspected. However, the bears once again took control today. 

https://preview.redd.it/9lnd67mqwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0326a22e9e8cba3398838df587977958f1f5bb55

Today we finally saw the 13 week long recovery support line from the June low/ v-bottom break on SPY. This is the same trend line we saw break last Friday on Apple. 

With this trend line broken AND bears finally closing a candle below 391 support and also breaking down to 388.42 intraday today I am officially bearish. I am also bearish due to CPI and FOMC that are coming up soon. Lets talk chart technical and then end of this I will tell you why I am bearish fomc/ cpi and what position I am in because of it. 

SPY daily has a nice falling wedge forming right now (black solid lines) this falling wedge gives us a support tomorrow at 387.8 and a resistance of 394.1 (todays HOD). There are fairly high odds that we will see this falling wedges support broken later this week. 

Key resistance now will remain at 391 tomorrow as that is the major daily resistance level that we have to watch and that took 3 trading days to finally close below. 

We are still trading within that red bear channel which gives support tomorrow at 382 (-2.2% from close) and gives resistance of 401.1 (+2.6%). Until we see the red bear channel resistance line broken I would hesitate to go long here on calls especially since we broke into the 380s today. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1mmct0yrwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=195cc8322cde079120a0bd5769f9bd5fe0b6218c

Spy weekly we did perfectly hold support on that 13 week long weekly bull support line, however, in later you see that Apple and Futures both broke this support so SPY should be to follow next. I mentioned that we should play level to level on SPY now. With the 390 level being breached and the 380s being seen for the first time since middle of July we now are set up in the current trajectory to see 360s-370s by end of September. 

Key support is now 390.3 on the weekly chart from there the next major support is 367.1 which is the weekly 200ema. The weekly 200ema is where we bounce aggressively off in June. 

Key resistance will be at 396.5 for this week followed by 402.2. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3gdpc7jswam91.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0151ca831620d5e19da8910bd7671d04c862fa0b

Similar story as you may expect with futures. We broke under 3900 today for the first time since July 19th. However, as of now the bears were unable to close under key support of 3900. We did see a break down of the 13 week long v-bottom bull support line today also. This should lead to a bearish movement going forward. 

Key supports to watch is 3900 -&gt; 3883 (the black solid falling wedge) -&gt; 3865 -&gt; 3816.

Key resistance to watch is 3925 -&gt; 3944 (black falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 4025.

Here is that weekly futures support line breakdown I was speaking about above. With this line being broken that is incredibly bearish longer term. With this support line being broken this gives rise to test support at 3827 and 3676 (weekly 200ema). I will be watching for futures to finally close under 3900 this week and that will be the longer term signal that 3600s are coming again. 

Key resistance remains at 4000 this week. Until this week breaks 4000 I will remain bearish.

Apple actually had a fairly bearish day today now only short term but long term. With a close below the daily 200ema for the first time since July this should be a very bearish omen for the future.

Key support remains at 153.2 (falling wedge black solid lines) and then 150 (-3%) for the red bear channel support. 

Key resistance is 156 (black falling wedge resistance line) and then 160.3 (+3.6%) for the red bear channel resistance.

The Apple charts weekly is actually kinda crazy to look at. When you think about the fact that Apple really has survived the best of all the stocks out there (for the most part) its natural that it has the most downside to expect too. The weekly is in a clear downward cycle that looks just like March. With this current downward channel I can expect a possibility that Apple COULD reach 120s by October on the current trajectory. 

With the weekly 13 week long bull support line being broken I fully anticipate further downside on Apple the rest of the week and month.

The VIX continues to find support and continues to make new highs. Today we actually made a new recent high again. We backtested the 8ema support and also 25.5 support and held that. We also managed to close over key 26.8 resistance from last week. The VIX appears to be on a trajectory for 30+ which makes a lot of sense when you factor in CPI next Tuesday the 13th and FOMC in 15 days on the 21st. 

Speaking of CPI and FOMC‚Ä¶ let me tell you how I am positioned and how I am playing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zcjyz82wwam91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b77648d58ea96c5c1af5bc0885afb1382e7c0588

I alerted this today and here is why. This is the week before CPI and historically (you guys know I love my historic trends) there is usually a 2 days sell off prior to CPI. In the past 5 CPIs we are actually averaging a total drop of about 2.5% over the two days leading up to CPI. In addition the week before CPI (which is also next week) is averaging a intraweek drop of -2.86% through the week with two of those having a 5%+ drop. If you don‚Äôt factor in the last FOMC (the only time we were green the week before FOMC) then we are actually averaging a -4.23% drop the week prior to FOMC. 

With this info you can see how it‚Äôs a pretty good odds that we are going to see a sell off EOW here and next week should be red due to the historical trend. Now here is something even more suspicious about this CPI‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/grz1ir8xwam91.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5bfbfd1fe43a7d4f33266440c9b58839ce298d1

Historically the CPI forecast and consensus is released well ahead of the actual CPI reading. The last CPI I know they released CPI about 2-3 week before the physical CPI reading happened. I know in the last there were times it was released just shortly after the previous CPI also. The fact that there is no release of this CPI, the president says inflation hasn‚Äôt peaked, technically month over month CPI was 0% so it too didn‚Äôt drop just didn‚Äôt go up, all the fed members screaming inflations not peaked, and daddy JPOW himself at the Jackson hole saying inflation hasn‚Äôt peaked and rate hikes haven‚Äôt stopped‚Ä¶ I have a feeling this consensus/ forecast has purposefully not been released yet. I think when they release it the number is going to be way higher then the previous 8.5% and when that happens markets are going to panic and we are going to see a very similar June 8th to June 13th CPI drop of 10% in 5 days. 

I personally believe we are seeing the bear storm forming and the eye of the hurricane is here right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0u9rbloxwam91.png?width=956&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a397c362a7209e670933ad81973cf1a950eaec22

I opened this put today. I will hold this put until we break the red resistance of this bear market. If we test and reject the red resistance line I will average this put down. Otherwise I will let this one ride. 

I tactfully chose September 21st expiration as that is the FOMC meeting and my goal would be to close this either the Friday before FOMC or the day before FOMC depending on how markets have behaved and reacted to CPI. Another potential take profits are will be 370 as that will be a major support line too.

After last weeks frustration I decided to go down to about a $1000/ position with a -20% stop loss and a 20% take profit set on all orders. I also watch the stochs and whenever I see the stochs hit overbought (if im in call) or over sold (if in puts) on the 1min when im scalping I exit no matter where I am profit wise. 

Today was a much needed day for me mentally. The biggest change I made today though besides a slightly smaller position size was that I no longer hesitated in a play. I often found myself waiting and waiting and waiting for all the confirmations only to find I missed the bigger move. Today when I saw the setup and the trend aligned with my strategy I didn‚Äôt let fear stop me from entering. If it met my criteria I entered and it worked really well for me today. I truly look forward to the rest of the week trading now.

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to January 2018 to now: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/JZLDPhfi/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/JZLDPhfi/)

Weekly picture: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/Gd0frAGx/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Gd0frAGx/)

&amp;#x200B;

And now we zoom into where we are: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/tyd6LiKw/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tyd6LiKw/)

You can see SPY pulled back to make sure the breakout was legit (blue arrows). You can see that we're in new territory and SPY is establishing new support/resistance lines. So if SPY pulls back, wait and see how SPY does at those lines. (Please add an ""ish"" to the end of those three numbers on the chart. For example, 297.20ish). 

&amp;#x200B;

Some thoughts: 

**1) Don't call the top and buy puts like a dumb auti until SPY falls back into the shaded box, imo. \*\*295\*\* The trend is UP right now, people!** If SPY drops below 295, you might try puts because the fall may accelerate. Otherwise, if you're buying puts, (presumably) you're just trying to make money on scalping technical pullbacks (which is difficult but legit and what we all try to do every day (think of ROKU all year). 

Note: **for SPX,** the main key battle line is 2954, imo. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hsCuGL3f/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hsCuGL3f/)

Unlike many others, I am not of the view that SPY 234 must be retested. 

**2) IWM.** SPY and QQQ have been making new ATH's in this raging bull market. Why is IWM lagging so hard? I think it is because small caps are more dependent on debt, and so until there is an OFFICIAL rate cut announced, IWM will lag. But it's gonna fucking FLY when/if a rate cut is officially announced. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/hLQfGz0v/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hLQfGz0v/)

The absolute key number for IWM is 160. If it breaks 160 into 161, it will FLY FLY FLY (imo).

 **3) AAPL:**  Think of a ticker that hasn't reached a new ATH yet in this raging bull market.... AAPL! sexy gap fill at 210.32

"8-1-22 Spy/ ES Futures and Apple Daily TaWelcome to a new month of trading! So far August is showing a bit of a change of pace compared to July. Perhaps the tides are changing? 

Today was one hell of a choppy, indecisive and volatile day. I would call this a range day but its not the smooth normal range days we are used to. A lot of these candles were left with some massive wicks and filled with volatile reversals and indecisions. 

So where are we at?

https://preview.redd.it/8d4jgh1fw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c31940de583b86eab40a4dd61f3fc9ebce86045

https://preview.redd.it/e6r958wfw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf72f69a27f2ebc505cf64c2b65aec1cb5c7b331

Looking at the SPY/ ES daily charts we got a couple important things to note. 

On SPY the daily candle did wick through the downward bear channel resistance, however, on ES we had a clear rejection of resistance. Channel resistance for ES remains at 4142 for tomorrow. 

Despite a weaker day and closing red the bulls were able to hold the 100ema and even avoided a true retest of that support. SPYs daily candle finished as a large bodied gravestone doji while you could consider ES futures daily either a dragonfly doji or a hanging man depending on how you analyze it. 

SPY daily candle is bearish while ES is neutral to bullish, however, with the ES channel resistance rejection I favor bearish there. 

As you can see on SPY I have highlighted some horizontal levels that we have historically this year traded within. Currently we are visiting that 405.3 to 417.2 levels. If you look at May 27th to June 8th it appears we could be preparing to enter a similar level of consolidation. This consolidation could lead to the next leg down or up with 405 and 417 being those key levels to watch for direction. 

The 417 level is going to be protected heavily by the daily 200ema and that will be quite the resistance for bulls to break and hold over, while by time we get to it the daily 8ema will be closer to that 405 level and also will add some downside support/ protection and the daily 100ema at 407.5 should provide some heavier support also. 

Overall daily chart wise I will be watching for range/ consolidation and prepared to play the level to level chop like I did today. Until we see the daily 100ema or daily 200ema break I am not apt to chose an overall direction. 

https://preview.redd.it/twterangw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9786a3823c46ab0759908677e68f0a09ede7016

https://preview.redd.it/pgdenighw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e27e2430efb5a070061104a2947db0521933145a

SPY/ ES weekly you can see we did break out of the bear channel, however, historically about the time w break the channel is about the time we are seeing the top and start our week of consolidation. So that is something to bear in mind. Overall the SPY 415 and ES 4160 levels are going to be very key resistance levels to watch this week. If we see a pretty clean rejection there going into next week (much like the week of May 31st and June 6th) I will be apt to play some downside going into next week. 

Bulls need to defend the now 8 week long bull channel support at SPY 400 and ES 4018. Overall this support is also the weekly 8emas for both. An intraweek support bounce here and pushing further up before end of the week would be bullish going into next week. 

https://preview.redd.it/1x97im2iw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23aca5365443d9fac728e1f719253ec938d65206

Overall Apple is the most bearish of them all and as I alerted today at the 163.59 HOD rejection that Apple is the best put play between SPY and Apple. That rejection today locked in my opinion an extremely bearish week ahead for Apple. 

https://preview.redd.it/93yf23niw5f91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b006f87c503fad3a288e27ffe30ead4b52d775

Todays daily candle is a double top and it is also a large gravestone doji. This candle should be the reversal/ downside indication many need to go long on some puts for the gap fill. As I mentioned last week apple had one of the largest gaps in many years left of the daily. I was also mentioning the weekly and how it was looking for a weekly channel rejection‚Ä¶ well today we got that confirmed rejection. 

I will be looking for apple to back test support and gap fill this week. 

Key supports will be the weekly bull channel support/ daily 8ema at 157. And the gap just so happens to be at 157.64‚Ä¶ almost too perfect of a bounce area. Level and daily channel support comes in around that 157 level also. I would be surprised to not see some 8/5 or 8/12 ATM puts print nicely on this gap fill. 

Once the apple gap fills I do suspect there to be a nice bounce unless it flies through 157 and see 155 level. A break of the 155 level would be a bear omen and could lead to the next market sell off.

In my opinion this whole year apple has led and predicted the direction of where SPY and the markets were going. 

&amp;#x200B;

10% challenge-

I had an extremely frustrating week last week and spent a lot of the weekend reflecting and back testing a few different strategies to improve my trading. This week I decided to make a few adjustments to my trading and indicators and here they are.

\- i am now watching the 1min/ 5min chart with heikin ashi candles with a 20/ 50 ema following it. Intraday today the 1min HA candles with the 20/50ema was the best and most responsive. The 5min with the 20/50ema was great but a very lagging indicator. 

\- i am no longer tracking the VIX live for entries. I used to heavily track the VIX and momentum there to confirm the direction of SPY. With the low VIX and overall detachedness of VIX/ SPY I no longer feel the need to do so. 

\-I have no added my daily and weekly levels to my 15min chart I watch all day (level highlighted with purple and red thick lines). I think often times I was getting too lost in the noise of the the 15min candles, especially on days like today, and mixing the bigger picture level to level moves. Overall this was highly successful. 

\-focusing on limiting entries for better profits on less entries. Less is more. 

\-cutting all losers hard stop at 20%. No more letting losers become massive losers. 

\-Relying on the probable and improbable IV levels as a better guide of when to and note to enter. The higher and closer to the improbable HOD the less likely hood I am to enter unless we have hella strong momentum and volume. 

Overall today was a great day‚Ä¶ had one L on a bad fake out reversal that had I held woulda been very profitable but I was happy to cut the L and still turn in a profit for the day. 

https://preview.redd.it/8v2j6pujw5f91.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7042a625f4e04a5353558bfe7d06c3984dd855

Biggest lesson of the day? Sometimes its better to just stop after 1 or 2 trades‚Ä¶ had I just stopped after my first two trades and I even had talked about it in my server I would have finished with about 3x the profits I finished with today. 

Every position we should be weighing risk to reward but we can not be scared to enter just to protect or win rate either. Day trading is a massive struggle of risk and reward. Some days the risk outweighs the reward but today it did not.",0

"TATTOO FOR AMD TENDIES OFF EARNINGS WEEK (WSB TATTOO IF AMD 100+)Yup, you read it right. If AMD hits 100+ by 02/09/2020, I will be getting a tattoo of the WSB LOGO on my chest.

 https://imgur.com/gallery/5LhXeTZ 

After edging ATHs of close to $100 on January 11th, AMD took a massive dump the following week and dropped below 90 dollars. Much of this was due to Intel's appointment of a new CEO as the market viewed this leadership change as a negative to AMD's stock price. BMO capital downgraded AMD's price and the stock fell nearly 10% in a week. 

If you weren't retarded, you took this drop as a buying opportunity, as earnings day is coming next Tuesday (1/26/2020). With AMD poised to shit on earning expectations, AMD is looking to runup on the days before earnings. The high anticipation of a strong 4th quarter combined with the high IV will drive up premium prices, as the releases of the new consoles that utilize AMD PS5 and XBOX series X were smashing hits. Additionally, when you take in that PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade, and that the notebook market share is growing by 50%, the demand for AMD has never been higher. 

[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/20/amd-is-hammering-intel-in-this-critical-area/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/20/amd-is-hammering-intel-in-this-critical-area/)

""Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann expects AMD's CPU market share to jump to 50%¬†in 2021. That would be a big increase over the 22.4% market share it was sitting on at the end of the third quarter of 2020, as per Mercury Research. And as the company seems keen on improving its ASP, a higher market share will ideally result in stronger top- and bottom-line growth in 2021.""

Now enough of this boring shit. Here is my promise for my tattoo:

If AMD breaks 95+ by 1/29/2020, I will get a tattoo of a rocket on my chest.

If AMD breaks 100+ by 02/09/2020, I will get a tattoo of the WSB man on my chest.

The tattoo (if happening) will take place on February 9th/10th with a post update.

AMZN: To Short or Not to Short?,0
"$TSLA - BIGGEST PROFIT OPPORTUNITY ON TSLA THIS ALL 2021I'm going to be quick but clear about what's up, it's a lot of numbers so I TLDR'd.

1. Falling wedge on the annual graph for TSLA, we're compressed and ready to go in either direction. Not good enough. Which direction? 

2. There are 881,441 calls written between now and the 10th of next month and 1,026,076 puts. 60% ish I didn't bother to get perfect %s. 

3. The distribution of the top 10 highest volume contracts from this window of time is 60% bullish compared to where we're at today, i.e. MMs don't wanna get assigned at 645 upward to 700-ish between now and mid-July. The 40% which are bearish are at current levels, lowest is 600. All of this makes sense for a wedge and out of 10, it's basically 50/50, let's just forget the 10% delta... so we need to get clusters from the top 10.

4. Of the 60% which are bullish 33% of them are in the top 3. Top **6** is 80% bullish. 75% of bearish writes are in the bottom 30% of the top 10 highest volume calls.

__**All of this combined tilts $TSLA about 1% toward the bullish direction for a massive breakout between now and the end of July.**__

If you want to believe $TSLA follow any kind of rules, there is also this that makes it maybe 55% bullish on calls.

`In Kirkpatrick and Dalquist's Technical Analysis, they write that the failure rate for the falling wedge is considerably low. The failure rate for an upwards breakout is only 8% ‚Äì 11%. The rarer breakout lower has a much higher failure rate of 15% ‚Äì 24%`

## Micro Symmetrical Triangle with Bullish Bias

* Lose 451.29 and the pattern is null
* Needs clear 452.96 to be viable.
* If we can‚Äôt clear 452.96 then the pattern shifts to double top. If we see a strong rejection, I‚Äôll be looking for 450.66 as a downside target.
* Bullish üéØ 454.26 - 456.38
* I‚Äôll be looking to trim 90% of positions at the 454 range and leave runners for the full measure (if it can get there)

## Uptrend Break to Downside

* Lose 451.87 - 451.50 and look for 450.17
* Lose 450.17 and look at the pivot at 448.37
* Bearish üéØ 447.17 - 444.09
* Finding support at 448.37 will put us in another rectangle. Thanks, Theta.

Notes:

* Neutral 440-449. Bullish 450+. Bearish at 439 and below. Want to see us close above 450 next week for a few days to be bullish.
* If we get near 448-450, I want to see if buyers come in - if they do, I believe we will finally get the full measure by the close. If they don‚Äôt, then I‚Äôll look to 445-444.
* All else fails just trust the levels and measured moves, trimming or taking full profit at half measures and leaving runners for full measured moves.
* The 1-Day Netfow looks bearish so this does give me pause to increase positions at the open, especially if we have a substantial gap up open.
* Daily RSI - bullish. 65 min RSI - bullish - near overbought. 15 min. RSI - bullish near overbought.
* Bearish diversion on the 15 min. for what it‚Äôs worth.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks in the United States rallied the most in nine months, with major averages rising at least 2% on hopes that the omicron variant will not derail global growth.
* Treasuries fell, causing two-year yields to reach their highest level since March 2020.
* The rebound was led by technology stocks, which led the decline last week. The Nasdaq 100 index increased by 3%, an etf that tracks newly public companies increased by 5%, and small caps increased by 2%. The S&amp;P 500 recovered all of the losses suffered following Jerome Powell's hawkish stance a week ago, and was only 0.3% lower than its previous close before the Omicron variant shook markets.
* The CBOE volatility index fell five points to 22. In New York, the dollar fell and crude oil rose above $71 per barrel.
* Risk assets are recovering this week after preliminary data showed that the surge in omicron cases has not overwhelmed hospitals and China moved to expand economic support. A Goldman Sachs group basket of non-profitable technology firms rose nearly 6% on Tuesday, recouping nearly half of last week's losses.
* In terms of data, the US trade deficit shrank, while third-quarter productivity fell. Private consumption was the most important driver of the eurozone's most recent economic expansion.

#### Commentary:

* Nice run today from the Bulls.
* I still maintain that we will see a Christmas rally if Bulls hold 462.
* Depending on futures 469.71 - 468.69 may act as support or resistance (pointed out on gap analysis chart)
* Best case for Bulls tomorrow is they establish and hold support at 469.71 - 468.69 for more upside.
* Base case for Bears is they fill all of the gap (463.68 - 460.59 - 459.15) tomorrow as quickly as possible.
* **Expecting a dip tomorrow - look for gap fill to hold for downside risk**

#### Levels:

* Micro support: 466.09
* Gap fill: 463.68 - 460.59 - 459.15 \*Please note that we could find support at these levels)
* Pivot: 469.19, 456.45
* Resistance - 473.95
* Bullish Targets: 477.43 - 481.50 - 484.54
* Bearish Targets: 456.45 pivot - 450.92 - 447.69 - 443.43

## Gap Analysis - 65 min

* Bulls filled gap from 11/30
* Bulls nearly filled gap from 11/26
* If we gap down on futures tomorrow - 469.71 - 468.69 may act as resistance.
* If we gap up and hold 469.71 - 468.69 we may test 473 tomorrow.

"Bezos, Cow Farts, and You: How $AMZN's deal w/ $CLNE is the most confusing in at least 30 seconds; unwinding it so people will stop being so ignorant about it.Hello, ""Apes"".  it is I...also....ape.  Yes, ape.  Here to bless you with lots of rocket emojis and bananas as I am clearly one of you.  Or something.  We still say on fleek, right? I mean, I totally know, but I'm not sure if you, too, are...you know, fellow ape....

&amp;#x200B;

Hmm, it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard.  This makes fellow ape very angry, and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this, ape honor.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I've seen an enormous amount of confusion from the, you know, ""non-apes"", about what $CLNE's contract with $AMZN is.  So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don't get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information.  So let's talk about it:

&amp;#x200B;

# What's the deal:

&amp;#x200B;

In late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide.  This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN's warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

The first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today's value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don't know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they'll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.

&amp;#x200B;

# Now, the part the less intelligent ""non-apes"" don't seem to grasp, but the most important part:

&amp;#x200B;

Less discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they've got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it's the part most people don't seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they're paying, which means it's in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as ""gently nudging"" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean ""waterboarding until they comply"".  You're already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why does any of this matter?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, ""fellow ape"", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it's this:  If $AMZN's ""win"" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to ""win"", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE's price should not be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN is paying, that's wrong, and everybody who's been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN's cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn't agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.

&amp;#x200B;

So there the ""non apes"" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn't get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO'd into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn't understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can't.  Jeff's not as wise an ape as a WSB ape.

&amp;#x200B;

"If you had a bad week take my debit spread on aapl your guaranteed to profitOkay so I'm not sure how your week went guy but here is a really safe play both the prices strike prices are itm underneath support 

So the play it's a weekly personally I don't really like playing these but this one is looking very promising I used the bid and ask price for both of these so you should get instantly filled probably can squeeze out a little more profit if your willing to wait to get filled.

So the play

Buy a aapl 9/21 call strike price is 215$ you should be expecting to pay around 9.35$ to get instantly filled 

Sell a aapl 9/21 call strike price is 217.50 ( support is 218$) to instantly sell it'll have to be at 7.00

Now you maximum net debit of 235$ this is the most you can lose 

If aapl is above 217.51 you'll make a whole 15$ 
If aapl is below 217.50 youll lose all your debit 235$ 

Now here is the beautiful part is aapl is above 220.50$ you make your maximum return of 265$ 

Because your 215$ will be worth 5.50$ at 200.50 
And the one you sold short (217.50)  will be a -50$ to you 550-50= 500 now take that 500$ and take away your debit of $235 and your return is 265 enjoy :)

This looks like a classic abandoned baby bear pattern. That would indicate there is more downside to go tomorrow. However, zoomed out I do see a potential bull flag forming here also. The last 4 days most of the trading was spend between 395 and 398.5. We really need to see a clean break under or over these levels to have a nice sense of direction. 

We failed outreach the daily 200ema again today but despite the heavy sell volume we managed to hold 395 support very well. I don‚Äôt particularly have an opinion on where we are going tomorrow and for that reason I did sit cash overnight. 

Support- 395.4 -&gt; 393 -&gt; 390

Resistance- 398.5 -&gt; 402

Similar consolidation on Futures here holding in that 4000 to 3965 range for 4 days now. I would like to see one of these key levels broken here in order to have a better sense of direction for the next few days. 

The futures daily chart looks more like a bull flag to me then the SPY daily chart does though. 

Support- 3965 -&gt; 3925 -&gt; 3905 -&gt; 3865

Tesla had broken out of its falling wedge yesterday only to now find itself back inside yet again another falling wedge. With that nice daily 8ema rejection and double top off 196.1 yesterday I did take some overnight puts slightly OTM on Tesla and boy did they print at open! I unfortunately did close a little early but I like to take profits. Tesla especially has a way of moving like wild fire at open where you don‚Äôt know if its about to rip $4 green or $4 red. I have found with Tesla if I am correct its best to secure profits immediately at open and if im wrong its best to wait on the first 30 minutes.

Looking at Tesla daily today we now have yet again another falling wedge formed but more importantly than that we did break through that 5 day long blue support line. This should open up some more downside for Tesla here now. 187.66 is currently the weekly 200ema on tesla which we now are back under neath. I was watching this level very closely last week and as I had mentioned last week a closure under this should open up a lot more downside. 

Key support- 186.6 -&gt; 177.4

Resistance- 191.5 -&gt; 196.1

The VIX did a whole lot of nothing today. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/15yqxem8td0a1.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9da0d03c03843bb9cfee7d56408dacd2c06b34e

I don‚Äôt ever include a 15min chart on the VIX but I just had to show how flat it really was today. Between the bold vertical purple lines is the intraday open to close. The vix held an impressively tight $1.73 cent range all day long. Im not sure if people are still on edge about the Poland/ Russia stuff and are unwilling to take their put hedges off or if we have just reached a point where no one is putting downside protection on but the fear isn‚Äôt ready to continue to unwind out of the market. 

Overall though we are clearly still holding that 23.5 level where I struggle to be bullish shorter term/ longer term until we unwind under neath that.

**Daily Log-** 

Today was a really tough day to trade and I got stopped out and stopped myself out a few times only to go green. I also was the lucky part for a few rogue candle spikes in my favor too. A green day but not my best day that‚Äôs for sure. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gak12zi9td0a1.png?width=863&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1123fb381059f7cddd12fd5178469736008f9ff

This week has been pretty interesting for me. I haven‚Äôt really been doing it on purpose per say but I have found that I have take a major risk off on Scalps this week. I have only scalped a total of 9 times this whole week (about 3/ day). However, in the last month or so I have been averaging 5-10 scalps/ day. I also have seen a major uptick in my level to level plays now fronting about 8-10/ day when over the last month I have at best done 2-4 a day. 

Overall I would say win rate and profits have been consistent with this change. I still believe we are in a scalpers market but I have really been enjoying these level to level plays. While I find that humbly I am good at scalps and good at recognizing high probability set ups. IT has been a really nice change of pace to be able to open a play and let it play out without having to have my finger on sell the whole time and without being worried about one small pop stopping me out only for it to come back to my favor. 

Something to keep in mind in my level to level plays and really in any strategy you deploy in this market is the risk to reward. I am not perfect and it would be practical to have a 100% win rate all the time‚Ä¶ yes at times I have done it for short periods of times but its improbable to expect it. What we need to focus on is high probability and high risk to reward set ups. So this means we have to be willing to go into a position that COULD stop us out at out -20%. But the risk to reward and probability of green is high enough that the reward out weighs the risk. It is also important in this market to use stop losses. 

Most importantly though it is important to be mechanical in those stop losses. The second you remove that stop loss ‚Äúto let it play out‚Äù you already loss. You loss because you broke your rules in an attempt of being smarter than the market. 

Stay mechanical. Take the high probability plays. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take 3-5% if that means green. If you see it going against you‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt have to let it play all the way to the stop loss.

"AMZN earnings DD
This was longer than I expected..but here you go.  Hope the formatting works

Revenue
The bar is low.....expecting only 59.7B revenue vs 51B last year.(72.38B last quarter). 

Prediction: They easily beat on revenue.

AWS
Analysts are expecting 7.7B, last quarter was 7.4B...this will smashed by at least 2B.
MSFT grew cloud by 41% to 9.6B....if AMZN is close to a 40% gain, it puts AWS over 10B (7.4B last quarter)

Prediction: Absolutly kills it in cloud

DOD deal
10B DOD cloud deal up for grabs..AMZN is the only company with DOD DISA L6 security level. MSFT is expecting to get it..but has not received it yet. 
Prediction: Could go either way. The government seems to wants MSFT but without clearance AMZN gets it

EPS
Analyst expect 4.72 eps vs 6.04,5.75,5.07 last 3 quarter. Costs will be up, but also revenue up...this will be close to expected.

Outlook
AMZN finally announce they are out of china but will still sell there..they were taking a loss on this market. AMZN is the cloud leader and the market is sky rocketing, we saw this from MSFT. Even though msft is catching up..there is still plenty of money for both companies. Things look good

What about the stock
As with always..Bad earnings or good earnings...AMZN stock could go either direction.

RSI &gt; 70, overbought but that didn't matter for MSFT

$VIAC is making GAMES already!!!! and Btw they are f\*cking popular on Twitch and in Steam - check the screenshot (Twitch) below: ""Nickelodeon All-star Brawl"" = 96.5k viewers &gt; more popular than Fortnite (86.9k), Warzone (70.3k) and FIFA22 (66.5k).

What's wrong with you Apes??? $VIAC is the future of streaming and games, as they have hot ass franchises like Avatar The Last Airbender, South Park, Star Trek, Ninja Turtles and many more... How can $NFLX compete with their shitty Sex Education and Bridgerton bullshit, who even watches that crap??

Here are $VIAC financials for your lazy butts:

$VIAC is currently trades at $39.51 per share with P/E=7.21 and with Profit=$4B and Revenue=$27B and has Strong Balance Sheet of $7B of cash on hand and Assets/Liabilities=2.5, and btw $VIAC pays 2.5% dividend and is selling off Non-core assets like their Publishing business for $2.12B and HQ building to BlackRock for $800m. Clearly, $NFLX with P/E=65 and Revenue=$27B is too fucking expensive. Also, **which event is more likely to happen?** $VIAC going from **$39.51 to $120 (%200 increase)** which will be P/E=20 and market cap $75B, or $NFLX going from **$634.81 to $1,268(100% increase)** which will be P/E=130 and market cap $560B...

"7-27-22 SPY/ ES and Apple Futures Daily TA and FOMC DD/ TA recapWell if you read my FOMC ta/ DD you hopefully bought at 234/235pm and rode calls into flory. Of course it was pretty wild to think that this was just gonna rip. Unfortunately I think I severely underestimated the bulls today‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt let the market drop on FOMC like I expected. I don‚Äôt know if its cause of the bigger run up we had intraday before FOMC or what the reason was. But I expected at least a 0.5 to 1% drop with 392 being my target. We never even dropped 0.3% below $395 before she rocketed‚Ä¶ candles double bottomed off 395.47 and then it was gone from there. 

My plan was to execute a trade at 235pm and get into it. I missed my entry and watched my premium rocket. I was not going to chase it so I sat this one out. Thankfully a lot of people in the server really profited today off this trade and this entry time. I guess I was still in vacation mode and missed my opportunity. With the capital I planned to risk‚Ä¶ it had to be perfect for me to want to enter it and it just wasn‚Äôt 100% what I expected or wanted so I sat it out. It was not very fun watch it go by and sleeping on the entry though. 

https://preview.redd.it/zf1pqcgfg6e91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc6d5e5520490af6bf3d487f35035c0d227fb646

This FOMC had a few interesting things about it though‚Ä¶ 

First off it was the first FOMC that we didn‚Äôt have a red week leading up to it. As you can see below the average drop this year for FOMC (not including January) was 1.2% and we barely dropped 0.3%. The new average is 0.98% drop‚Ä¶ we dropped about 25% of what was expected. We also only rallied 1.9% from 230pm to EOD high. This was about 67% of the expected rally and about 73% of the new average rally. The other weird thing was the volume the Average volume for the FOMCs this year (including January) is 141mil for the day we barely broke 80 mil today. 

*Processing img o689d80gg6e91...*

So where are we? Okay a couple things we need to keep in mind from this meeting and for tomorrow‚Ä¶ we now have 8 weeks till the next FOMC meeting. JPOW did say we are not CURRENTLY in a recession, however, we haven‚Äôt had the 2nd gdp number for him to say we are‚Ä¶ they for the first time ever said ‚Äúwe are taking this meeting to meeting‚Äù and he said that we are still expecting some aggressive rate hikes in the future. The fed for the first time that I have heard said they are downgrading the economy‚Ä¶ they are working off high job growth and low unemployment (when this changes we should be concerned). JPOW did confirm inflation is too high still (duh). Fed is no longer going to provide clear guidance for the future and future hikes like they have in the past. JPOW said the path to a soft landing is quickly narrowing and getting further and further away. No decision or timeline to end rate hikes or slow them. 

The weirdest thing he said was ‚Äúthe first GDP reading is usually heavily revised‚Ä¶‚Äù I think this is going to come back around. 

https://preview.redd.it/k0ttg6mgg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d320d5c7a0aac4928f92f9d7c16106c86cffab8b

Tomorrow we get an interesting amount of economic data with that very important GDP. Forecast is 0.3% and we are expecting per the Atlanta feds GDP now forecast -1.2% as of yesterday. 

https://preview.redd.it/vlbxoc6hg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea4cf8cf6ac318f74e3e2899aca0f8e9215d178a

SO as you can see on the SPY daily we had a pretty major break through of 3 different daily resistance lines today. We also closed over the JPM morgan collars top. The last time we were at the JPM morgan collar we rejected it. This will be interesting to watch play out. The current trajectory we are on could have us resting the orange channel resistance of 411 by August 5th. If we break through that we are actually looking at a possibility of testing the overall bear market channel resistance of 433 by August 18th. If we were to break that green channel resistance at the top this month‚Ä¶ it would confirm bear market is 100% over. That would make a higher high for the first time since January. 

We FINALLY gap filled 401.44 today after trying for the last 1.5 months to fill it. 

We are at a pretty important time here on SPY‚Ä¶ I fully expect a red open tomorrow due to GDP and due to post FOMCs almost always being red. 

https://preview.redd.it/w8tdvq8ig6e91.png?width=958&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1662d7d80e07ab97a889e40905aaffcf32096d2b

The last two FOMC days we have see -3%+ red days and had red opens. With GDP tomorrow it‚Äôs the perfect storm for a nice red day to not only play puts overnight but to find a call loading opportunity. 

Overall I am going to be looking for a call buying opportunity around 394.5 (-1.7%) support test tomorrow. If we break through that support this breaks the upwards trajectory and we could be looking for a restest of 390.9 (-2.6%) support test. I suspect this 390.9 support to hold but if that fails then we start thinking about the 378 gap. Market is in such perma bull mode right now its hard to believe we break back down to 378 gap fill right now. 

Bulls are going to look to break through and close over 401.5 resistance and will now be targeting close over the daily 100ema of 407 (1.5%) tomorrow. From there we just slowly start picking away and resistance line after resistance line. 

https://preview.redd.it/r7amsdqig6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de67c99e6ace034fd5ef69a9a35a6f36e7f72f93

Futures painting a fairly similar picture‚Ä¶ broke some impressive resistance lines today and held support line nicely this morning/ overnight. Overall I will be watching futures more closely as it has been the guide to where we are going next. 

Futures bulls are going to target holding support of 4003 (-0.5%) and then 3960 (-1.5%) tomorrow. Holding 3960 is crucial for bulls tomorrow. Bulls will be looking to break above the daily 100ema at 4080 (1.5%). From there bulls are targeting that orange channel resistance at 4123 (2.6%)  by August 5th. The biggest fight and resistance will take place at 4180 (3.9%) if bulls make it there. 

Bears goal tomorrow is to break through that 3960 support line. From there we start back testing supports at 3920 (-2.5%). 3920 is a major support that bulls can not give up. From there we starts looking at further supports such as 3828 (-4.8%) and 3785 (-6%).

Am I bullish or am I bearish? Well this ones a tough one. FOMC is the wildcard that moves markets more then it should. I don‚Äôt believe a 2.6% green day was very warranted today personally. So my expectation is that we do see a pretty large retrace tomorrow. Also statistically/ historical data speaking we should see a red day (most likely very large) after a FOMC meeting. With GDPs potential 2nd reading coming out tomorrow I suspect that markets are going to be down pre market and at 830 when that news drops (especially with a spike in jobless claims) we will see a very red day. The risk to reward of puts overnight is very high in my opinion and well worth the position. 

Now if tomorrow opens green and we hold green/ close green tomorrow im going to be going full bull here until the market says otherwise. Pretty much the last two weeks now dips have been buying opportunities. GDP is pretty much bears last chance tomorrow to scare the market into a dump. It will be interesting to see what happens. It also worries me how the two trading days before today were both the lowest volume of the year and today was the lowest volume FOMC day this year (about 60% of normal average fomc volume). 

There is an argument that markets are waiting for GDP tomorrow before they full send it bullishly. Depending on how tomorrow plays out I will be looking at some 30dte calls for an expectation that we reach 430 by the end of August. If I don‚Äôt position long (safer not to) I will at least intraday be bullish and trust run ups more than I have before. 

Overall it‚Äôs a very weird market right now when you factor in volume and realistically all the terrible news and bearish catalysts we have‚Ä¶ despite all that we are either truly having the worlds greatest bear market rally or we are seeing the bottom truly be in. Apple is about $1 (at close) from breaking through MAJOR resistance. If apple breaks through $157.66 tomorrow ($158 for confirmation) then apple has officially broke its overall 2022 bear channel‚Ä¶ and it will be the return of the bull run. As crazy as it is to say‚Ä¶ there is a case to be made that Apple retests its ATH by end of August‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/xcf0feskg6e91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea33905045f8cca4f316e51c9a7166883edb537a

10% challenge- 

Despite having the plan for pretty much a month now of how I was going to tackle FOMC day‚Ä¶ I blew it 100%. I did not like when I saw that the markets did not dump at least 0.5%. I was intently watching at 235pm for what it was going to do and before I could enter the entry was gone. 

The other thing I really didn‚Äôt like about today was the IV. The IV never really crushed till after 3pm. We have in the past seen a pretty good IV crush from 215 to 230pm but today we saw IV stay in the 80s the whole time. It made premiums very high and with the smaller then usually move the usually 300-500% gains were not there at all. If you timed the entry perfectly most were seeing 150-200% gains. 

I did a swing SPX over night to hold but took 10% and repositioned into a 4010p for tomorrow. I suspect this will pay out nicely tomorrow. If im wrong the risk to reward was good enough to warrant this play for me. Overall with no IV pump I need a 4005 open -0.4% open for breakeven.

"$NFLX, $AMD, $FB, $AMZN Upcoming Earnings Galore &amp; MoreWhat are you boys playing with the earnings in the next couple of weeks?

I made a fuck-up of deciding to be pessimistic on $AMD at the beginning of June before the bigger run-up. *$14 puts 08/17* At this point, I figure I'll wait for a nasty day and salvage what I have.

Double autistic was my $MU 1/19 position that I opened right before the great Chinese meme massacre. 

With all of the tech and other meme earnings coming up, I'm thinking of eating the $AMD put loss and throwing it into a couple of options for $NFLX or maybe a big boi $AMZN faggie.

"NVDA DD, LongHere's some good DD, been missing some nice DD


$NVDA is a gaming company. It has been since its inception. Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


[Here is the google drive with the model paper, and position proof, updated whenever I update them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h2cTeiNRP07K8-2Wn4lYyQtbB_go2HGB?usp=sharing)


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.

* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.


* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.


* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.


Price Target:


* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. 


What I think:


I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&amp;D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.


I have +1 Jan 19 NVDA $350 Call that I purchased for $8.30. Proof in drive. Why not investing more? I don't want a lot of exposure and I'm poor.


TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity. ",1
"Gather around. Its time to say a prayer for AAPL.Our AAPL, who art in Cupertino California,

Has every sorority girl, Becky and Soccer mom stopped wearing these because the pandemic is over? Are their stores reopening as the virus is contained? March 24th ER and should have a good run up with a pop after a big beat.

Khan played a crucial role as legal counsel for the House antitrust subcommittee‚Äôs 16-month investigation into the Big Tech giants, and in producing the 400-page House Democrat report that alleged that all of the tech giants engage in anti-competitive practices and need to be reined in.

Khan burst onto the scene in antitrust circles in 2017 when she penned a legal paper dubbed ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Antitrust Paradox,‚Äù which spread widely among proponents and critics alike.

"There's probably a play to be made with TSLA's new self-driving computer, which will most likely be based on AMD IPIf they give the specs on April 22, could be a boost for AMD stock... usually these types of announcements give a short-term 5-10% boost to AMD stock. Although it has risen quite a bit recently so not sure what the effect will be on SP. Also keep in mind it's most likely gonna be based on AMD IP, not 100% but pretty good chances. I'd say 90% chance.

Another thing to keep in mind is tesla being tesla it could hype up AMD quite a bit even if the revenue from that IP is quite small. Self-driving being super hyped right now + tesla being the most hyped in the category. But who knows. If you're looking for a YOLO look into it. And I don't think this is fully priced in yet.",0

"3/8/22 SPY Pre-market3/8/22 Pre-Market SPY Analysis

Well after yesterdays absolutely wild -2.95% day we have officially reached a new day. I wanted to start this analysis off with some humble reminders for you guys. First, Just because we saw a massive -2.95% dip yesterday does not mean we will see the same thing today. Second, Just because it was red yesterday doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll be green today. Third, Just because it was red yesterday doesn‚Äôt mean it will be red today. Lastly, We have to as day traders trade the chart that is presented to us. Each day is a slice of a the whole pie but each day is also its individual pie. We can not go into today with a made up mindset or we will get burnt. We HAVE to wait for our perfect setup and trade that. We have to secure profits and we have to be smart traders. We can not afford to be greedy in this market we are in currently.

Lets take a look at futures last night.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5ph22uig16m81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9bce3c071896c436681aa96857a37dde4c6d589f

Overall futures had a pretty flat night trading within a range of 4139 to 4233. This morning we did see a very large double top at 4233 (423 SPY) around 7am (the random 8am candle also had a 3rd spike there too). This to me is going to be the major resistance to beat today.

Looking at futures we do have yet another downward channel I will be watching for us to either trade within today or break.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9j20xvmh16m81.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3832ab64340c905ef1610c30ad5104c7553fe71

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gw76ebqi16m81.png?width=830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=350c52e721dd8a03919b6a7146ec78d9969d2b40

SPY chart itself has a similar channel as FUTURES /ES has formed. We will need to keep a close eye on that. Pre-market is currently sitting at +0.05% green which is about as flat as we can be. Currently VIX is sitting near 35.56 so we will have to keep an eye on that as that can easily cause another big sell off like yesterday.

Support-

\-0.5%= 417.3

\-1%= 415.24

\-1.5%= 413.14 (Futures overnight low)

\-2%= 411.04

\-2.5%= 408.95

419.35 ÔÉ† 418.2 ÔÉ† 417.2 ÔÉ† 415.4 ÔÉ† 413.98 ÔÉ† 411.5 (lower limit of current channel)

Resistance-

0.5%= 421.5

1%= 423.6

1.5%= 425.7

2%= 427.8

2.5%= 429.9

420.5 ÔÉ† 421.6 (upper limit of current channel) ÔÉ† 422.2 ÔÉ† 423 (pre market high/ double top) ÔÉ† 424.2 ÔÉ† 424.9 ÔÉ† 426 ÔÉ† 426.9 ÔÉ† 427.8

Overall while I am going into today with a clear head per the chart that is presented to us favor to bears today again.

Premarket high of 423 is going to be the major resistance to break. If that is rejected we can expect some more downside today and will look for the key after market/ pre market support level of 418.2 to break with an inevitable flush near futures low of 413.

If bulls can break the resistance of 423 we can look for a run up around resistance of 427.

"TSLA Upcoming 4 for 1 Stock Split - An Elon Musk Twitter AnalysisLast year Elon Musk tweeted that ""Tesla stock price is too high imo"". Most people did not think too much of this as they thought he was referring to the then recent price action. However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.

https://preview.redd.it/gd2ixiclhz571.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755c06a09499b39b429a492e67190e41478d5372

He tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1. The 5 for 1 stock split was announced on 8/11.

[Tesla Announces a Five-for-One Stock Split | Tesla Investor Relations](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split)

So why do I think he is hinting at another split? There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).

https://preview.redd.it/blo3ms45iz571.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dbbf2cc89dcd10a9a04460c47c221f67ab92f99

Besides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.

While this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to ""Elon Musk, the 2nd"" which could be referring to the second stock split.

Furthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/bw87j61djz571.png?width=597&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbd74f28b426161b14ac8854c257a12e030564f4

He could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.

Assuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play. Last stock split announcement saw a 13%+ rise the day after as well as an 80%+ rise between the announcement and the actual split which was roughly two weeks later.

"AMD will Rocket after the Xilinx acquisition is approved, which could be as soon as July 6thAMD is the best run simi company in the world right now.

[Su Bae](https://i.redd.it/dvg5sf39rg471.gif)

AMD stock is being held down by Arbitrage trading due to the all-stock fixed-ratio Xilinx acquisition. Once that acquisition is approved by world regulators, arbitrage will stop and the stock will soar. Note that the acquisition doesn't have to close, it just needs to be approved for the Arbitrage to stop. Once Arbitrage stops, all of the short selling which is holding AMD stock down will stop, and AMD will rocket towards it's price targets between $106-135

**Arbitrage effect on stocks**  
 In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the price difference. The short selling pushes the price of AMD down, continually, until the arbitrage stops. 

Read more on AMD Merger Arbitrage here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd\_an\_explanation\_on\_merger\_arbitrage\_and\_how\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/)

Arbitrage will end when the share ratio between XLNX stock and AMD stock is equal, where there's no difference to be gained. Right now the share ratio difference is \~1.57 or about 10%. The 10% difference is there for the chance that the acquisition does not go through. Once world regulators approve it though, the chance of acquisition is basically 100% and the share ratio difference will be 0. With no difference, the arbitrage trading and short selling stops and the stock rises. In the case of AMD, the average price target is some 30% over today's prices, so it should rocket.

**Possibility of Arbitrage ending soon**  
CEO Dr. Lisa Su has said many times that the acquisition will close by the end of the year. She's also always conservative in her estimates. Remember that she said revenue would increase by 37% in 2021, only to revise it in Q2 to 50% growth. Su, you sly.

&amp;#x200B;

You can track the regulatory approval status over here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\_approval\_status/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status/)

The US has already approved and Phase 1 of the approval process for the UK and EU will end on July 6th. If there are no objections, the acquisition is approved from them as well. There are not expected to be any objections. If there were any, they would go into Phase 2, which would end at the end of the year (Lisa's conservative timeline).

The big question is when will China approve? They're the last ones to give the approval. Well no one really knows when this is going to happen. In Oct. of 2020 AMD said they would be drafting a notification to SAMR (China). But that's really the last we heard of it. 

There's a possibility that China will approve around the same time as the UK and EU, which could be as soon as July 6th. In that case,

AMD announced on May 19th that it was initiating a $4B stock buyback. And since then it appears that AMD has been buying back it's own stock in big chunks every day around 9:30-10am:

[perdy](https://preview.redd.it/1cmdiz4fng471.png?width=538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b1e1174f74f52798ea863caab6172b972d0698b6)

The doctor is smart. She knows the arb is keeping the stock down and aims to profit from it. The timing of the buyback may suggest that she thinks the approval is going to happen sooner than the end of the year. 

Either way, the stock will rocket once the approval happens. Could be in less than a month, if not, then it'll be end of year. Either way we're making tendies, it's just a matter of how soon. Place your bets! (not financial advice)

"Most Metaverse users don't even make it a month, WSJ reports 

* Internal documents show Meta's Horizon Worlds platform is struggling to retain users.
* Those who can afford the $400 pricetag report the metaverse has glitchy features and empty worlds.
* Most Metaverse users don't return to the Horizon Worlds platform after the first month.

Inside the Horizon Worlds platform, Meta is struggling to keep users engaged with glitchy features and empty worlds.

With a $400 pricetag to access the platform via the Quest 2 headset, the metaverse isn't yet accessible to the casual user. Those who do get a chance to try the tech experience baffling branded content, persistent bugs, and empty worlds with no user interactions. Even employees appear not to enjoy the platform, saying there is a ""quality"" problem.

Last month, in response to user complaints, Meta put the Horizon platform into ""lockdown"" ‚Äî pausing the rollout of new features while it works to improve the user experience of existing elements in the virtual reality world, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Users have criticized the avatars' curious lack of legs as well as having few other users to interact with. Internal statistics, WSJ reported, indicate that only 9% of worlds built by users are ever visited by at least 50 people, while most never receive any visits at all.

Some female users also report sexual harassment and digital groping, prompting Meta to institute a safety feature that creates a virtual 4-foot buffer around avatars on the platform. WSJ reported men outnumber women by two to one on the platform and that ‚Äî while reporting ‚Äî a WSJ staff member was asked to expose herself by a user she interacted with online.

Internal documents show Meta has fallen far short of its goals for regular monthly users, WSJ Journal reported. The company initially had set a goal of 500,00 monthly users by the end of 2022, but has changed that figure to 280,000. The documents show the platform has less than 200,000 current users. Most users generally don't return to the app after the first month, while more than half of Quest 2 headsets are out of use within six months WSJ reported.

"$TSLA prediction using Wyckoff Result vs Effort Model (AAPL reference)First off, I'm not a financial advisor, I am an absolute idiot. 

So, this isn't going to be the best DD in the world, but I think it offers a pretty significant correlation between the $AAPL Daily chart that is referenced in the Result vs Effort Model that Richard Wyckoff taught.

What we are expecting here, is one last spike in volume on the decline, before a significant increase in value. I'm predicting it to get into the low 900's, maybe 800's again one last time before value incentive really kicks in to take this baby beyond the stratosphere. 

Not to mention, Elon is splitting the stock because it is currently over bought.

The reason for Elon's stock split is to level out the growth of his company, creating more supply so the demand can continue to rise at a healthy rate. I believe this markdown (one more dip with a volume spike) will occur before the stock split in order to prepare $TSLA to be transferred into its new, healthier and more fruitful soil.

Tomorrow is CPI day and they are expecting 8.8. What is very very interesting about this CPI is that this is the HIGHEST level of CPI that the fed has predicted yet. Remember just two months ago they tried to tell us that CPI was peaked yet here we are with a prediction of 8.8%. 

My thoughts are that with the Feds projecting CPI to be 0.5% higher than their last projection which usually misses by about 0.2% at times I suspect we are going to get a reading of 9% CPI. 

When we get this 9% CPI we are going to see the VIX massively spike which will cause us to dump hard af. We then will for the next 2 weeks while we wait for FOMC, earnings and GDP continue to dump (I made a post last night about going long on VIX/ UVXY calls I definitely recommend you read it as it adds to all of this too). 

https://preview.redd.it/j9jfishi47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1ce646bbdfe5b81247539cc0abdb93511072043

I will be SHOCKED if CPI is anything but 9% but I took profits on almost everything but my UVXY calls cause I don‚Äôt trust this market or the fed lol.

Overall the daily looks clear as to where we are going‚Ä¶ I mentioned last week we looked to be in a 370 to 390 channel and that is exactly what this week has played out as. I would be shocked if we don‚Äôt see 370 tomorrow (-2.7% day). If we break through 370 and close under it this week I think we are going to be setting up for 340-350 by EOM. 

https://preview.redd.it/aaih33lj47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e429b5ba985120726ee44900f825a15aa780105

Monday I called out the 3810 level for ES futures that I expected us to see. Here we are hitting it intraday today. PT for futures is 3675 by EOW (-4% from 3820). Overall we finally see a close below the daily 8ema on ES futures which we were waiting for to have confirmation of down trend. 

https://preview.redd.it/bvzov25k47b91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb6fc1e00bc53da78f0f83ac0b9dff88277ab6ea

The one weird outlier today was the VIX. Even with that massive 1.3% sell off EOD today from 1pm to 345pm we never saw the vix break 28. Which tells me that the VIX (fear) did not lead this sell off but rather sheer volume. We had some pretty low sell pressure for how strong of a sell off we had though. We only saw -1.5 at the peak when most big dumps see -5 to -10. 

I am highly expecting the VIX to finally spike tomorrow when the market get rocked by a 9% CPI. A 25% vix day is likely and would put VIX near 35. 

10% challenge-

And if im wrong then im wrong but with these UVXY calls in the off chance that CPI isn‚Äôt too bad I should be able to get out still with a small loss. It was the smartest play.

Most people did not think too much of this as they thought he was referring to the then recent price action. However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.

https://preview.redd.it/gd2ixiclhz571.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=755c06a09499b39b429a492e67190e41478d5372

He tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1. The 5 for 1 stock split was announced on 8/11.

[Tesla Announces a Five-for-One Stock Split | Tesla Investor Relations](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split)

So why do I think he is hinting at another split? There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).

https://preview.redd.it/blo3ms45iz571.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3dbbf2cc89dcd10a9a04460c47c221f67ab92f99

Besides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.

While this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to ""Elon Musk, the 2nd"" which could be referring to the second stock split.

Furthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.

He could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.

Assuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play. Last stock split announcement saw a 13%+ rise the day after as well as an 80%+ rise between the announcement and the actual split which was roughly two weeks later.

"Intel vs AMDSo as INTC has been beaten down over the years as AMD Ryzen chips have basically taken over gaming recently, I was wondering what the future for INTC is. It's recently gotten a lot better at making chips and apparently maybe a mining chip coming soon?

Well... AMD has had a crazy high run up and I believe in both companies greatly but I'm wondering which has more room to grow? 

I would think INTC as it's been beaten down but it still has a larger market cap by $60 billion. So which has more room to grow and more expansive in the coming years.

Especially with earnings coming up, what do you think will grow bigger and end up beating the other? Or which will create better technology? Should I wait for more of a dip for AMD? Just what are your opinions in general about these two?",0

"10-21-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Weekly Market AnalysisWell to say I was wrong about what would happen today is an understatement. I was 100% not expecting a green day and let me tell you if someone woulda told me that we would go from a -1% pre market to closing at 2.43% green today I woulda laughed in their faces. From the lowest point to the highest point SPY moved $12.3 up. 

So where does that leave us? 

Well lets take a look at a few MACRO things first here. Next week is the week before FOMC (November 2nd). Now generally if we look at the previous FOMCS 5 out of the 6 last pre-FOMC weeks finished green averaging about a -4.41% drop. However, if we look at July you can see it was the only week where SPY finished green all year. What was the difference? Well that was back when they started the fed pivot/ inflation is getting better narrative. So I ask myself‚Ä¶ are we in a inflation sucks, feds never going to stop hiking environment OR are we in an inflation is peaking and feds going to slow the big hikes soon? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kk87uy7kx8v91.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a94673e0a2e47b5b9c4b87eaff0ee8dd55d1a0fc

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zsbgobnkx8v91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=277d33fd37be5015be893e3316b2496ed9eeca01

Now I don‚Äôt like to include so many tweets in my TA but I find these to be VERY important. So lets break this down here‚Ä¶ Next week is the week before FOMC. November 2nd will be FOMC. Followed by the next CPI reading the following week on November 10th. 

So what does that mean. Today Bullard and Daly pretty much said without saying it and the WSJ article said that the fed is most likely going to do a 75bps hike on November 2nd. Once that hike is done in order to not over due it with rate hikes and cause a market crash/ collapse the economy they are most likely going to ‚Äúpullback‚Äù to a 25 or 50bps hike. While this is NOT a pause what this is‚Ä¶ is a clear slowing of rate hikes from the mouths of the fed themselves. This is one of the first times we have actually heard them discuss slowing or a lesser rate hike. 

Why is this all important and how does it effect next week? Well the fed is now in a quiet period. What does that mean? That means no fed member can speak publicly to the press or say anything else until FOMC happens. They just left us with some extreme bullish news (even more bullish then when we rallied back in July-August). 

My thoughts are this‚Ä¶ next week we rally on this news and expectations of a 75bps hike followed by a 25-50bps hike in December. The week of FOMC we rally when JPOW confirms this news. Then this is when it gets tricky (and I don‚Äôt have the CPI consensus numbers yet to give an accurate probability of what CPI will be) but there is a chance that CPI will miss again and even if it does miss there is a chance that we will see markets rally instead of dropping just like the Septembers. Why? Because markets know that even if the CPI is bad the FED is going to slow its rate hikes. So unless JPOW says something different on November 2nd I would be bullish for the new two weeks minimum. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the SPY daily chart we actually have a really nice W pattern forming. What I am seeing is that today should have been our chance to retest the lower lows of the 350s however we rallied instead. With this daily candle being a two day (almost 3 day) bullishly engulfing candle with a double bottom off 365.1 from here I would expect upside. We have been trading in this grey channel for a full month now. The key resistance for this channel lies at 378.2 and the overall bear channel (blue dotted line) resistance from the August top lies at 378.8 from Monday. If we break through and close over those levels then in the next week or two we should look for a retest of the 390 level. However, if we reject that 378.2 level then I would be looking for us to maintain this grey channel and puts would be the most probable play. 

Daily supports- 370.5 -&gt; 365.2 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.5

Daily resistance- 374.3 -&gt; 378.2 -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.3

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r3pnjfrlx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64f25e7a576acef7ddb04be2a5633f5e7a3d157a

On the SPY weekly we have a very V double bottom forming and we closed back over the weekly 200ema for the first time in a month. However we did fall just short of breaking through and closing over the daily 8ema. While we are still in this black bear channel right now that dates back to August. If SPY breaks through 374.3 at any point Monday or next week we will be through the bear channel resistance and that will open up the upside with a target of 382 to 385. 

Weekly support- 363.7 -&gt; 357 -&gt; 348

Weekly resistance- 374.6 -&gt; 385.4

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see I am long on calls for SPY next week.

Looking at the futures daily chart I feel like the overall V bottom is even more clear. This was a fairly bullish close as the futures daily candle not only backtested and held support at 3675 to form a double bottom it also fully bull engulfed the previous 3 trading days and closed over key resistance of 3760. 

Futures will look to target 3880 next week as the next major daily resistance level. 

Daily support- 3708 -&gt; 3675 -&gt; 3586

Daily resistance- 3775 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3875

&amp;#x200B;

Futures weekly also has a nice V bottom but more notable had a major support area now at 3590 that has been held for 4 weeks in a row now. Futures weekly too closed over the weekly 200ema ofr the first time in a month but did fall short of breaking through its bear channel resistance and daily 8ema. However, unless we see futures Monday open down below 3690 (-2%+ red open) and hold that level all week we will see the futures weekly pattern broken through. This will open up the upside to retest the next resistance level at 3900 which notably is just over the JPM collar of 3870. 

Weekly support- 3705 -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3500

Weekly resistance- 3775 -&gt; 3890

&amp;#x200B;

On Apples daily I had called out earlier in the week that Apple was through its August bear channel resistance. However, as soon as it poked through it sold off. I was bearish based on that sell off, however, Apple has found some heavy support on its daily 8ema and at this point has broken through 145.4 resistance and wicked over the next major resistance of 147.5. With a close over the daily 20ema for the first time since September (SPY also closed over its daily 20ema) this is a pretty bullish sign moving forward. 

I will be watching that key red v bottom support very closely next week. The next major resistance level to break on the daily is 149.3.

Daily support- 145.5 -&gt; 142.9 -&gt; 141 -&gt; 138.2

Daily resistance- 147.6 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 150.7

The Apple weekly bear channel has also not been broken yet. However, with 3 week strong support put in at that key 138.2 support level and a nice v bottom support bounce‚Ä¶ Apple was able to close over its weekly 8ema for the first time since the week of August 22nd. I will be looking for apple to test that bear channel resistance and break through it next week. Much like SPY unless Apple opens and holds red below 147.3 all week it will take out that bear channel resistance and open the upside. 

Apple posts earnings on October 27th also to keep in mind. 

Weekly support- 141.2 -&gt; 138.2 -&gt; 133.4

Weekly resistance- 147.3 -&gt; 150.5 -&gt; 155.9

Much like SPY I am bullish for Apple and i am expecting an upside move for Apple.

Now Tesla is the wild child of the bunch. I actually had even mentioned in my TA yesterday that I almost was convinced of buying longer DTE calls on tesla because of how hard it bounced and how well it held that 205 support area. Well today reconfirmed my bullish suspicions. I am looking for Tesla to break through that bear channel Monday and see a bigger push up. After putting its 52week low in this week and being absolutely beaten down for the last month straight‚Ä¶ Tesla is poised for a big bounce if the markets bounce. 

Daily support- 206.3 -&gt; 196

Daily resistance- 215 -&gt; 223 -&gt; 233.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2ib64rdpx8v91.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd4b0e0c7e534d1569063b6d899f4cee89d1b673

Tesla weekly finally for the first time in 5 weeks broke its resistance line. With a nice bounce off 205 I am looking for a bigger push up. While this is not a true double bottom I am looking for that 205 support level to hold. There is always a chance we could retest it early next week but I believe Tesla will seek upside from here as long as the rest of the market is doing the same. 

Tesla has a pretty big no mans land from 223 to 255 area. After the May/ June low it spent a lot of time consolidating there before it finally pushed for the 300s. I would expect tesla to attempt to close somewhere inside that range next week. 

Weekly support- 205 -&gt; 191.9 -&gt; 167.8 

Weekly resistance- 223 -&gt; 254.7 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0aiog7ypx8v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6393e383943329d759e51de47f46f93001338a9c

As you can see with SPY, Apple and Tesla I am attempting to add some Level to Level plays (as I call them) into my trading. I have been absolutely killing it with scalps lately but I see an opportunity as of late to enter some longer DTE plays and play these key level breakouts and break downs. I look forward to incorporating them as time goes on, but also recognizing that not every day or week will have level to level play. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/utnevgarx8v91.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11a23b9e30200aa2d37b14423cc4ab7d006ba8f3

And then there was the VIX. Now you would think with SPY moving $12+ from pre market to HOD and having a nearly 2.5% green day that we would see the VIX massively unwind right? Well you would be wrong. The craziest thing is that as SPY rose the 2nd half of the day the VIX actually rose with it. Now I have said this numerous times but I really just don‚Äôt believe the VIX anymore. However, the key takeaway is we close below the daily 8ema and below the daily 20ema for the first time since middle of September. However, we did not lose the bull channel support just yet. This is the last piece to the bullish puzzle. 

10% challenge-

Overall a pretty good day for me today and a pretty great week overall. Not my best win rate by far but overall $$ and % gains was great this week. 

As I was saying below is an example of some of the LEVEL to LEVEL plays I am going to start incorporating into my own trading that I hope allows me outside of my scalps to capture more gains and more moves.

"How to play extremely high-risk FDs with 1000% upside. With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I've been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.

Since you all love throwing your money away, I'll share how I play FDs. I cannot understate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won't go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you're serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.

I only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I'll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It's possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I'll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don't go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. 

In my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn't a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you're only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don't mess with FDs if I'm only looking at a realistic upside of 500%.

**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**
-

I haven't bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I've bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. 

So, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn't like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ's results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn't have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.

Thus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.

-

**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you'll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. 

1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. 

2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We're banking on some unexpected volatility. 

3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it's all over. 

4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. 

5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ's average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I'm predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that's more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it's a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ's yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday's close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.

6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren't really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.

-

And now onto the actual play.

* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**

These are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday's closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. 

If this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say ""Wednesday noon"", I don't actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. 

These estimates are going to be off because we're dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you're trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I'm not wrong often.

By the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you're down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.

-

**Apple ($AAPL)**
-

I personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I'll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. 

* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**

These calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. 

Reasoning in decreasing significance: 

1. Apple's earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. 

2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn't only because they're both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. 

3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. 

4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn't a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don't go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. 

5. With the tax cuts and Apple's big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they're good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.

-

As always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there's a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn't go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road. ",0

"Long $AMD - My Next Potential 10X AMD TradeHi fellow apes,  
Long time no see.

Some of you may remember me from my two insane $AMD trades last year, both of which went up 1000%.  
I have one of those for you today.  


This is a multi-pronged thesis for why I went long on $AMD at these levels, which I will summarize in the following points :  


\-- Macro Picture --  
The market has just experience a major correction that last several months that was fueled by the fed tightening monetary policy. I believe the correction is over and the market has now gotten more used to a more hawkish fed.

The fed has gotten more Hawkish due to inflation, which I believe will begin stabilizing and even subsiding over the next several quarters.   
Primarily because  :  
1- Consumer demand and spending has been declining for two months and will continue to do so IMO, due to a moderation of govt spending bills, stimulus money running out and savings declining.

2- Because inflation of energy prices due to the Russian-Ukaranian war have mostly already been baked in since March.

Slowing inflation can give leeway to the fed to turn less hawkish, which can fuel a major bull market rally.  
\-- AMD's Fundamental Picture --  
AMD's price has gone down by nearly half since its major peak last year at around \~$160  
Nothing fundamental about AMD's business has changed . The company even raised its growth expectations for 2022 in its last earnings call. AMD is expected to grow its revenue by no less than 60% by the end of the year and more than double its profit.  
Demand for semiconductors continues to be very strong and will remain so for the remainder of the year.  
AMD successfully completed its acquisition of XLNX late last year, which strengthens AMD's competitive position in the server business, and area where the company has been kicking ass and taking record breaking market share from Intel.  In fact more than a quarter of all x86 CPUs sold today are AMD, the [highest market share](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-amd-4q-2021-2022-market-share-desktop-notebook-server-x86) in the history of the company.

The company is also expected to release the first ever 5nm x86 ""Zen 4"" CPUs [this year](https://www.techspot.com/news/92835-amd-ces-2022-roadmap-zen-4-am5-ryzen.html), which would extend its manufacturing process lead vs Intel and allow it capture even more market share and grow profitability and margins.

\-- AMD's Technical Picture --

1- I believe AMD has bottomed here at the \~$90 level.  
Why?  
\- We tagged the 100-day moving average for the first time since April 2018. The last time this happened AMD went up from $10 to $30 in six months.  
\- We hit a double bottom on the daily RSI after a major peak. The last time this happened was Dec 2018 and AMD went up by 60% the following 6 weeks.  
\- AMD has been on a very strong bullish trendline since 2016. The stock just entered the most attractive green buy zone on my hand drawn pitchfork channel. This has only happened 3 times in the last 5 years. Every time it happened in those 3 instances AMD went up by 38%, 240% &amp; 66% respectively.

Ive gotta give it to the bulls today. I was watching intraday driving and up until about 1015 it looked like we were headed for another disastrous bear day. But the bulls were able to get it done today and managed to break into the next level up of 396 to 406 and close within that channel. 

However, we have a couple key things to bare in mind as we head into tomorrow (and these are before SNAP destroyed the markets after hours). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/30u5rnrv9b191.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06bfce12aff19c1ec22b21262e32645e4d59450c

The daily chart which is arguably my favorite chart of them all to reflect on everyday has painted quite a grim picture for us. 

Couple big things to note here Today was the lowest volume day since April 20th which led to a nice 1.5% red day and another 2.74% red day following that. While we did finish above the daily 8ema of 396.64 the failed to close the candle body over it and we also failed to break into the next resistance level of 398. Being that we failed to break that key 398 resistance that was easily obtainable it would be natural for us to retest support at 392.6 which we are currently trending dangerously close to after hours. 

On the daily I drew four blue arrows. If you note these four blue arrows they all have about the same trend. 3 days to make a new LOWER high point near the daily 8ema that then leads to a massive sell off. The current daily candle much like the other three candles I highlighted all are hammer candles (with the exception of the April 21st candle).  I would have liked to see the daily candle test close to that red resistance line of the bear channel but this could be the next high high before we see a sell off. 

&amp;#x200B;

You guys all know I absolutely love my VIX chart and heres why! I highlighted it in orange this time to show you just how strong this ‚Äúchannel‚Äù is that the VIX likes to trade within. Overall the VIX since end of April till now has traded between 28 and 34 for the majority of the time. Lately everytime the VIX bounces off this 28-28.5 range we see a pretty significant recoil back over 30 the following day. 

The most notable times the VIX has gone under 28 and then seen a recoil the following day were April 26th (-2.9%), April 28th (-3.7%), May 5th (-3.55%), May 18th (-4%) and last Friday May 20th (while finishing +0.04 we all remember it had a massive drop from its height of 397 to 380.5). Now we have ole snapchat who decided to take a big oopsies with their earnings currently sitting at -30% (LOLLL), which also took FB (meta) down 7.32% currently and pretty much the rest of the market into the red I would say its all but in the bag that we should see a fairly red day tomorrow. One thing to note is that after hours that 393 support did hold fair strong. If we were to break under 393 it would be fairly easy to assume that we will see 388 tomorrow if not lower. 393 to 388 was a range we traded within a lot last week.

Another reason im a big believe in puts overnight is that on the weekly SPY perfectly rejected tis resistance line that‚Äôs now 8 weeks old.  I am looking for a test of 378 support this week next.

I opened this put around 315 when it looked like we might actually close under 395. I felt very strongly about holding this over night ever before snap and everything else. With a current breakeven at 393 with this current IV I suspect that we will see the VIX spike back near 30 tomorrow and us open at or under 393 tomorrow morning. It will be very interesting to see how futures react over night. With the VIX trend, spy daily hammer candle, FOMC minute anticipation tomorrow and now snapchat earnings tomorrow I think a very bearish day just might be in store for us!

I did a similar post for the probability of how SPY will react when FOMC happened a few weeks ago and figured I would do the same for SPY with FOMC minutes. As you know almost anything fed wise will move the markets fairly aggressively.

The following day however was followed by a ginormous sell off.

Looking at the APRIL fomc it‚Äôs a little different‚Ä¶ so as you can see we sold off into FOMC which tells me the market was expecting bad new however, once FOMC minutes released intraday we saw a dump then massive recovery. The following day of FOMC did see a large sell off intraday, however, this was the time for SPY where we were seeing massive intraday reversals left and right. 

Overall both FOMC minute days does look like puts at open is the play and that a straddle right before FOMC minutes might be a great play too.",1

"AMZN DD from inside Bezos testing facilityJeff Bezos is a real-life James Bond villain, and Amazon will soon rule everything.

Go Long.

I'm at that age where I remember hearing about Amazon on on TV when my parents watched the news, but never really knowing what it was. There really was a time where people didn't know what ""online"" meant. Not everyone had a computer back then, maybe you knew someone who's family had one. When I was a kid I played one computer game and I had to have one. It was like 6 years later that it was cheap enough for my family to get one. Then it wasn't until I had my own money did I wind up on Amazon-- looking for something to buy that I couldn't get at Fred Myers or at the shops downtown. I don't really remember what I bought but I remember thinking how cool it was that something I wanted just came to my house. It's like being God, except you pay money to do it.

So sometimes I would buy stuff on Amazon. Usually around the Holidays or when I needed PC parts (Newegg mostly though). There was a lot of cool stuff you could buy on Amazon, like anything you needed. It just didn't make sense, because it took like a week to get something you could drive to the store for. That's before shipping costs. So, I bought a few things on Amazon from time to time.

I always got my stuff when they said it would arrive. I had never had a bad experience with Amazon really. Then one year I bought my mom a Kindle fire. She loved reading books, so it was perfect. She loved it. She bought so many books. Every day I saw her she had that Kindle. It lasted a little over a year. Out of warranty. So, I did what anyone would do and emailed Jeff Bezos and asked something along the lines of:

'what the heck mother trucker, your stupid great product failed the questionably short warranty expired. That's fucked up.' 

To my surprise I got an email back, from someone at Amazon stating that Jeff had asked them to respond to my email. The gist of what I recall was that the person told me 'sucks to suck, you can buy the new Kindle Fire HD though'. I was upset, but I couldn't not buy my mom a new Kindle. So, I did. I still shopped at Amazon after a cooling off period, like a week, then I bought some shorts or something idk. That Kindle Fire HD lasted up until last year though. 

Now, I buy everything on Amazon. I live in Seattle, so it's their testing ground. I get all my groceries of Amazon, with their Fresh Service. I can almost anything you need delivered within an hour if you want with Prime Now, or in two hours for free. I can get clothes to try on for a week and send back what I don't like (also sunglasses). Bulk deals are getting better with Pantry. The Treasure Truck shit is crazy.

The only thing I don't buy on Amazon is cigarettes and like snacks or a drink at work or walking around. They recently launched that Amazon GO store in January, you know the one where you just walk in and walk out. They're already putting up another and it says opening in the Fall. So, I'll probably get my snacks/drinks from there since it's close. I think Jeff has something against Tobacco cause it's the one thing they don't sell, you can buy Alcohol from the GO stores. 

Everyone I know is the same up here, some still go to grocery stores but they're also the ones who have a family, cars, and go to Costco. But they use Amazon for everything else. They have local market stuff, plus Whole Foods now. The everyday brand stuff is a good deal in my book-- and it keeps getting better. Plus, I can put in an order at like 8 pm to have something that gets to my place at fucking 6:30 in the morning.

It's some dark arts kind wizardry the fact that it's always here, always early, and always right. Also, the alcohol selection has pretty much anything you need. Not everyone has this yet, but everyone already has Prime-- well 100 million, but just wait til you can get anything and everything whenever you needed it from Amazon. Also imagine when recreational use of Marijuana is legal on the federal level and I guarantee you Amazon will put every dispensary out of business if Jeff decides to. 

I thought I've been seeing more of the Prime Air planes more frequently, then when I visited my dad and he mentioned seeing one. Looked it up: Amazon has their own fleet of 32 planes, started about two years ago with their first plane and now targeting 40 by the end of the year.

"Long MSFT Calls - Price IncreasesI work in the industry and all the buzz the past week has been about MSFT increasing prices starting October 1st. The meat and potatoes of this is that they are screwing over large customers who have what they call ""enteprise agreements"" that give them better discounts and more flexible license options, price locks, deploy now pay later, things like that. They are increasing pricing on specific products anywhere from 10%-30%. This is basically their continued effort to squeeze people in to their pay monthly/yearly per user subscription model because they make more money. As this continues to unfold and large customers who have not yet moved to cloud/subscription model will have their hands forced by Microsoft and basically not have a choice but to do so. MSFT profits are going to soar and we're going to be eating tendies. I do not know how long this will take in terms of seeing it reflected in stock price and revenue, probably a couple of quarters after it is implemented - again October 1st is when the hikes become effective. Maybe some June 2019's $130's if you are feeling froggy. I am going to do something, just not sure what yet. ",0

‚ÄúIf Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion ‚Äî a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations ‚Äî his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion‚Äù

Margin Increase - Tesla Inc.
 
 
Dear Client,

In light of the current trading environment, IBKR will be increasing the margin requirement for all Tesla Inc. (TSLA) products (Stock, Equity Options, Futures and CFDs).  The first in a series of margin increasing steps is scheduled for May 29, 2019.   

Trading accounts holding Stocks, Equity Options, Futures and CFDs should expect the margin requirement to increase to a minimum of 40%, up from its current level of 30%. Please note that in risk-based accounts other house margin charges may increase the margin requirement above the 10% indication. The increases will be implemented in a series of gradual steps over a 10-day period in order to allow traders to adjust their portfolios and/or capital positions accordingly.  As such, traders should plan on the minimum margin to increase 1% every day, starting after the US close on Wednesday, May 29, 2019, and concluding after the US close on Friday, June 7, 2019. 

As the effect of this change is portfolio-dependent, we strongly recommend that you review the impact of this change before its full implementation on Friday June 7, 2019, and arrange to have sufficient excess financial capacity to absorb the expected margin increases and take action, if necessary, to ensure margin compliance throughout the implementation period in order to avoid liquidations  

To evaluate the impact of this change on your portfolio, please utilize IBKR's Risk NavigatorSM to understand how margin will change based upon the current holdings in your portfolio, as well as to determine the margin requirement for any portfolio that you may elect to construct/test. To evaluate the impact of this proposed change on your margin requirements, please see KB2957 and, from the margin mode setting, select ""TSLA Margin 20190607"".

Consistent with our stated policy, an account that is unable to carry the positions under these new margin requirements will be subject to liquidation in order to bring the account into margin compliance.",0

"AMD Analysts Are Missing Potentially $5 Billion in Free Cash Flow in their EstimatesI‚Äôll try to keep this quick.

Per AMD‚Äôs pro-forma combined 12/31/2021 closing statement filing with the SEC [Link to SEC Filing](https://ir.stockpr.com/amd/sec-filings-email/content/0001193125-22-123652/d354388dex993.htm) for the AMD+Xilinx company, they will now have $27B in intangible assets to amortize over the coming years (‚Äúwrite off‚Äù as non-cash expenses as people love to say), resulting in significantly less taxable income. Assuming a corporate tax rate of ~20% that will now be avoided, that can be worth up to **$5.4B in tax savings or $3.25/share in non-GAAP (cash) EPS.**

A majority of intangible assets are Product Technology ($12.3B) and Customer Relationships ($12.3B). Product Technology can be written off over 12-20 years and Customer Relationships over 2-15 years, so the actual present value of these savings is variable depending on how quickly they amortize these assets. 

Say all you want about tax code, but **this is 100% going to result in increased free cash flow for AMD**. 

I haven‚Äôt seen this explicitly discussed in any analyst reports and reached out directly to a few analysts that cover AMD and have confirmed they have not included this in their estimates. 

If I‚Äôm right, AMD could be in store for some serious earnings beats coming up. Fuck the IRS.",1

"Thoughts on first Options trade: Sep 21 '18 $350 Put(NFLX). Closed with $3.3k USD profit.TLDR: held NFLX puts for one week. Cashed out at around 60% gains. Not sure if I'll do it again.

Screenshot of trade at: https://imgur.com/a/6I6Tjy4

I wanted to offer some thoughts from my week-long first options trade. I thought this might be interesting to people who are on the fence about buying options.

**Bought Sep 21 '18 $350 Put(NFLX) on June 20th, price 10.74.**

On June 20th, NFLX was trading at around 412 (&gt;200 P/E). I've been thinking about buying puts on it since it was trading at 350. So I thought this was as good a time as any to jump into options. So I bought 5 contracts at 10.74. (Note, I have a long-term equity position of &gt;500k. It was not a huge gamble for me.)

**Rest of the week of June 20th**

I think NFLX rose quickly to ~416 that week and my puts were down to ~9 at some point. I was beginning to think it's too easy to lose money with this.
Looking back, the rest of the week was uneventful even though I occasionally got excited about ~10% movements in quote price. 
The puts closed at around 10 on Friday. I thought I might as well see how it goes the next week.

**Monday June 25th**

As you probably know, Monday was crazy. There was fear that Trump will limit Chinese investments in tech and all shits hit the fan.
NFLX quickly fell below 390. My puts were up to ~17-19 range. (It wasn't a happy morning for me though, b/c my long term holdings were down &gt;15k from the pullback.)
NFLX was stabilizing at around 384. All of previous week, I was anxious about a big loss from first options trade. So I was thinking it's better to make a quick profit rather than risking big loss from my first trade.
On the other hand, I didn't want to close the trade so soon because I really thought that NFLX was vulnerable, and there is a chance that it could crash further. So I took the middle road and sold 3 contracts at 17.95 at about 11AM. (The price was selected to make back my initial investment. i.e. the 2 remaining contracts are pure profits)

Not much happened in rest of the day. I think the puts had a high of ~19, so I sold at a pretty good price.

**Tuesday June 26th**

It seems all worry about Chinese investments are gone. NFLX shot up &gt;4% in one day. My puts were down to 12. I regretted not selling at ~18 when I had the chance. Oh well.

**Wednesday June 27th**

NFLX was over 400 again, my puts were down to 10, 11 at some point in the morning. I was beginning to feel sad about missing out on more quick profits. I couldn't decide between bagholding or cashing out for the 2k profit.
Somehow, there was some new fear about trade policy in the afternoon, NFLX quickly fell to ~393. Volatility must have rose a lot too, b/c my puts quickly rose to ~17.
At this point, I've had enough of the volatility. So I sold the remaining 2 contracts at 16.75. 

Later in the afternoon, I think it rose to &gt;19. Oh well. Don't really regret the profit taking.

**Conclusions**

Things that went well:

* timing of the buy was good. It was just before the Monday pullback.
* happy with the quick profit taking from first trade, good learning experience without much trauma

What I didn't expect:

* NFLX is just too resilient. It was holding/rising even as nasdaq falls.
* Volatility is so high even for Sept contract. I don't know how FD buyers do it.

At this point, I think the anxiety from volatility is not worth it. Might not buy again.

Hope that was not totally a waste of time.",1

SPY traded in a downtrend with rounding bottom potential. We did see the dreaded 20 MA (currently at 368.30) rejection today.

https://preview.redd.it/hskomkjhb6u91.png?width=1456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f505b234524fd81511d211e3992455693d90c1ed

SPY opened up with a lower high and rejection off 370. We then moved down and tested 200 MA on 2 min - trading in a triangle. In the triangle, we rejected the anchored VWAP and slipped through the 200 MA. We backtested the 200 MA at about 8:00 UTC-6 and rejected, hitting 360.97 target on scalping chart. For the next hour, we traded in a h&amp;s pattern. Full measured move from neckline break was 357.89 and we hit that EOD.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&gt;Stocks in the United States fell after a report showed that year-ahead inflation expectations increased for the first time in seven months. The Dollar rose while Treasuries fell.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The S&amp;P 500 finished near the day's lows, down more than 2%. The growth-sensitive Nasdaq 100 fell the most, dropping nearly 3% as Treasury yields rose, with the 2-year rate returning to 4.5%. Both indices experienced their first weekly declines of the month.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Equity markets fell sharply after a University of Michigan survey found that year-ahead inflation expectations rose in early October, while the long-term outlook improved. The increase may be concerning for the Federal Reserve's efforts to keep views anchored. It also comes on the heels of data released the day before that showed a key measure of consumer prices accelerated to a 40-year high in September. However, stocks roared back from early losses on Thursday, in one of the biggest reversals in history.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
In the most recent Fed comments, officials indicated that they are prepared to raise rates more aggressively than previously planned. Kansas City Fed President Esther George stated that the terminal rate may need to be raised in order to cool prices. The San Francisco Fed's Mary Daly stated that raising to restrictive levels and to between 4.5% and 5% is the most likely outcome.  
Forecasts released last month showed rates reaching 4.4% by the end of the year and 4.6% the following year, up from a current target range of 3% to 3.25%. Following strong payrolls and hot inflation readings, swaps traders have increased bets on rate hikes over the past week, with the market leaning toward back-to-back jumbo hikes at the next two meetings and a high above 4.9% next year.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Bonds and the Sterling fell in the United Kingdom, capping off another turbulent week. Gilts fell as Prime Minister Liz Truss confirmed a reversal on a planned corporation tax freeze. On Friday, the Bank of England completed its emergency bond purchases, purchasing ¬£1.45 billion in long-dated and inflation-linked Gilts. Following that, 30-year yields rose 23 basis points to 4.78%, following a drop of more than 30 basis points earlier.

# Need to know market risk - Financial Juice

&gt;Fed's Bullard: The appropriate rate range should be in the 4.5%-4.75% by the end of the year, with any further increases in 2023 being data dependent.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The UK is in talks with US LNG producers about major purchases - Sky.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
UK's PM Truss anticipates that UK's Chancellor Hunt will agree to no more U-turns on the UK tax package, according to person familiar with the matter. (Sterling weakened)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Fed's Daly: 4.5%-5% is most likely the top Fed Funds Rate, and then hold it there.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
For the first time since March, US 1-Yr inflation expectations have risen.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
University Michigan Sentiment Prelim Actual 59.8 (Forecast 58.8, Previous 58.6) (DXY &amp; 2 Yr Yield strengthened, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Gold weakened)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
UK's PM Truss: We have decided to keep increase in corporation tax.

It‚Äôs decision time. Do we reverse or do we continue this leg down to 342 - 336 range?

We are near .618 (356.57) retracement from Thursdays low. If we hold this range on Monday, then we head back up to test 370. Break 370 and I believe that we will see 380 - 384. This scenario would close the 10/26 window.

Lose 356 and we head back down to test lows, and hopefully hit that 342 - 336 leg.

*Looking to the downside to try to get this leg down to 336.61 by Oct. 26 with low-end 325.64. This would put us around 1.618 - 342.52 - trend fib from Aug. highs and around pre-covid crash.*

  Nvidia Tumbles After Supply-Chain Woes Hurt Revenue Forecast

By Ian King and Mark Gurman

(Bloomberg) -- 

Nvidia Corp., the largest U.S. chipmaker by market value, slid in late trading after Chinese supply-chain woes and the war in Ukraine weighed on its sales forecast. 

Revenue in the current quarter will be about $8.10 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday. That compares with an $8.44 billion average analyst estimate. Gross margin, the percentage of sales remaining after deducting costs of production, will be about 66%.

The outlook reflects the continuing supply-chain chaos in China, where lockdowns have disrupted production and transportation lines. That‚Äôs made it harder for companies like Nvidia to capitalize on still-growing demand for chips. Nvidia also cited Russia, which invaded Ukraine and drew widespread sanctions earlier this year, for hurting its outlook.

The shares fell as much as 10% to $152.20 in extended trading. Nvidia‚Äôs stockhad gained 5.1% in regular trading on Wednesday, but remained down 42% for the year -- the victim of a broader rout afflicting the chip market.

Investors have grown concerned that the surge in demand during the pandemic years will fade, setting up one of the industry‚Äôs hallmark boom-and-bust cycles.",1

"Stop buying AMD CallsHey guys,

A lot of you don't know me, as I don't usually post here. I'm usually over at /r/AMD_stock posting DD there. But I'm posting here because the recent activity in the stock led me to realize a huge, glaring problem with the stock's performance and it's latest earnings.

Let me step back a bit first.

Last Friday the stock plummeted 12% after posting the best earnings it possibly could have posted. At AMD_Stock, we usually brush off the post-earnings crush and continue our bull plays (or the smarter ones wait until after earnings to get back in). But this post-earnings crush was different. For this earnings, there was zero fundamental reason why the stock should go down. The earnings were excellent, the margins were excellent, the guidance for 1Q21 was incredible, and the guidance for FY21 was almost double what the street was expecting. Yet the stock still went down. It went down from $94 pre-earnings to almost $84....*on the best possible news*. 

What more could the street have wanted? Did shareholders want a +60% revenue increase YoY, instead of just +40%? Did they want 3x year-over-year revenue in 1Q20, instead of just 2x? Did the street expect us to beat our FY20 targets by more than they anticipated? Did investors want the fab capacity issues to be completely resolved earlier than 2Q21? Did they want Milan to be released earlier than March '21? Was there any reason to sell off after an earnings as incredible as that? You could even see the [bewilderment](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/01/27/full-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-on-q4-results-product-pipeline-demand-and-more.html) on Lisa Su's face as she started an interview with CNBC the morning after.

Why? [No financial news](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/amd-stock-q4-2020-advanced-micro-devices-earnings/), not even [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/amd-amd-earnings-q4-2020.html), could pin a 'reason' on the drop.

And then I realized the problem. It's you.

You buy the cheapest AMD weeklies you can and hold them through earnings like it can't go tits up. You hope that AMD beats all expectations, and that the stock price skyrockets on your tendie-train choo-choo-ing to the moon. Post-earnings you sell your OTM calls just as they go ITM to some suck-ass broker-dealer, and go do some hookers and blow and make a golden shrine to Mama Su and thank her for your amazing luck. Good thing those stupid broker-dealers were so desperate to buy your calls just before expiry.. you would have bankrupted them if you held on to them any longer!

The day after earnings comes and you wake up and the price is down 5% and dropping. You sell immediately, because you can't see it recovering by Friday, when your calls expire. This causes MMs to sell the shares they bought as a hedge against selling you your calls. Stock goes down further. Other people sell their calls, and MMs sell more shares to reduce the hedge even more, on and on until Friday expiration rolls around and bag-holders let their calls expire worthless, along with their hopes and dreams.

Stop losing at AMD! How? *INVEST PROPERLY*

How? Buy and hold shares or LEAPS. Stop chasing the mythical overnight gains. AMD is a *long-term success* and it has [room to double](https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/l6jijo/rosenblatt_securities_says_amd_could_double_in/). DO IT NOW - Price is recovering from the crush, but are still trading at a [20% discount to analyst consensus](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amd/forecast), and at a 10% discount from it's recent highs.

Conclusion: This is a better buy-and-hold than GME, BB, or anything. AMD has grown continuously in the past 5 years and, if you read the DD on /r/AMD_stock, you'll discover that it also has an incredible growth roadmap the next 5 years.

Stop losing. Buy shares and double your money.

"Hey, retard, take that fucking crayon out of your nose, stop gambling on $TSLA, and for the love of God don‚Äôt let Elon talk you into giving him another Dutch Rudder under the table at your wife‚Äôs family reunion this year. Stop betting on horses and buy yourself a horse track.As some of you may know, Tesla isn‚Äôt the only car-maker in the world. You may have even heard of Ford? What about BMW, Mercedes, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, Chevrolet, Kia, Cadillac, Hyundai, Lexus, Mazda, Subaru, or Volvo? Come to think of it, I know for a fact some of you out there have heard of Rivian, Nio, and Lucid (you know who you are, I‚Äôve seen your loss porn). Every single one of these car makers (and many, many more) are pressing the ‚Äúbrrrrrrr‚Äù button on electric vehicles. Even the once gas-guzzling, still dick-inflating Hummer is now all electric. Jesus Christ‚Ä¶ If that doesn‚Äôt tell you things are changing, then just go ahead and stick those crayons right up your ass and ass-blast away at a dart board to make your next stock picks.

At the end of the day, I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck which car company wins the EV arms race (and you best believe it‚Äôs an arms race: [https://www.ratchetandwrench.com/articles/12176-ev-arms-race-continues-as-ford-plans-20b-investment](https://www.ratchetandwrench.com/articles/12176-ev-arms-race-continues-as-ford-plans-20b-investment) ). I don‚Äôt even own a single horse in that race. You know why? Because I‚Äôm buying the god-damned horse track.

You know what every single EV needs besides an autist behind the wheel? A BATTERY, YOU FUCKSTICK.

What do you need to make a battery? Lots of stuff actually‚Ä¶ but primarily? LITHIUM.

For those of you with less than a 3rd grade reading level, let me paint a picture for you through a few pictures.

&amp;#x200B;

EV sales are expected to nearly 6X from now to 2030 in just the US alone:

[See how the chart goes up? That means we need more batteries. Just in case, let‚Äôs go over this again. What do batteries need? LITHIUM.](https://preview.redd.it/vvteve6mesd91.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf071f095201fe135688d8e86ce64d8995deb561)

&amp;#x200B;

Here‚Äôs a projection of how much lithium we need to meet the EV demand:

[Notice how this chart also goes up? Almost like it‚Äôs related to the first one?](https://preview.redd.it/89nolvxnesd91.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1db22399b53255b83322059888c718cff685a7ca)

&amp;#x200B;

Here‚Äôs how much lithium we‚Äôve been making globally:

[I know this is going to be a lot to take in, but really focus here. The lithium demand chart up above was showing numbers scaled in 1,000‚Äôs of metric tons, and this one isn‚Äôt. Here‚Äôs an easy trick, pretend the numbers on this chart stop after the comma. There you go, you did it!](https://preview.redd.it/ekhh99aresd91.png?width=731&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dfb03fa980bc72daf43b7e622eafd9d2f846233)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we‚Äôre on the same page, doesn‚Äôt it seem like we might have just a little bit of an issue here? I realize you probably dropped that community college economics 101 course mid-term after your dad said he was disappointed in you for puking on his basement carpet again while struggling through your 5th hangover that week‚Ä¶ but even you, you scholar, probably took away one iota of understanding from the first topic of that class: supply and demand.

Alas, just in case you were distracting from texting that Sophomore in your local high-school that you wanted to hook-up with while the professor‚Äôs soulless eyes bleakly looked around the nearly empty room, I‚Äôll just go ahead and show you how lithium prices have responded:

[Yeah, line goes brrrrrr. Now it‚Äôs hitting home, right? Lithium prices are up 10X since the start of 2021 and 5X since last summer \(important to note for below\). Side note: this chart is in CNY \(Chinese Yuan\) because China currently dominates the world‚Äôs lithium market, but that‚Äôs a conversation for another time. Long story short, the world doesn't want China controlling global lithium supplies.](https://preview.redd.it/e41lshctesd91.png?width=655&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7684f6c589979e73e450687deac4d71665a9d50)

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we've had some pictures for you to look at, hopefully that convinced you to buckle up and choke down that third Adderall pill so you can focus for the next five god-damn minutes and read the rest of this so you can pass out and yarf on your own carpet one day. Take that Dad.

There‚Äôs a couple last important things to note with the charts above.

1.)  Producing more lithium can‚Äôt be done with the flip of a switch. Most new facilities take a minimum of 5-7 years to be planned, approved, and start producing. Back in May, some window-licker over at Goldman Sachs wrote that he thinks the lithium market has peaked until 2025 ( [https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/gs-research/battery-metals-watch-the-end-of-the-beginning/report.pdf) ).

Here‚Äôs what just a few others had to say about that report:

\- [https://www.mining.com/benchmark-heres-what-goldman-got-wrong-about-lithium-prices/](https://www.mining.com/benchmark-heres-what-goldman-got-wrong-about-lithium-prices/)

\- [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/3-Reasons-Goldman-Sachs-Is-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/3-Reasons-Goldman-Sachs-Is-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)

\- [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/goldman-lithium-price-forecast-sparks-backlash-in-the-metals-world#xj4y7vzkg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/goldman-lithium-price-forecast-sparks-backlash-in-the-metals-world#xj4y7vzkg)

\- [https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/](https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/)

&amp;#x200B;

But I mean Goldman‚Äôs is never wrong, right? They couldn‚Äôt possibly be releasing a report like this to sink the lithium market so they can buy more for less, right?? I mean if they thought the lithium market was going to tank for the next few years because of over-supply, they would never BUY MORE Lithium stocks right???

Yep, you guessed it. Straight from their most recent 13F-HR filing:

[This is their Q1 filing‚Ä¶ I wonder what their Q2 will have to say when released‚Ä¶](https://preview.redd.it/zwpox5ayesd91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3365cae45ac8e4ac20dab84cf2eb781d80de6c5)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, while typically I try not to condone this kind of behavior, I would like to give a special shout out to Mr. Window Licker himself to thank him for giving us the buying opportunity of a lifetime on many of these lithium stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

2.)  Lithium producers typically sign contracts to sell their product for a set amount of time (commonly one year) for a set price throughout the contract. So, going back to that handy-dandy lithium spot pricing chart, I want you to take a gander at about when that pretty little line went parabolic (hint: I fucking marked it). For those of you who are too lazy to scroll up or if you‚Äôre just unsure and want to double check your work: August 2nd, 2021. Hmm, that's about a year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do we do with this information? We buy companies that produce lithium of course and we bet an unreasonable amount of our portfolio on it to boot. Now to the part all you shit-flingers will probably skip down to: ‚ÄúJust tell me what to buy already!‚Äù Here‚Äôs a brief summary on my lithium plays and my positions.

   
 

\- Albemarle ($ALB) ‚Äì 50 Shares, two 8/19 $250C, one 8/19 $260C

o Earnings Call: 8/3 After Hours

o One of the world‚Äôs current largest lithium producers than has multiple lithium mines in production and several others projects on the way. They absolutely destroyed their Q1 earnings report and should crush it once again for the next 3-4 quarters at a minimum as profits from those beautiful new lithium contracts from last year start to roll in. They are also diversified (hard word, I know) and are involved in several other market segments, but make no mistake this is still a lithium play at the end of the day. Additionally, they are US based so they‚Äôre going to get some of that sweet sweet low-interest government money courtesy of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM).

\- Lithium Americas ‚Äì 920 Shares, fifteen 8/19 $30C, nine 11/18 $30C

o Earnings Call: 8/4 Pre Market

o Massive upside on this company as probably the most intriguing junior lithium miner right now. Sure, they haven‚Äôt made any profit yet, but that‚Äôs a pretty fucking big ‚Äúyet‚Äù. They are currently in the final stages of approvals for the largest lithium mine in North America at Thacker Pass in Nevada. Once this makes it through a final court case appeal this September it will be all system go on this project and I would bet my left nut that that will be the case here. I won‚Äôt get too far into this since I have written about it before, but there are several other catalysts on the horizon and revenues are coming very very soon. My PT on this one is $150/share by the end of 2025.  Massive upside here, don‚Äôt miss the boat. I‚Äôll likely be turning some of my earnings play profits into many more 11/18 &amp; 2/17 calls.

\- Livent ($LTHM) ‚Äì 300 Shares, two 8/19 $25c, thirty 8/19 $30C, five 8/19 $40C

o Earnings Call: 8/2 After Hours

o Another US based company with projects that are already producing. Major earnings beat in their last call and I fully expect them to blow it out of the water once again and for the next several quarters. They are heavily focused on being as green and sustainable as possible, which is an important factor in this field. I think we could see $40/share by early next year.

\- Sociedad Quimica y Minera ($SQM) ‚Äì 50 Shares (No options‚Ä¶yet)

o Earnings Call: 8/17 After Hours

o More similar to Albemarle since they are well-diversified, but at the end of the day their lithium production is one of their biggest revenue drivers. I‚Äôll probably write an article on them prior to their earnings so, I‚Äôll just say I have option plays to come on this one as well.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Do you know someone who drives a car? Well odds are, At least one of their next two cars will probably be electric. Electric cars need lithium for their batteries. Buy lithium producers and own your own god-damn horse track. God speed retards, and let that speed be electric.",0

"10-4-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisWhat an interesting day that we just had today‚Ä¶ There is a lot to unpack today. The first thing I want to touch on is the daily range of SPY today. Lets take a look 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7n48fhiprur91.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1002362aaa2287d0547940f94dd8d1aef1d228f8

According to the data that brokers supply us‚Ä¶ SPY saw a range of $11.43 with a LOD of 366.57 and a HOD of 377.66, however, SPYs actual LOD is 372.31 and a range of $5.69. So what does this mean? Well the last times this happened I coined it the ‚Äúphantom range‚Äù and everytime it has happened the price of SPY has hit that level either intraday or the next day. This most likely is dark pool prints. 

Today was also extremely interesting when we look at the buy pressure, and TRIN. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zcapwwxprur91.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e5dc94bc25c3d7a7ca6e9a840e1412bbf4c1cf

Left side is todays market data which shows that we had a legit buy pressure of almost 2500:1 on SPY this morning and our trin was 0.21 (extreme imbalanced). Then we take a look at yesterday and our buy pressure on that massive run up was 9.72 and our TRIN was 5.05 (also hella imbalanced). 

This is officially the biggest two day rally that SPY has had all year and is the biggest two day rally since April 2020‚Ä¶ so what comes next? 

Well lets look at WHY the market is even rallying like this‚Ä¶ the CNBC current news cycle is set on repeat of ‚Äúthe fed is going to pivot, December is likely the last rate hike‚Ä¶‚Äù is this true? No most likely not‚Ä¶ JPOW was very clear that we would NOT see a pivot or rate pauses until 2024 most likely. But with BOE and now Austria slowing its rate hikes/ starting QE‚Ä¶ markets are rallying on this news. 

There is a chance we are about to go on a massive rally for the next 2 months till the November rate hike and JPOW finally talks again. That or we are seeing an extreme bear market dead cat bounce and the shows about to come to and end soon. Most of the bear market bounces this year are around $20 for low to high‚Ä¶ we from Fridays low at $20.96. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eoefi5fqrur91.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a7b12d0ed958d1707c38d02a8dc30dc7f4e8775

Okay here is the above chart with less lines to make it clear on what im trying to show‚Ä¶ We are looking like we are in a pattern just like the March to may sell off followed by an aggressive rally that led to consolidation and then a bigger dump (when CPI hit). I wonder if this pattern is about to play out again. That dump was a bounce form the 75% retracement to the 50% retracement‚Ä¶ consolidation then dump to the 2022 bear channel support (around 330-340 depending on timing). 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3pl1q2xqrur91.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ce5cf94e8207fc4a517888cbb9e379cba0e4c05

Today we saw SPY with a massive gap up (however, due to the phantom print this gap is now covered) over the daily 8ema and we stopped right at the 20ema. Most of these dead cat bounces have also stopped at the daily 20ema. So we are at a major pivot point here. 

There was on the 15min chart 14 attempts to break 377.3 resistance before it finally in the last minute popped through and closed over it. 

If we see a 3rd day to this rally I will look for resistance of the black bear channel to be tested at 382.2 which is also next resistance. The one thing I am seeing is that this looks very similar to the September 7th to September 12th dead cat bounce. If we look at the stochastics also you can see that we are hitting the same overbought levels that we did back then. While we might get one more push up I do suspect we see downside the end of the week. In order to trust this rally I would like to see 370.6 support back tested and held. 

Key support- 375.4 (black support line vbottom) -&gt; 372.4 -&gt; 370.7 -&gt; 366.7

Key resistance- 378 -&gt; 381.4 (black bear channel resistance) -&gt; 382.2 -&gt; 386.2

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/738g8lhrrur91.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53f3e8222aef43eb16fbc4148465565bf90399e9

Futures did break through its key black falling wedge resistance. The next major resistance would be up in the 4000s which uses the august and September peaks. Futures also rejected the daily 20ema at the EOD. Unless futures opens green and never loses 3805 support we are going to see that support line broken finally and that could lead to more downside. 

Key support- 3805 (black v bottom) -&gt; 3770 -&gt; 3735

Key resistance- 3880 -&gt; 3925

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/daomo9xrrur91.png?width=1003&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd54541c114bc3bd691fc097d68f57b4448663ad

I am seeing a hanging man candle formed on the Apple daily chart with a rejection of the Daily 8ema. With the phantom print on SPY we are seeing a massive hanging man on spy and the similar one on Apple. Look at the May 17th candle on spy for an idea of what COULD happen. 

Apple rejected 146 9 times before it finally closed a 15min candle over it EOD. However, even with that close it still is below its daily 8ema. Due to the daily candle structure unless apple opens over 149.4 (2.2% green and holds that all day it will break support and should open the downside). With SPY and Apple I am looking for a double top at 378 and a double top at 146 with a bigger retracement. 

Blue bear channel resistance comes in at 148.8 tomorrow which is just below key resistance of 149.4. 

Key support- 149.4 (black v bottom support) -&gt; 142.5 -&gt; 141.3 -&gt; 138.2

Key resistance- 146 -&gt; 147.6 -&gt; 149.4 (major resistance) 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zdyj74gsrur91.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed20bd65dd67af48931f45dac8cf6211d93d6405

And then there was Tesla‚Ä¶ you gotta love the way this stock moves. Tesla actually looked fairly bullish this morning breaking over yesterdays HOD and looking to test that red falling wedge resistance near 260. However, then ole ELON decided he is gonna buy the twitterpade and well we saw tesla go for $10.86 sell off in less than 15minutes and a total drop of $13.25 over 1.5 hours before it actually attempted to gather some support EOD. I was blessed enough to have some Tesla puts but not blessed enough to get an IV pump on them‚Ä¶ Despite teslas impressive drop it actually closed a green day and was able to get over 248.7 resistance that it struggled at for over 11 candles before finally like SPY and Apple EOD was able to close over them. 

Tesla is peculiar. As it still remains one that has the most to lose as it‚Äôs the furthest from its 52week low. Tesla has now also suffered back to back days of ‚Äúbad news‚Äù. Being in the inverse head and shoulders pattern the pattern needs to see 220 to ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù I do suspect we could see it play out this week. 

Today could have definitely been seen as a ‚Äúrest‚Äù day after Tesla got absolutely beat down yesterday. Breaking 242.5 will be the confirmation of downside to come and a close over 255 would signal a possible bigger bounce to test that black bear channel. A breaking of that red support for the falling wedge will be an early signal of the reversal. 

Key support- 242.5 -&gt; 237.3 -&gt; 231 (black bear support)

Key resistance- 250 -&gt; 252.4 (red resistance falling wedge) -&gt; 255 -&gt; 260.6 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w4dbn9zsrur91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=408068e51fe535684efd9bfeb0cc6d54d2369cb8

The VIX in all reality did nothing today. It did hold key 28.3 support and the daily 20ema. However, it closed under 30 for the first time since September 23rd. One thing that I am seeing though is a gravestone doji candle body. This appears to have occurred in similar fashion back on September 9th which then led to a massive upturn (granted this was CPI day). 

There is a very big potential with the VIX not unwinding at all on this massive green day on SPY that we could see the VIX revert back to 31-32 tomorrow which would take SPY down and the markets with it. 

10% challenge-

Some of my least favorite days to trade are days we have massive gap ups at open‚Ä¶ when we have back to back days of gap ups with extremely weird technical (trin, buy pressure, vold, etc. etc.) I know there is little risk to reward. I played a morning tesla put when I saw weakness in Tesla and was reward thanks to musk but I believe either way I would have been by EOW. From there I didn‚Äôt play much else besides closing my 28dte call on SPY and playing one quick SPX scalp. 

A great trader KNOWS when the technical do not favor their strategy. An even greater trader knows when not to trade and that‚Äôs there will always be another day to trade. Today to me was a clear day 

Youtube will be up later tonight!

"NVDA Being OverlookedEveryone knows that NVDA and NIO are partnering to develop EVs, but I haven't seen near the hype about NVDA that I have with NIO. Maybe people don't realize it, but along with the chips that NVDA will be providing, the AI provided by NVDA is crucial. Autonomous driving relies heavily on AI, and data is currently the most valuable asset in the world. 

Looking at some TA, NVDA has been consolidating in a flat base pattern (weekly chart) for several weeks now. The flat base pattern was formed on low volume, and there hasn't been much institutional distribution from the stock. It's basically been waiting for a catalyst to explode and this should be it.

Of course, NVDA options are expensive as shit so I'm looking at shorter-term otm options with decent volume to buy at market open. I really like the 2/19 $600 strike ($7.90/contract) or 3/19 $700 strike ($4.50/contract). If you're not broke like me then close-to-ITM options for about any date should work.",1

"This should be a very simple answer about AMZN Q1 but I cannot understand itSo as has become apparent, AMZN stock fell over ten percent after Q1 earnings call. 

Most sources say this is due to a non-operating loss of [7.6B from their Rivian](https://www.investopedia.com/amazon-q1-fy2022-earnings-report-recap-5270247) holdings (which is a publically traded stock, and has been showing a steady decline in value over the past quarter losing 54%.)

"AMD News is priced in...I literally know nothing about AMD and am pretty tech illiterate so take my advice with a grain of salt. I‚Äôm seeing two camps around AMD: those who know technology who think AMD is going to be super hot and give intel a run for their money and those who think it‚Äôs ‚ÄúpRiCeD iN‚Äù already.

This reminds me a lot of Dominos Pizza to be honest... Back at the tail end of the financial crisis, some friends of mine saw that Dominos (DPZ) had finally come to their senses and changed how they did business- they turned their production process and recipes on their head in order to actually make a product that people wanted to buy and weren‚Äôt just ‚Äúsatisfied that they bought a cheaper alternative to better pizza‚Äù. Except for the pizza part, does this Sound familiar? 

So anyway, DPZ had gone from $4 to $11 as they went from near bankrupt to actually competitive with a good product. We bought in at about $11 once the product was getting good feedback. We SOLD it at $13-14 after scalping a 20% gain. We figured the good news and the improved product was pRiCeD iN already, we had made our money, and the stock had essentially tripled in a year. 

Whoa were we wrong. Every time the stock doubled or tripled we said it was priced in already and there was no point in buying it back because the trend was likely over soon because pizza is competitive and there is no moat and well funded competitions...

Anyway- this situation just reminded me of what I‚Äôm seeing arguing about AMD. If they really are making a better product than the competition (I‚Äôm too stupid to understand if that‚Äôs true or not), ride the freaking wave.",0

"7-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily TAWelcome to the officially unofficial 2022 recession! I hope we all survive‚Ä¶ cause the markets and the feds do not care if you or I do! 

Okay so I have a few things to say about where we are at right now and where we are going and how to play these future days. I hope I am correct and I hope that we all make a lot of money. 

https://preview.redd.it/9mtzkll2jde91.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a829c13c3e54ebeccedb6b1b3626bf3b1c599b6c

Okay first off I want you to take a look at the March FOMC meetings data and todays FOMC data‚Ä¶ kinda interesting if you ask me. We had similar days yesterday and today was identical. Now lets take a look at the Daily chart and see some interesting correlations‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/gt9ppd23jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27acf0fd4e865d23478b92dedbafa0bb7fc35cd0

https://preview.redd.it/xopj4hn3jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0216a7ee5afd3032b32f46697d4d34ee70b5b2cc

https://preview.redd.it/5urcbk74jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c2ef12809a7a07c19d2687ed75761a154692302

Okay take a look back at march I have highlighted with a blue arrow and a ‚Äúthe day before march FOMC meeting.‚Äù If you look at it there is clearly a trend there where we bottomed the day before fomc and from there if you look at the candles they are nearly identical. So what does that mean? Well it means to me we are about to go on a even bigger bull run then we are currently on. Okay hear me out here for a second‚Ä¶

In March we had a meeting and then we had no more meetings until May‚Ä¶ we are currently in July and have no meeting until September. We are looking at a nearly identical trajectory and base as then. If you remember back to march it was the simple buy calls on the morning dips and let it eat. This morning I was very tempted to get into some 30dte calls and the only reason I did not get into those calls were because I knew Apple earnings were tonight and PCE was tomorrow morning. 

We are in a clear bull path towards 420-430. 

Here is a few other things to look at and think about. If you look at the purpleish blue trend line I highlighted the May 20th to June 2nd bear market rally. That rally was about 9.69% and lasted 8 days from low to peak. I superimposed that over to current July 14th bottom. Which shows that we are now tapped out on the bullrun is that‚Äôs the trajectory we are going off. Currently from the July 14th bottom we are up 9.6%. The argument could be made that we just made the top today and it is downward from here. 

Now if we are basing it off the day before FOMC meeting being the bottom like March then we look at the March 14th to March 29th 11 day rally of 11.1%. Which give us an 11 day trajectory (August 10th‚Ä¶ the day of the next CPI meeting‚Ä¶.) and a 11.1% rally which give us about 432.8 price target. 

Now this is where it gets crazy‚Ä¶. I calculated that trajectory strictly based off of the data not the chart. Now if you go to the chart and you look at August 10th AND look at the resistance line (the solid green line) it PERFECTLY correlated at‚Ä¶. 433.33‚Ä¶ 

https://preview.redd.it/tidgke35jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e442e5dc7c303b8f19e29dc7232fdb596c80c36

So am I bullish? Hell yeah. Apple looking great after its earnings‚Ä¶ why does that matter? Well let me show you why‚Ä¶

https://preview.redd.it/gxrfhjm5jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3a5208488935ad14684486cd108fb5cb64f11458

https://preview.redd.it/3d2qbg46jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7745111953aa891e93b5f13070a9115775ae881b

Here is the Apple chart‚Ä¶ what do you see? You can see we are in a CLEAR downward grey channel that we have been trading within for all of 2022. This channel uses the lows from January and May then projects that to the highest point of march. IF apple opens over 157.2 tomorrow morning (which with earnings it should) then we are about to see Apple confirm 100% that its bear market is over‚Ä¶ This would be the first time in 2022 that Apple fails to make lower highs over and over. Yes we have not broke the actual March high but breaking this channel is essentially saying the 2022 Apple bear market is now over‚Ä¶ With this move Apple is going to Guide SPY and the rest of the market higher and higher. 

Apples next price target assuming it holds and breaks over 157.2 at open will be 163.9 -&gt; 174 -&gt; 180.

The one thing to be careful about with Apple is if it opens up with a massive gap tomorrow whether that fills or not. 

https://preview.redd.it/tphgasq6jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c2954f225490cd2f28c76eb06fc50da07312c49

https://preview.redd.it/rhlqwnk7jde91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=842020edb718d2e0a009ad5209de891092ccd8dd

Here is the SPY and ES weekly charts that show just how bullish we are‚Ä¶ Tomororw bulls are going to look to close the week out over 4145/ 413. Breaking those weekly downward channels opens us up to those green dotted resistance lines with a price target of 430/ 4335 by the week of CPI. 

If you look at the green dotted resistance and blue dotted support lines they are actually forming a massive symmetrical triangle which should lead to a fairly significant breakout or break down. 

Overall with not really anything negative besides PCE tomorrow‚Ä¶ which im only even mentioning this since JPOW was so clear in his ‚Äúwe look at PCE more then CPI‚Äù during his speech. But after tomorrow morning when market opens and we see it settle I will be entering some either 14dte calls. I will be looking at some 14dte 414C according to optionstrat that will be about the best risk to reward for my price target of 433 and time frame. 

Looking at after hours right now we are up about 0.83% which will leave another nearly $3 gap on the daily down below. This would be the third on the daily chart to the downside now‚Ä¶ does that confirm we see more downside in the future? Yes I think it does‚Ä¶ one small gap I can justify leaving but I cant really justify leaving three pretty decently sized gaps on the daily chart. 

Most likely scenario is we get somewhere near that 433 price target before we reject and see further downside. 410-415 will be a crucial resistance to watch on the way up. 

Lately it appears at least for the last two weeks that we get a fake breakout in the morning followed by a sell off and then around 10 to 11 we finally find bottom and that is the optimal buy and hold call opportunity. I will be looking for this to play out tomorrow as I do suspect we could back fill the gap down to 406.8 in the morning at open before we push higher. 

It wouldn‚Äôt be unheard of to see markets open and straight rally in a trend day now that all earnings are down, gdp is apparently old news already, no fed meetings for 8 weeks and no cpi for 3 weeks. There is literally nothing to worry about now‚Ä¶

All dips are now call buying opportunities‚Ä¶

10% challenge-

A pretty meh day for me today. 

https://preview.redd.it/12t0x5b8jde91.png?width=753&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23b4d6a992ad71fc3d6b2cfaa0e88047dcae5e93

I held those SPX puts overnight expecting a pretty big dump on GDP. Thankfully was able to get out of them at the bottom this morning. Apple looked hella weak this morning and with the earnings I attempted to enter for a nice free IV pump but apparently I bought the bottom.   
 I had the perfect SPX scalp around noon when there was a big dump in volume. Was up 10% instantly. Had a stop limit order in and it didn‚Äôt fill on the way down. Never saw green again. 404 was the probable high of day and it was not quite convincing at the time we would go much higher. At least we did though and I finally took my loss. Play a SPY 1dte call on the way up. 

So far since I was on vacation earlier in the week and didn‚Äôt trade FOMC im sitting on a slightly red but manageable week right now. 

Not riding anything overnight. I was pretty close to entering those 14 or 30dte calls at market close but decided it was best to wait for apple and PCE just in case.",1

SPY went on a super impressive breakout back to 400 only to get absolutely smacked down. This was actually a super bearish close today and shows a local top in my opinion. It will take some big strength to push through 400 that is for sure. 

With this black bull channel we actually have a super steep blue rising wedge in it that we perfectly rejected resistance on today at the HOD. I am looking for a bigger retrace tomorrow. Not sure exactly how low we will go but until we can break through and close over 400 there is not a reason to expect further upside. 

Key support- 393.1 -&gt; 390.1 (key level support) 

Key resistance- 398.6 -&gt; 402

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6llij7zhzz91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c7646a43193bf7f584230ac459422274c4c8ad4

Identical pattern on futures right now too‚Ä¶ we actually came close enough on Futures to the daily 200ema to call that a daily 200ema rejection and again with these gravestone doji candles I expect this to be the local top and to see a back test of some stronger support levels like 390/ 3905 before we have a fighting chance of continuing up. 

Support- 3925 -&gt; 3905 -&gt; 3863

Resistance- 4028 -&gt; 4060

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hf8z54qzhzz91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86b89ec1b050ba73a72566ac9e698b33028a9039

Apple ran right into its daily 100ema today, however, found itself running into a brick wall and has now retraced pretty significantly. As I had mentioned last week this 100/200ema interaction on Apple is going to take some time and would be more then shock to shoot straight through. However, we could hard reject and retrace instead. 

Support- 146.9 -&gt; 145 -&gt; 141.3

Resistance- 149 -&gt; 150.5 -&gt; 153.5

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla attempted once again to break out over its daily ema and break out of this falling wedge on the daily however was once again unsuccessful. I had said last week that the 196.1 double top was in play and it sure was today. With this doji I do expect some downside tomorrow. IT did however find itself holding key support of 190.9 EOD. I will look for that support to break tomorrow and test the blue support line at 188. If we lose that support I am looking for 177.4 support retest this week. However, if we can hold support and finally take out the daily 8ema and 196.1 then we can look for the gap fill and possibly a bigger push towards 208.8 resistance. 

Support- 185.9 -&gt; 177.4

Resistance- 196.1 -&gt; 201.9 -&gt; 204.9

Lots of movement on the VIX today. Had a nice 6% green open that led to a hard sell off under that key 23.5 range. However, still not exactly sure what caused it but EOD we had a pretty big spike of the VIX that put it back over 23.5 and caused it to close its biggest green day since October 6th.

"How to trade AMZN for less than the price of one shareNoticed a bunch of noob questions about options. Thought I would outline an example of a credit spread in the form of a bull put, for any of you that have mastered the FD and are looking to expand your playbook. 

Some benefits of the bull put spread: Your risk is defined and you will know going into the trade how much you can make or lose. Also, when putting on a credit spread, the credit goes into your account right away. This will be your max gain and your goal is to keep all or most of it. 

Why a bull put spread: Choose a stock that you are bullish on. Rather than being an option buyer, you are selling the expensive put option (the short leg) and buying the further out and cheaper put as a hedge (the long leg, without this it‚Äôs a naked put and your risk is unlimited).  

[Here is a credit spread on AMZN that I opened on May 8th.](https://imgur.com/a/LKdeiQi) I sold the May 18th 1600 put for $2,758 and bought the 1590 put for $2,279 as protection. I received the difference, or $478 as a credit to my account. 

Analyze and manage your position. If AMZN closes above 1600 this Friday, I will keep the entire credit. If AMZN is at $1595, I break even. If Amazon drops, the most I can lose is $522 (the difference of the spread 1600-1590 times 100 minus credit of 478). [Here is the P&amp;L chart for the position. ](https://imgur.com/a/1v2yVwG) Notice that theta is now your friend, as long as AMZN stays above 1600. 

And that‚Äôs how you can use options to trade Amazon and only risk a few hundred bucks. If this helps anyone, I can share some other trades and strategies. ",0

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* Stocks in the United States rallied the most in nine months, with major averages rising at least 2% on hopes that the omicron variant will not derail global growth.
* Treasuries fell, causing two-year yields to reach their highest level since March 2020.
* The rebound was led by technology stocks, which led the decline last week. The Nasdaq 100 index increased by 3%, an etf that tracks newly public companies increased by 5%, and small caps increased by 2%. The S&amp;P 500 recovered all of the losses suffered following Jerome Powell's hawkish stance a week ago, and was only 0.3% lower than its previous close before the Omicron variant shook markets.
* The CBOE volatility index fell five points to 22. In New York, the dollar fell and crude oil rose above $71 per barrel.
* Risk assets are recovering this week after preliminary data showed that the surge in omicron cases has not overwhelmed hospitals and China moved to expand economic support. A Goldman Sachs group basket of non-profitable technology firms rose nearly 6% on Tuesday, recouping nearly half of last week's losses.
* In terms of data, the US trade deficit shrank, while third-quarter productivity fell. Private consumption was the most important driver of the eurozone's most recent economic expansion.

#### Commentary:

* Nice run today from the Bulls.
* I still maintain that we will see a Christmas rally if Bulls hold 462.
* Depending on futures 469.71 - 468.69 may act as support or resistance (pointed out on gap analysis chart)
* Best case for Bulls tomorrow is they establish and hold support at 469.71 - 468.69 for more upside.
* Base case for Bears is they fill all of the gap (463.68 - 460.59 - 459.15) tomorrow as quickly as possible.
* **Expecting a dip tomorrow - look for gap fill to hold for downside risk**

#### Levels:

* Micro support: 466.09
* Gap fill: 463.68 - 460.59 - 459.15 \*Please note that we could find support at these levels)

"9-27-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market AnalysisAs exciting as it is to live through these ‚Äúonce in life time moments‚Äù they are getting quite old. Today we just closed our 6th red day in a row‚Ä¶ This is something that has not happened since the Feb 2020 covid crash which saw 7 red days in a row and dropped 15.7% over that time period. 

SPY currently has fallen 7.4% over 6 days now. Kinda crazy to think we have had 6 red days in a row for the first time in 2.5 years yet we have only fallen half the distance that the covid crash saw. However, since August 16th (30 trading days) we have seen a total drop of 16.5%... falling just a few % short of the March 29th to May 20th 17.7% sell off over 38 days before we finally saw a meaningful bounce. With SPY officially putting a new low of year in here, the VIX making a new higher high (breaking the downward trend started in January) its hard to be bullish here especially with from what I have seen besides the CPI -4.35% red day I haven‚Äôt felt ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù or that fear pumping scary that the bottoms never coming sell off. 

CNBC on Friday mentioned that historically this is the ‚Äúworst week of the year for stocks‚Äù with the weekly only being down -1.24% total currently‚Ä¶ and some -5% to -6% red weeks to compete with‚Ä¶ I wonder how this week is going to finish out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at SPY weekly here we have the black downward channel still intact, we have a blue falling wedge forming and we also have a red falling wedge forming inside of that falling wedge. 

The one thing that I am really seeing here though is that the red horizontal channel with resistance at 370.6 was broken underneath on September 23rd and we have now rejected that resistance 3 days in a row and made a new lower low each day. I am actually a little surprised that when we made a new official low for the year that we didn‚Äôt just see a face melting dump. We consolidated for almost 3 hours around that 362 level. I do wonder if we are about to see that level broken and see the 350s for the first time since November 2020 tomorrow. Despite the now 6 red days in a row‚Ä¶ I have a hard time being bullish while SPY rejects 370 and make a new low for the last 11 days straight. 

Support- 362.1 -&gt; 360.2 (red support) -&gt; 358.2 (blue support) -&gt; 355.4 -&gt; 352.3

Resistance- 364.3 -&gt; 365.6 (red resistance) -&gt; 368.2 -&gt; 370.6 -&gt; 373.7 (blue resistance and gap fill)

Taking a look at futures we are seeing a fairly similar pattern with the black bear channel and the blue falling wedge. I have highlighted two arrows (in blue) where we could be at. Looking at the trend of two days of sell candles followed by a gravestone doji we could be starting a two day bigger sell off tomorrow. Looking at trends generally when a gravestone doji like todays candle pops up on a downward sell off it usually leads to a continuation not a reversal. I do suspect further downside. I would be bearish based off futures as long as we are making lower lows, closing lower lows and as long as we hold under 3770. 

Key support- 3635 -&gt; 3615 (blue support) -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3545

Key resistance- 3670 -&gt; 3706 (blue resistance) -&gt; 3770

Looking at apple this morning once again‚Ä¶ which has been trend for the last week‚Ä¶ we have seen nothing but strength from apple and tech overall. Today however, we did see weakness in the tech side of things with the exception of Apple, Tesla and Nvidia. However despite an early morning breakout attempt we saw weakness end of day and did see apple even flash red momentarily. With a break of that potential V bottom support we should be looking at further downside. 

I was as I called out yesterday (before VIX rocketed and SPY made a new lower low) that we would see a potential breakout with a inverse head and shoulders. AS of now that is technically still intact, however, if Apple loses 149.2 that will negate the pattern. With Apple attempting to break out, closing its 4th doji daily candle in a row, and failing to close over its daily 8ema 3 days in a row I would suspect downside to come. 

The thing I am waiting for now that SPY put in a new low is for the tech sell off. SPY is at the 75% retracement of its 2022 bear channel with apple still holding at 50% retracement along with Tesla. Tech is in far better shape then the general stock market and SPY. We have seen a NYSE driven sell off for the last week. The reason in my opinion we haven‚Äôt hit capitulation and we haven‚Äôt been seeing 3-4%+ sell offs is because people have not abandoned their tech positions yet. If and when tech finally loses support and loses its buy pressure that is when SPY will put the bottom in and that is when we see the worse week in market history play out. As long as Apple and tech in general hold semi bullish‚Ä¶ this is likely to be a slow burn sell off. 

Key supports- 150.7 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 147.1

Key resistance- 152.4 -&gt; 154.5

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla is another one that I was expecting could see a bigger breakout despite a looming downward pattern. With the rejection at daily 8ema and rejecting/ closing below 283.9. I suspect with that big 4 day sell off last week followed by now a 2 day dead cat bounce is about to see its next leg down. Which if Tesla truly is on its next leg down here that means tech could be the catalyst of doom for SPY and the markets. 

Tesla actually had a ton of movement today with a total of $11.16. Being up almost 4.5% and down the lowest I saw a +0.7% closing up 2.51% may seem like a victory for the tesla bulls, however, to me this showed weakness. I will be keeping an eye on that 283.8 resistance tomorrow. As long as Tesla holds below that I am bearish. Once and If we break through 270.3 support I think that will trigger that bigger sell off I was alluding to. 

Support- 270.3 -&gt; 264.4 (50% retracement/ black falling wedge support) 

Resistance- 283.8 (falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 292

&amp;#x200B;

Just when I finally said it was time to give up on the VIX and it was no longer pertinent to my everyday trading‚Ä¶ it goes and makes itself important again. Today actually was an extreme bearish day overall technical wise. Not only did SPY put in a new lower low for the year we saw the VIX break its black dotted bear channel resistance line that dates back to January 24th 2022. This means the trend of the VIX continuously making lower lows has been broken. The VIX is now pushing higher and higher. Many people have been saying true bottom is not in until we see the VIX hit 40-50‚Ä¶ I am not saying that is what is going to happen but this is the highest the VIX has been since the June 16th previous low. The question now is will the VIX attempt to make a 52week high (38.94) tomorrow, or is the VIX reaching max fear levels and much like January, March, May and June when the VIX breached 33.7 the top was in.

I am pretty indifferent here. On one hand historically speaking for 2022 making a new low on SPY, and VIX breaking 33.7 is a time that we should consider going long on some Calls. However, I haven‚Äôt really seen that big flip back to bullish sentiment, and we have not seen tech catch up (more like drop down) to the sell of intensity that SPY is experiencing. 

The next few days are going to be interesting on SPY and you can expect with the VIX over 32 again for high volatility and unpredictability. 

10% challenge-

You know honestly not my best day today‚Ä¶ I had some 1dte and 3dte calls that were hella red overnight that I swung. Was able to close the 3dte naturally for a nice win at open and then a quick average down at open got me to breakeven on the 1dte calls. 

From there it was downhill for a little while. I was still under the impression that we were going to be seeing a green close today and I was also under the impression that the bottom was in and that we were going to take 370 out finally. I was very wrong. Thankfully EOD I was able to get on board and able to close out a decent week day. 

This is one of those days where being TOO biased to start the days and being ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù than the markets can really hurt you. The best thing I did today was having hard stop loss price targets for my calls. I was able to recognize I COULD be wrong and that if I WAS wrong it was time to GTFO before a manageable loser became an unmanageable loser. 

I am very indifferent where markets are going to go from here. On one hand I really do think we could see the 340s-350s this week and on the other hand we are hitting some extreme levels on SPY and the VIX and we very well could have just put the bottom in. I really don‚Äôt know where to go from here‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs why when in doubt we don‚Äôt swing and why for the most part I recommend intraday plays. 

Overall I think as long as tech holds support (Apple closing over 149.2 and Tesla over 270.1) it is hard for me to be full bear. But in a market as volatile and vulnerable as now anything can happen overnight.

"AMD strong upside for this week.I honestly should have posted this last week because the trade is already in progress, but there is probably still time:

**The DD:**

AMD has strong upside for this week. There are two basic reasons for my view on this.

1. Fundamental points:
   1. Strong earnings reports over the past 3 quarters.
   2. Despite strong earnings, no real price spike. Been hovering between 80-90.
2. Technical points:
   1. The stock cross the 9-day moving average on 2/8/2021
   2. The stock formed a golden cross on 2/8/2021. This is very important because this stock has tried to form a golden cross 2 times previously and failed to do so within the past few weeks. However, this time it has formed the cross and it's continuing to go.
   3. RSI is continuing to trend up, indicating there is still gas for positive price action.
   4. Crossed 50 day moving average on 2/10/2021

&amp;#x200B;

[Top is price action on 9-day. Middle is MACD. Bottom is RSI. If you don't know what these terms mean then please look them up.](https://preview.redd.it/7hj2tc6jbrh61.jpg?width=659&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7859d033c6af8f430eddefcfd30d7960da6a2bf1)

Basically, on the fundamentals this stock is ""due"" for a push up. On the technical side, we can see that it's starting to go up.

Overall, the 9th would have really been a good time to enter the trade because most of the elevating factors had already formed. And now with the futures up it's likely going to open up a lot higher, but still I see room to go up.

**The exit strategy:**

If you do decide to enter this trade, and it does become profitable for you, here is how you can look to get out.

1. On the MACD, when the **green bar goes from a dark green to a light green just sell the stock.** The simple view is this: dark green means strong bullish, light green means it's reversing to bearish. Dark red means bearish. Light red means reversing to bullish. Obviously this is overly simplified and subject to exceptions - but it's the general rule and if you know it you're better off than if you don't know anything at all.
2. If you want to stay in longer (because obviously none of this is guaranteed) you can wait until the price moves close to the 9-day moving average. Once it moves under that then I'd take all my money off the table. 

I use technicals as a piece of trading stocks, but I tend to never base an entire decision on trading stocks. Charts are useful because they give me more information and help me make decisions based on what is actually happening in the market. Essentially, they prevent me from making emotional decisions and allow me to think in a cool and collected way when I trade.

"2/14: SPY the ole pumper and dumperWell today was quite the interesting day if you ask me. We saw a very vulnerable and sensitive SPY today. We saw early morning future dip near 436 before recovering to green at open. The fed president spoke on CNBC around 830a and essentially said a whole lot of nothing but did say inflation was worse than expected. Markets than began their sell offs. We seemed to had established a pretty clear and cut downward trend making lower lows from around 945 am to 1115a. Then the market got its first bit of wild reaction to news. The feds dropped a ""consumer inflation"" survey which supposedly showed that consumers thought inflation wasnt that bad and would be better by end of year.... markets reacted positively and took off for the higher resistance... burning us put holders.

Just when we thought we were going to test the upper resistance line of 444... we got ""news"" that the US was evacuating the embassy in Ukraine and apparently tanks were seen at the border... markets went spiraling down and broke the low of the day landing near 435.3.

Then they say JUST KIDDING THERE IS NO TANKS... and markets ripsawed back towards the highs rejecting at one resistance line near 440.1... we then finished essentially flat closing the day red down 0.33% at $439.02



So what did we learn today?



Well we learned there is a clear resistance line that will need to be broken near 441.6. We also saw despite the flat day we did see a lower low on the daily.



Overall 5 out of the 5 last mondays the daily candle finish has predicted the weeks finish... it will be interesting to see if we finish red this week or not.

Support lines to watch

438.9 --&gt; 436.26 --&gt; 434.24 --&gt; 432.15 --&gt; 427.27

Resistance lines to watch

439.5 --&gt; 440.2 --&gt; 441.5

Tomorrow we still could go either way and we very well could see another sideways day. Right now we do not have any bullish and we dont really have any bearish catalysts to propel the market either way. One interesting note today was that QQQ/ Nasdaq was green while SPY and DOW was red most of the morning. Nasdaq managed to finish green despite an overall red (but flat) market.

Postions-

I sold my 2/18 441P i picked up friday for a 5% loss and I sold my morning 2/16 438P for a 15% loss both during the 1115a market pump.

I also sold a 2/16 440C for a 5% loss right as market was dumping at 115pm.

Overall portfolio-

P/L %- 95

P/L- $3000.

What did we learn today? We learned that in a market like this 10-20% gains are king. Had i just taken profits at 20% and been satisfied this morning I would have been far better off. Nonetheless we all still struggle with greed and wanting more. Today though i will say we all experienced an unfortunately fake pump and fake dump because of the news.

We have to remember on fustrating days like this that no matter how good we are and how careful we are the market sometimes is going to do unpredictable things. We never FOMO in and we never revenge trade. we manage our losses appropriately and live to trade another day.

I hope everyone enjoyed the live intraday discussion today and i will be holding another one tomorrow.

"Inverse WallStreetBets; Meta/FB as a long term growth investment**My initial disclaimer:** 

Meta is not a traditional/standard WSB quick play. I'm not suggesting anyone buy any at this time; and I don't currently hold any myself. This is a 5-10 year play; and if you're looking for somewhere to park some money over that time period I am predicting 500-1000% gains in that time period. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bear's Thesis:** 

* A. They are a dying company used exclusively by boomers
* B. Changes to data collection policies by Apple and Google handicaps revenue
* C. The Metaverse is a poorly thought out attempt to pivot business strategies. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Disputing these thoughts; and why I'm Bullish**

1. **Available user data does not reflect that Facebook is dying; or that it's user base is primarily boomers.** As of October of 2021, Facebook had **2.9 billion monthly active users** (\~36% of the world's population) -- over the 13 quarters prior; Facebook has ALWAYS posted growth. 

* Analyzing that user base; 
   * 66% of those users login every day, 
   * **Median age of users is 31** 
   * **\~60% of users are between the age of 13-34.**
* Analyzing traffic
   * Facebook is the 3rd most visited Website on the internet (behind Google and Youtube)
   * 11.2B visits per day by 1.5B unique visitors
      * The next most visited Social Media site is Instagram (which is FB) at 2.9B and Twitter at 2.4B visits. **Facebook gets \~5x the visits by about \~2x the unique visitors.**
   * \~22 minutes average time per visit
   * \~6 pages per visit 
   * **THIS TRAFFIC DATA DOES NOT REFLECT MOBILE APP VISITS, JUST BROWSER VISITS**

2. The fact that Facebook gets 11.2B visits a day by 1.5B unique visitors means that while Apple/Google cutting off mobile data collection may have some impact on FB's revenue; **they still can obtain an enormous amount of data from browser access**. 

3. In 2022 the Metaverse is an outlandish concept that most of us (myself included) can see absolutely no value or utility in. Up to now VR has been a novelty with little application outside of video games and porn. It isn't wrong to be skeptical of this. **BUT** as of now Meta is way out in front on building an all encompassing virtual reality platform; and has cemented themselves as **THE** leader/gateway for anyone looking to develop a virtual reality product. If you need any confirmation bias that there is potential for value; Google which companies are investing in/working on/becoming a part of the Metaverse. **Facebook's Metaverse has a high probability to be for VR what iOS and Android have been for smartphones.**

&amp;#x200B;

As for why I believe Meta will see 500-1000% gains over the next 5-10 years:

&amp;#x200B;

The iPhone began development in 2004, was released in 2007, and reached most popular status in \~2011. In that time Apple's stock price (adjusted for splits and approximated for an annual value) was \~$.48, $5.40, and $12.10 respectively. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now comparing that to the intended timeline of Zuck's Metaverse: Development began in 2021/22. The development timeline that I typically see for release of a product resembling a genuine VR worldscape is \~5 years. We'll call it 2027. Zuck is predicting 1 billion MAU on the Metaverse by 2031. If we apply the same price movement that Apple achieved with the iPhone; Facebook's current price \~$210 rises to \~$2,400 in 2027, and reaches \~$5,300 by 2031. I appreciate that comparing those price movements is an extremely non-scientific method for prediction and that there was a lot of other shit going on with Apple in that timeframe; so I've applied a 50% reduction to those increases for the sake of conservativeness and we're still left with a share price of **\~$2,150 in 2031.**   


TLDR:   
FB is still growing and primarily used by young people

FB has more than enough browser based traffic to keep its data supply without Apple/Google's cooperation

VR is a realistic/legitimate growth industry ; and FB has positioned themselves to create the iOS/Android that the rest of VR is run on. 

Price target is $2000 by the end of 2031. If it doesn't hit mods can ban me.",0

"Getting Technical: SPY DD(10/2/19)Drill Spy the Buy Puts Guy here with some technical analysis on $SPY in preparation for Wedneaday, October 2nd. 

*Safety glasses on*
.
On October 1st, $SPY(-1.19%) saw it's biggest one day drop in over a month off of weak manufacturing news.  President Tariff Man's outlook on trade talks has changed to a much more negative tone the past few tweets, and it seems the impeachmeant news has him thrown off his stonks game. 

    If he can regain his focus and use his tweets to pump efficiently, we may see SPY rebound by the EOW, but as of now, he seems more focused on attempted pumps on auto stocks nobody gives a fuck about. Unless Trump regains his true bull self, expect SPY to continue it's downtrend for the week considering there has been literally zero positive political or economic news this week. In other words, the stock market is ON FUCKING FIRE. 

As for October 2nd, look for $SPY  to rally at open. If it breaks 294.25 early, expect a flat-to-mildly green day, before a big drop the rest of the week. On the opposite side, if we break through 293.00 on the downside, expect all hell to break loose and $SPY to close around 290. 

In conclusion, barring Tariff man going full Bull Gang, expect another red day tomorrow because there is absolutely no fucking reason for a green day at all. Buy puts motherfuckers cause SPY is gonna DRILL! DRILL! DRILL!

As we stand here we mourn the loss of fantasies. Fantasies of a profitable trade, a profitable portfolio, paying rent, and even starting a family.

"What‚Äôs Bad for AMZN is good for WISHYesterday, Lina Khan, a vocal critic of Amazon, was sworn in to lead the FTC at age 32. 

Khan played a crucial role as legal counsel for the House antitrust subcommittee‚Äôs 16-month investigation into the Big Tech giants, and in producing the 400-page House Democrat report that alleged that all of the tech giants engage in anti-competitive practices and need to be reined in.

Khan burst onto the scene in antitrust circles in 2017 when she penned a legal paper dubbed ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Antitrust Paradox,‚Äù which spread widely among proponents and critics alike.

The Federal Trade Commission also continues to probe various Amazon business practices to determine if Jeff Bezos‚Äôs corporation is violating antitrust laws.

"Daily option statistics for WISH, AMC, BB, GME, CLNE, CLOV, WKHS, CLF, TSLA, and others.Hey guys, 

Its time for the daily option statistics. Holy $WISH with a pump of almost 20%, great job to anybody who got some of that action. Other then that pretty much everything else was down around 4-6% with the exception of CLF which gained 3% on the day. 

Good job to anyone who got some of the action today.

## Micro Symmetrical Triangle with Bullish Bias

* Lose 451.29 and the pattern is null
* Needs clear 452.96 to be viable.
* If we can‚Äôt clear 452.96 then the pattern shifts to double top. If we see a strong rejection, I‚Äôll be looking for 450.66 as a downside target.
* Bullish üéØ 454.26 - 456.38
* I‚Äôll be looking to trim 90% of positions at the 454 range and leave runners for the full measure (if it can get there)

## Uptrend Break to Downside

* Lose 451.87 - 451.50 and look for 450.17
* Lose 450.17 and look at the pivot at 448.37
* Bearish üéØ 447.17 - 444.09
* Finding support at 448.37 will put us in another rectangle. Thanks, Theta.

Notes:

* Neutral 440-449. Bullish 450+. Bearish at 439 and below. Want to see us close above 450 next week for a few days to be bullish.
* If we get near 448-450, I want to see if buyers come in - if they do, I believe we will finally get the full measure by the close. If they don‚Äôt, then I‚Äôll look to 445-444.
* All else fails just trust the levels and measured moves, trimming or taking full profit at half measures and leaving runners for full measured moves.
* The 1-Day Netfow looks bearish so this does give me pause to increase positions at the open, especially if we have a substantial gap up open.
* Daily RSI - bullish. 65 min RSI - bullish - near overbought. 15 min. RSI - bullish near overbought.
* Bearish diversion on the 15 min. for what it‚Äôs worth.

EDIT: I forgot you guys can't read - TL;DR: short term üöÄüöÄ, long term = big ‚¨áÔ∏è. A good way to look at it is - to increase in value Tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky. For the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once, or maybe not even at all. 

Before I start let me make it clear that, while I do eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner I am by no means an expert and this is hardly a *serious* DD like some others I've seen here before. This is just my opinion and my take, do what you will you beautiful retards

Also - I like Tesla, and I respect them a lot. I love that they made electric cars S3XY, and I want one, but God damn if they aren't insanely overvalued. I'm betting against the stock, not the company. Let's just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand - Tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer (+Lyft) COMBINED. I love their cars, but dude holy FUCK. You absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond. So let's talk why this action today is expected, natural, and IMO, only sealing Tesla's fate towards reality.

First - Tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago. Elon even admitted as much [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html). While they have done extremely well since then, and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand (especially Q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 BILLION USD from $3B), this worries me more than encourages me. Why aren't they spending this cash on future R&amp;D efforts, paying down debt, making even more factories (yes yes India I know, but MORE), charging stations, battery tech, or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks non-stop despite Coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit (barely) their delivery targets, etc? Tesla already has mega churn because Elon/'the culture' burns people out, and a bonus would be super well received I'm sure. Nope, they buy some digital currency (you know the one). Look, say what you will, Elon is a bit of a weirdo. Love him, but man if he isn't unusual for a Billionaire visionary, and that move was definitely weird for a large(ish) corporation to do with so much money given they're so young, relatively unproven (compared to other auto makers, at least in the eyes of the boomer clan) and looking to aggressively ramp up production. To me, it shows they don't have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash, so they'd rather drive traffic to sales via, well, a meme. That might be a genius move, but it's definitely non-standard and doesn't speak to confidence in new development coming easily. This means, at least to me, with Tesla, what you see is what you get. They don't have any huge surprises coming, or new products lurking that we haven't already heard about (robotaxi lol, $25k car, etc). They don't have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out, and they aren't aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead. Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, etc all have EVs on market this year, and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing EV demand. They're behind, but not for long. They may be slow giants, but they didn't get there for free, and they have been there that long for a reason. Finally, EV is the future for now, but what if in five years it's hydrogen, or fucking fusion, or maybe even some bad stuff happens with EV and everyone wants ICE again - Tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once - might make them slower, but it's also less risk, and they're not THAT slow seeing as they're already on the market. It is legitimately retarded to count those auto-makers out. At that point just roll your 401k into Robinhood.

Second - let's talk Tesla fundamentals (ish). I'm not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because I am a moron and I don't know how. What I am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers. Here is what Tesla (currently) sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from: Cars (duh), Solar roof/Solar wall, Robotaxis eventually, Insurance eventually, Semis eventually. People like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be (maybe, maybe not, time will tell), and I'll talk about that in a second. 
Cars, duh, Teslas are dope as hell. They have had their issues in the past, but they're sick and people want them. Demand is there for sure and growing rapidly, I won't deny. BUT, others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards EV. Meaning, when the old, crusty ass MFs who don't know ""What's an electricity"" decide they want an EV, they will have SIGNIFICANTLY more choice as consumers than you or I today if we were to go car shopping. This will, undoubtedly, pull away from Tesla sales. You can assume that Tesla somehow magically doesn't lose any interest in a field with increasing competition, but this just isn't reality. People like new things, and companies that make new good cars will see sales. Tesla is that right now, will they be that in the future? I'm not certain. See production scaling concerns above. To really assume they won't lose any consumer interest despite growing competition, they'd need to be pumping out multiple different models. I'm talking a non ""cyber"" Tesla truck, some sort of hatchback/sport crossover, maybe even an 'adventure sport' rig like an EV 4 Runner or the EV Hummer that's coming out. Americans like big cars, it's a fact. Just because it's an EV and saving the planet doesn't mean consumers want to sacrifice - this is why Tesla was and has been successful, because they finally made an EV that wasn't fugly as shit and a laughing stock, but if they don't continue to drive innovation into existing ICE sectors with EV tech, they're going to get left behind. Tesla is gonna want to capture this market share, and they haven't even hinted at it so far. I don't know specific numbers, and I don't think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt, but Tesla isn't going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future EV sphere unless they really buck up. If anything, by not doing these things now, they're backing themselves into a corner and a specific 'look' that might be hard to shake later.
Next: solar things. Solar wall and roof are dope, but they're not cheap, and pretty niche right now. It requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place. There's also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now. We *could* see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy, in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable, but it's still a matter of scale. I don't know their production numbers but with how little I've heard about it, I don't think they're huge, and if demand spikes, they won't be in a great place to capture it if they aren't scaling appropriately (see cash concerns above). 
Now let's talk Robotaxis and Insurance. Insurance is a dud, that's not big money. Maybe I'm not just a retard, but also an idiot, but I truly don't think Tesla offering insurance does ANYTHING positive for their bottom line. The way I understand the proposition is that because they're so confident in their self-driving tech they would become your insurance company, insuring you if FSD made any mistakes. This is a lot of liability forrrr nothing. They can't really take payments for it, unless it's well below what consumers pay now for insurance, otherwise are they really so confident about their tech? If that's the case, insurers will drop rates and lay off employees/close locations to meet those rates because a) they like money and b) it's even easier money than now if they're less likely to pay out. At a certain point, Tesla's ""insurance"" is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for Tesla. They take on a lot of risk, and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isn't too high (AND after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this), otherwise they're taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain. Robotaxis are equally dud-ish. Again, maybe I'm just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people. Even though people bitch about other people, everyone bitched about being inside/away from society during Rona and never seeing anyone. Some people like those random interactions you get with a real person, and some people just truly don't trust robots. Both of these take away from potential customers/market share Tesla is likely to see from Robotaxis. Also old people and tech don't generally mix. Getting better, but still, old people and robots likely won't be a hot seller. Further, regulation and the required insurance/warranty/coverage whatever for this whole operation won't be quick or cheap. What happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out (asleep or faints) in your Robotaxi? What happens if it does happen to get in an accident, or if it gets a flat tire? What happens if the address is wrong, or someone needs to change where they're going? What if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesn't respond, or what if they aren't a native speaker or are disabled (mute, deaf, blind, need assistance getting into trunk or into/out of car)? How do these situations get handled? Finally - not everyone wants to have random people in their car, especially without supervision. What if someone trashes your car? Or pisses/shits/pukes in there while they're drunk? Sure Tesla or whoever might cover you, but Robotaxis won't clean themselves. Further - what about charging? The cars won't charge themselves after they're done with their 'shift', so unless you're able to go out and plug it in, what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home? Guess you gotta wait. Not saying it's impossible, just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk. And here's the kicker - it's not even a super profitable industry. Uber is operating at a loss and they're the defacto millennial ride calling service. Lyft and Yellow Cab still exist, among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like Asia. Europe is much more walkable IMO so it's not *as* popular from what I've seen, but in major cities (London) sure it still is. Overall Robotaxis aren't really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for Tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots. Plus, if everyone has a Tesla, who the fuck is riding in the Robotaxis? Even if you assume somehow Tesla starts being like USPS or Amazon and delivering packages/groceries/becomes a god damn short bus, there still will be competitors and it's still not as easy as saying 'but it's the fUtuRe'.
Semis - I don't know shit about shit here, but I haven't heard much more than a peep about this, so I'm naively assuming it's not a huge corner of Tesla's business projections for the future. Maybe Tesla becomes the Daimler of EV and sells only big ass EV Semis, but I doubt it. I don't see this being a huge money maker, perhaps I'm very wrong.
Lastly batteries - lots of people like to say how Tesla's batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors, blah blah, but I don't really buy this. Their tech may be really good now, but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming HARD for the money in the EV sphere. I don't want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech - but SOMEONE will. People like money, a lot. If these companies don't figure out how to build their own batteries like Tesla, someone will. And here is where Tesla's battery strategy becomes not super useful - Tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries - if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to Tesla's, they will likely end up a lot cheaper (eventually, not immediately) because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other EV makers, (standardizing in the process no less) not just the batteries Tesla needs. And if that never happens, it means the EV makers made their own, which means they are confident enough in their own cost/performance/etc, and Tesla really isn't that far ahead. I know Tesla has a big advantage here now, but that doesn't mean people who worked on Tesla batteries won't go work elsewhere for more money, and it doesn't mean these other companies won't hire young and hungry Masters and PhD grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to Yale. In fact, that tech is probably already being developed in Ivy League labs for fun by those exact types of people for their PhD and Professors using their grant and research money, hell some boy scout in a garage in Iowa might be doing it right now. Tesla may be a leader now, counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid. Everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $1500+ is either completely braindead, irretrievably stupid, or not paying any attention whatsoever. They're assuming Tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and they're the golden child forever. Look, I like Tesla, but no matter what endeavor they go after, someone else is gonna go for it too. Tesla may end up being better at it, but that doesn't make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesn't mean everyone will use Tesla's stuff. Some people don't like the brand, some people don't like Elon, others may just like other stuff more. 

Finally, look at the ""anatomy of a bubble"" and compare it to Tesla's stock chart. It's shockingly similar. I know, I know, that's moronic, but I'm a moron and a üåàüêª so what can I say. The other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is Radio Corporation of America circa 1930. Radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the FUCKIN FUTURE dude. So shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie, turns out radio wasn't the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be, and stock prices tanked. This has happened with every bubble, ever. Everyone thinks they're invincible, everyone thinks this time is different, everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong, ever (Cathie Wood √§hem √§hem), but every. single. time. they've been proven wrong. Fundamentals always matter, and Tesla ain't there chief. Finally - Graham, Dodd, Buffet, some of the most legendary investors/investing advice people EVER whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions, warn about 'buying at any price, assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in you'll make money'. This sound familiar? How about those ludicrous price targets of $1600/share? Sound reasonable? Unless Tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole (and I don't just mean ICE to EV retards), their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked.

There's a few catalysts that I can think of as well - some bearish, some bullish. 
For some bullish ones: UK announced Uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors, meaning their profits will be hurt. This does mean good news for Robotaxis, if and only if they can actually make them work profitably. Further, ""loos-id"" (don't think I can say this name here) is going public and Rivian is slated to go public this year as well. If these companies, or NKLA, or NIO or some other companies have significant and public blunders, Tesla stands to gain. 
However - some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they DONT fuck up, they're just more competition in an increasingly crowded space. More choices means less profits for Tesla. Also, in case you guys forgot, Tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights. They don't offer 401ks and they have been staunchly anti-union. Further, Elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders, and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home. He might not have been directly involved in this, but Tesla sure was. While those have already eclipsed, it isn't a promising outlook for the future, and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout. I'm not saying they're gonna miss targets, but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strike/rebel and want more representation/compensation/work life balance. This would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins. Further, with a democratic party leading all branches, and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions, companies like Amazon and Tesla that don't treat workers well may see legal/punitive backlash from the government if they don't change things themselves. I for one would be *popcorn meme* watching AOC and Elon duke it out on twitter over something like this. Also, Tesla is opening a new factory in India and there are factories in China, but these might not be as great as people think. India is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there, along with China and the Uighurs. I would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues, which could spell bad news for Tesla. These countries are great new markets, but like the USA, they also have their own car manufacturers and other EV players - Tesla isn't going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out.

So all of this paints my pretty grim picture for Tesla's stock price, but here's where I do my retard math. If you look at Yahoo finance for Tesla's book value, you get like $20/share. This takes into account all of Tesla's assets and liabilities. Now Tesla could take on more liabilities/debt in order to fund more R&amp;D and drop their book value by doing so, but here's the thing - they have like $16B cash on deck to do that, and they haven't. I don't see them taking out massive loans that haven't been 'normal business procedure' for them in the coming year(s). So, take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50% year over year for 5 years straight (which would be fucking insane). This gives you like $154/share Book value. Now, let's look at their peers and their sector. EV as a whole is in a bubble IMO so I don't think it's really legitimate to compare to their EV peers (EV is the tech bubble, Tesla is the specific 'stock issue' in question affected most heavily because of name/brand recognition). So, compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or I have been alive (Toyota, VW, BMW, Honda, Daimler, Suzuki, Ford, GM) the average price to book ratio of those companies is 1.16. Tesla's is 35.25. If you take the insane growth figure I listed before (which represents 50% YoY TRUE growth in the company - averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value) AND you add on a 125% INCREASE of the P/B ratio (so 225% raw) compared to their peers (this assumes they're 125% more pricey than their closest competitors, after insane growth for the next five years, meaning we're assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for Tesla) and you price all of that in TODAY you get a value of $401/share. Tesla is almost double that today. 

In my opinion, Tesla's true value lies around $100/share. With an assumption of 20% YoY growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50% increase of P/B relative to peer average (Tesla is the P/B sector leader with this factor added on), you get $75/share. If you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better, call it $100 or $150. This 'book value' (and its growth expectation) wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of Tesla bulls like to point to saying how Tesla is supreme and much better than companies like Toyota which literally fucking created 'Lean Manufacturing' (it's called ""the Toyota way"") that transformed not just auto manufacturing, but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general. Put up against that, Tesla may be a maverick, but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition. Anything more than $200/share and I think you're truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history. 

So where does that leave us, today? Well, Michael Burry, despite being pretty crazy, is actually pretty brilliant, and has been skeptical/short on Tesla long before I decided to jack myself to the tits (quantity wise, not so much cost) on cheap premie puts. I don't think anyone can truly time a bubble, and the actions that the Fed has been taking, along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any 'top' well beyond its natural range. I could get totally fucked because of this but whatever, I didn't throw in more than I can afford to lose so whatever happens, happens, plus as a üåàüêª I'd probably deserve it anyways. The selloff that has happened over the past week I believe is the start of the 'blowoff' phase. We're on the way down now, it's just a matter of how long it can hang on, IMO. The big dip yesterday was our 'local bottom' until we ramp back up to the 'back to normal' section. If you're long Tesla, personally, I'd sell there. I do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two. I'm not an expert but I'm guessing in about a week or two we're back up near $800-820 and that'll be about the peak. After that, I think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level, wherever that ends up being (between $90 and $1600 if you listen to analysts, really insightful shit, really narrows it down). The bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to, and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals. I might be wrong about the timing, but I'm as close to certain as I've ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $200 levels in the next year. If I'm right, I'm buying a Tesla.

Positions - lots of 3/19 puts at different sub $300 strikes. Planning on buying more cheap OTM short term puts every month until this stock goes down or I go bankrupt. Sadly was a greedy fuck and didn't sell one 2/26 $590p during the big dip yesterday

If we assume the trade wars decline for the market will last as long as the they did during late May/Early June, then the bottom of the dip will be sometime this week.

"Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) both reported weaker than expected earnings for Q2. Jim Cramer says """"I think Google and Microsoft will be good tomorrow"" Alphabet reported weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue for the second quarter.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

**Earnings per share (EPS): $1.21 vs $1.28 expected, according to Refinitiv**

**Revenue: $69.69 billion vs $69.9 billion expected, according to Refinitiv**

**YouTube advertising revenue: $7.34 billion vs. $7.52 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

**Google Cloud revenue: $6.28 billion vs. $6.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount.**

**Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $12.21 billion vs $12.41 billion expected, according to StreetAccount**

Revenue growth slowed to 13% in the quarter from 62% a year earlier, when the company was benefiting from the post-pandemic reopening and consumer spending was on the rise.

Currency fluctuations from a strengthening dollar knocked 3.7 percentage points off revenue growth, CFO Ruth Porat told CNBC‚Äôs Deirdre Bosa. Porat said the strength of the dollar will hit next quarter‚Äôs results even harder.

Porat also characterized the current outlook as one of ‚Äúuncertainty in the global economic environment.‚Äù

Advertising revenue increased just 12% to $56.3 billion, as marketers reeled in their spending to manage inflationary pressures. The most notable deceleration was in the YouTube division, where sales rose 5% after jumping 84% in the same period a year ago.

Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/alphabet-is-set-to-report-q2-earnings-after-the-bell-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/alphabet-is-set-to-report-q2-earnings-after-the-bell-.html)

Microsoft shares rose 5% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software maker issued a rosy income forecast for the year ahead, despite issuing quarterly results that failed to reach Wall Street consensus.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

**Earnings: $2.23 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.**

**Revenue: $51.87 billion, vs. $52.44 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.**

Microsoft turned in the slowest revenue growth since 2020, at 12% year over year in the quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. The company‚Äôs earnings per share fell short of consensus for the first time since 2016, with net income rising 2% to $16.74 billion.

With respect to guidance, Microsoft called for $49.25 billion to $50.25 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue. The middle of the range, at $49.75 billion, implies about 10% revenue growth, reflecting worsening PC sales and slower cloud infrastructure growth. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected more, at $51.49 billion. The company‚Äôs implied gross margin, at 69.85%, was wider than the 69.30% consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount.

And for the new 2023 fiscal year, the company reiterated its forecast from three months ago, despite the economic climate.

"AMD or IntelAMD, NVIDIA or Intel right now?

Thoughts between them below, given the recent 4090 BS, EVGA partnership loss, AMDs supposed amazing GPUs coming soon, Intel's upcoming chips, etc. 

I think AMD is going to come out strong toward the end of this year into next year - Between the BS nvidia has done with the 40 series and the (hopefully) amazing price to performance that amd is reportedly bringing, plus the uplift the new ryzen chips are getting compared to intel.... yeah i feel like AMD is in a position to really increase it's market share by massive amounts on both fronts. I don't see a recovery plan for NVIDIA right now given the inflation and TSMC price increases ontop of the cost to produce the 40 series AND the backlog of 30 series cards lol.... As for Intel, eh idk i just feel like ryzen is going to top the charts this time around and intel will struggle to keep up - In regards to price to performance specifically, but that is left to be seen.",0

I did a calendar spread on NFLX before earnings (opened last week). I sold the 7/19 370 Put and bought the 7/26 370 Puts. Classic right?

&amp;#x200B;

Well I nailed it on earnings. Thankfully I closed out from 10 contracts to only 2 long and 2 short before they declared earnings. I'm guessing in everyone's panic to cover their short puts expiring Friday before they got exercised this caused the weekly to increase 300% whilst my put with a bit of time value only increased 150%. Technically 100% loss however I still own these puts to exercise so I'm covered right? Worse case risk-less exercise and I lose the premium I paid

&amp;#x200B;

Got a notification at 10PM Mountain time that ""My order for 200 NFLX has executed at 370"" and immediately go OH SHIT and check my account.

**Exhibit 1**

March 21st a compensation package valued at 2.6 billion will be approved for Musk. This package will grant him over 500 million dollars for market caps reached at 100 Billion and at 50 billion increments above that, vesting 1% of the shares outstanding per increment up to 12% of shares outstanding. It is reliant on market based milestones, which musk can influence with his public brand and on acquisitions to further integrate the company as a renewable energy company. The exercise price is that of TSLA shares on Jan 18 2018, around $350. Additionally the vesting is reliant on operational milestones involving increased revenues and EBIDTA. The operational requirements may be achieved through aggressive accounting practices and wouldn't be hurt by strange depreciation accounting that would improve FCF. In the current compensation plan, Musk is required to have TSLA achieve 30% or more in gross margins for several consecutive quarters. We have instances of capitalisation of expenses that has helped get TSLA‚Äôs margins close to that number in previous years. If Musk believes or sees that these milestones are unreachable, even with the zeal that he can inspire in his followers, he may very well jump ship. When you realise that they don't expense R&amp;D as cost of goods sold then you realise what is being done to inflate the gross margin figures.

**Exhibit 2**

SolarCity acquisition should have been illegal from a corporate governance point of view. Six of Tesla‚Äôs seven directors have clear ties to SolarCity. Tesla‚Äôs board includes SolarCity‚Äôs former CFO, a SolarCity director, and two VCs whose firms also have seats on SolarCity‚Äôs board, along with Musk‚Äôs brother, Kimbal. Musk chairs both companies and is SolarCity‚Äôs largest shareholder. He has taken out $475 million in personal credit lines to buy more shares in SolarCity and Tesla when advantageous. SpaceX, his aerospace company, has purchased $165 million in bonds issued by SolarCity. Some analysts cautioned that Musk might be self-dealing, rescuing his own investments and his cousins‚Äô company through this purchase. Hedge-fund manager Jim Chanos, who had shorted Tesla and SolarCity, called the acquisition a ‚Äúshameful example of corporate governance at its worst,‚Äù a ‚Äúbailout‚Äù of SolarCity that ‚Äústrikes us as just the height of folly.‚Äù SolarCity was not doing well, Chanos believed that it was on its way to bankruptcy, with its bonds yielding over 20% by the time that they were bought.

**Exhibit 3**

Musk‚Äôs public popularity raises valuations of the companies who he attaches himself to. He has been touted as the world‚Äôs Tony Stark. Just go to YouTube to watch the drivel that fanboys post about him. Recently and notably, Youtuber boyinaband has begun to celebrate Musk with his audience and the amount of absurd ‚Äúthug life‚Äù and ‚ÄúMUSK DESTROYS‚Äù compilations on youtube is beginning to rival that of Jordan Peterson.

**Exhibit 4**

Along with these liquid stock grants that further dilute shareholders, TSLA equity finances a lot, especially, it seems, when they assure shareholders that they have no plans to. They also issue a lot of debt, and are not transparent with their plans to raise capital. When asked about TSLA capital needs in last year‚Äôs Q2, Musk responded, ‚ÄúAnd now that said, there may be some wisdom in having a cash cushion for unexpected events. You just never know if there's going be some significant force majeure events in the world. It could be an earthquake in California, for example. But we're not at this point considering an equity raise. We are thinking about debt, but we're not thinking about an equity raise.‚Äù Considering that the Company announced the debt raise less than a week later and is already on a roadshow, management was clearly well past the ‚Äúthinking about‚Äù stage at the time of Q2 earnings. In fact, the Company seems already well on its way to a raise in contacting debt rating agencies and planning for a roadshow. Readers can determine whether Tesla‚Äôs representation during earnings call was accurate. There are many other instances of this kind of behaviour by TSLA management, and is not a credit to their credibility. Their only positive cash flows come from financing activities and they now have a D/E of 2.22. It is clear from a quick look at their cash flow statements that even in 2017 they are raising far more debt than they are paying back. Also they keep claiming in their 10-K that they are innovative manufacturers, and are supremely safe, meanwhile they have to borrow Panasonic employees and are hand-assembling batteries, and they change their production forecasts downwards many times a season.



**Exhibit 5**

They are becoming increasingly unprofitable as their revenues scale. This is highly unusual as one would expect that fixed costs would begin to be spread as they scale. This points to a break even point at lower rather than higher than current sales volumes given the current infrastructure. This of course would run completely contrary to their plans of becoming an all round provider of sustainable energy vehicles and other products. Their interest expenses have also more than doubled moving into 2017, with precipitous increases in SG&amp;A expenses. These lower incomes are not as a result of higher R&amp;D costs, as those have risen less than proportionally. Their EPS fell by 200% from 2016 to 2017.

**Exhibit 6**

Other than Elon Musk, CFO Deepak Ahuja and CTO J.B. Straubel no other executives are listed on its website, its investor relations page or in the annual report filings. Over the last year over 30 Executives and directors have left the company including chiefs in accounting and the CFO and the head of the Autopilot engineering division. This is an especially bad sign and is the hallmark of a failing company.

**Exhibit 7**

TSLA are no longer leaders in the most vigorous part of automobiles, which is autonomous vehicles. Among the largest market cap automobile manufacturers, TSLA has relatively unsophisticated autonomy in cars so far, trailing even behind GM. Considering that they were touted as pioneers in this field, with their first forays with NVDA, this does not bode well. Also given the lack of scrutiny that investors place on Musk, most likely the stock price still has expectations of leadership in autonomous vehicles baked into the price.

**Exhibit 8**

Many other incumbents are catching up to TSLA in high end EVs, and already has a presence in economy EVs segment. The market is very competitive and there is no reason to expect that TSLA will become leaders. Also TSLA has huge reliability issues according to TrueDelta.com, ranking as the most unreliable car purchasable in America.

**Exhibit 9**

Tesla may not be eligible for the subsidies granted by the government, given that the Model S pollutes more than a Jeep on a per mile basis in the US, when accounting for the pollution in production and recharging.

**Exhibit 10**

Tax credits in the US will no longer benefit TSLA in its Solar Energy provisions post December 2021. The services that they provide will no longer be tax exempt for residences. Expenditures only include set up costs, set up services are also provided by TSLA. By 2025, economic benefits for electric cars will also disappear in Norway if gas cars become banned. People will then flock to other auto manufacturers producing electric cars as the demand for TSLA exceeds supply.

* Quoted from the 10-K risk section:

&gt;We currently benefit from certain government and economic incentives supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicles. In the U.S. and abroad, such incentives include, among other things, tax credits or rebates that encourage the purchase of electric vehicles. In Norway, for example, the purchase of electric vehicles is not currently subject to import taxes, taxes on non-recurring vehicle fees, the 25% value added tax or the purchase taxes that apply to the purchase of gas-powered vehicles. Notably, the quantum of incentive programs promoting electric vehicles is a tiny fraction of the amount of subsidies that are provided to gas-powered vehicles through the oil and gas industries. Nevertheless, even the limited benefits from such programs could be reduced, eliminated or exhausted. For example, in April 2017 and January 2016, respectively, previously available incentives in Hong Kong and Denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicles expired, negatively impacting sales. Moreover, under current regulations, a $7,500 federal tax credit available in the U.S. for the purchase of qualified electric vehicles with at least 17 kWh of battery capacity, such as our vehicles, will begin to phase out over time with respect to any vehicles delivered in the second calendar quarter following the quarter in which we deliver our 200,000th qualifying vehicle in the U.S. We currently expect such 200,000th qualifying delivery to occur at some point during 2018. In addition, California implemented regulations phasing out a $2,500 cash rebate on qualified electric vehicles for high-income consumers, which became effective in March 2016. In certain circumstances, there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interests to bring about such developments, which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicles.

This will all further fuck their shitty cash flows.

**Exhibit 11**

Reservation deposits are another way to finance the company.

**Exhibit 12**

Verbiage is relatively extravagant, overstating or emphasising features of their products that are not differentiating and are completely expected given their sector. For example their use of inverters, that they write their own software, make their own UI, the autopilot feature which is reportedly not better than many competitors and the fact that their power storage is infinitely scalable. Also they claim that they have core competencies in powertrain engineering, vehicle engineering, innovative manufacturing and energy storage, then they disclose in the risk section that they HAVE NO EXPERIENCE TO DATE IN MANUFACTURING VEHICLES IN HIGH VOLUMES. Clearly they are not competent in their core competencies. In producing the Model 3, they were so incapable of meeting demand that some of the production line is by hand, there were constant bottlenecks, quality control employees were totally inexperienced is automobiles. Batteries could be defective and management apparently didn‚Äôt care. Apparently their stress tests aren‚Äôt efficient either.

**Exhibit 13**

Solar City‚Äôs lease agreement model is highly risky for homeowners to agree to, it puts their house to a commitment to pay rising prices for a technology whose efficiency and cost is decreasing in the long term. It‚Äôs like buying a 20 year bond when you know rates are going up, it‚Äôs totally retarded and becomes a huge liability on the house when you need to sell it, because only a braindead idiot would want to buy a house on which they are forced to pay a coupon out to Solar City on a less than optimal solar rig. It‚Äôs like a subprime lending company. And Solar City won‚Äôt be able to compete against highly subsidised and technologically advanced solar manufacturers like DQ in China in the regular solar panel sales market. They have no claim on the residential market. Also it‚Äôs worth mentioning that Elon‚Äôs cousins run the company, and Elon is majority shareholder. So he basically bailed his family out of this shitty company when he bought it. It‚Äôs as cancerous as Goldman Sachs.

**Exhibit 14**

Out of warranty, Teslas become extremely expensive, especially since the way they‚Äôre built and service policies require less modular servicing. The battery costs 12000 dollars to replace for the Model S, and 40000 dollars for the Roadster, door handles cost 1000 dollars to replace each, and apparently they‚Äôre highly unreliable, 5000 dollars to replace the touchscreen which can become discoloured or even misaligned leading to freezing. Drive unit replacement would cost 6000 dollars out of pocket, which is composed of the entire so called power train, this is the source of the lack of modularity in repairs. Also TSLA does not support the used car market very well, apparently parts for salvage vehicles are impossible to acquire for ‚Äúsafety reasons‚Äù, even though competitor electric car makers do provide salvage parts, and it is not possible to see the service history of a used car.

**Exhibit 15**

Tesla has a penchant for forecasting very unrealistic production numbers. Their forecasts for weekly production at the beginning of the year were 5000 units of the Model 3 per week by Q2. They said they‚Äôd have this production rate by mid 2017 before, and now they're making about 700 units a week, when they said they'd pull off 2500 by the end of Q1. Also TSLA has started issuing VIN insequencially, so it is more difficult to track production rates and service rates of newer vehicles.

**Exhibit 16**

While most investors are aware Tesla had received 518,000 Model 3 reservations as-of early August, 63,000 of which had been cancelled (12.16%), few know the problems Tesla has faced trying to get their own employees to convert Model 3 deposits to reservations. Tesla and SpaceX employees placed an estimated 13,000 Model 3 reservations and Tesla was counting on this army of employee beta testers, bound by NDAs and the threat of being fired (or worse, losing their stock option grants) to beta-test the Model 3 without leaking details to the public. Quite surprisingly, on November 15th Tesla sent out the first batch of Model 3 configuration invitations to non-employees (Electrek reported non-employee configurations on November 21st) with the first known non-employee VIN assigned November 22nd and the earliest confirmed non-employee delivery on December 20th. Based on Tesla‚Äôs fourth quarter production and delivery press release, a total of 1,892 Model 3s had been produced prior to December 21st - indicating the estimated 13,000 employee Model 3 reservations translated into perhaps 1,500 firm orders (11.5%).

**Exhibit 17**

The price is just too high on the Model 3, which is supposed to be their mass market product. Tesla is only shipping the ‚ÄòLong Range‚Äô Model 3 loaded with mandatory options: Not only are there very few $51,000+ compact sedans in the world (for good reason), reservations holders initially believed they were purchasing a $35,000 vehicle ($25,000 net of Federal and State tax credits) with $5,000 to $10,000 of potential options. The shift in pricing likely explains our estimated 11.5% conversion rate on Tesla‚Äôs 13,000 employee Model 3 reservations - these are primarily hourly workers, after all! Apparently sales in the Model 3 price range is just 1/6th of the sales in the 20k-30k. So much for mass market.

**Exhibit 18**

On the gross margin front, due to Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äòunique‚Äô accounting, we forecast gross margins of 15% to 20% for the Model 3 at average sales prices $46,500 per copy - but this will merely be an accounting mirage: If we apply traditional automaker accounting to our Model 3 forecasts - reducing the sales price by 10% to re-allocate SG&amp;A (19.41% at Tesla versus 7% for Ford and GM) as well as include expensed R&amp;D in COGS, the $46,500 Model 3 would generate gross margins of ‚Äì7.48%. The irony is that Tesla‚Äôs bull case (a mainstream car) is finally here, quite possibly bringing about their downfall (via massively flawed business model). The way this happens is by reducing the gross margin by the 10% discount that regular automakers give to dealerships, that save them SG&amp;A expenses, TSLA‚Äôs gross margins look nothing special. But when you realise that TSLA expenses R&amp;D costs that should be in in COGS in a separate line, since it‚Äôs development on current vehicles, the gross margins are actually much worse than the other companies.

"3/11/22 Weekly SPY AnalysisWell today was quite the exciting day if you ask me! 

After many saw that pre-market spike to 433.22 they thought we for sure had a green day secured in the bag. Only thing was the markets had something else planned that many did not expect and those who played the market as it lies were rewarded greatly! 

https://preview.redd.it/son0vjqcavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc65e2a536cdfa6da3ca839b3e377686f99c4d7

When I look at this chart I actually see the STRONGEST put signal from 0815am this morning all the way until right now as market is closing. The crazy thing that if you were to block all the white noise, all the Biden speech pumps, all the Russia bs, all the pumps and dumps intraday and you looked at this chart here. You would see that in almost 14 hours of trading there was only ONE 15 minute candle closed above the 8 ema. That is some hella bearish movement. You could have entered a put at market open and not touched it till end of day and easily made 100-200% gains on your puts. However, of course intraday we have so much going on we can not be so objective. 

Technical wise today had you just watch the 8 ema you would have been sitting pretty. But of course we have the classic sell off as Biden speaks followed by a big rally which we saw attempt to happen two times today. We also saw the VIX peak near 30.4 at 955am this morning and continue to fall as SPY continued to fall, which was interesting to watch. However, we saw around 240pm the VIX go on a massive fear run breaking its 8 ema and peaking at 31.04 before market closed. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zu6t15tdavm81.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9721c49c51293f43bc48b26eb1754aeb0aa99fe8

 if you follow me and were in the live chat today intraday around noon I mentioned SPY was testing its upward channel support and that if it broke the 424 support we would be breaking the channel and should see a big run down which can to happen exactly as I had mentioned. That‚Äôs why watching not only intraday but daily trends is so important.

 Which leaves us with this very nice looking bear channel that I also mentioned to keep an eye on. We have officially hit the upper resistance with that pre-market move to 433 and now naturally it makes sense to see it test the support line which puts SPY next week testing support levels between 400 and 410. If you remember last time SPY hit its new lower low of 410 it immediately sky rocketed back up‚Ä¶ we very well may see some of that same movement happen next week.

As mentioned this morning and intraday in the live what does this chart show you? Does it show you a bull chart or a massive bear chart? We are 100% without a doubt in a bear market. Even CNBC said we are super close to triggering their ‚Äúextreme bear market‚Äù indicator that hasn‚Äôt hit since 2008 I guess. 

Todays intraday movement and this daily candle finish was very important to me and very foretelling for what is going to happen next week. We have a bearish engulfing candle on the daily, we once again after breaking the daily 8 ema failed to close the candle above it. Looking at the EMAs the daily 8 and daily 20ema are damn near falling straight vertical down now we have such a bearish sentiment on the chart. The daily 50 ema closed in even closed to the daily 200 ema leaving only $3.5 left before the death cross happens‚Ä¶ We could see this death cross play out as early as Friday next week if we see some similar movement as this week and fail to make any significant upward movement. 

If you remember next week we have the oh so awaited first rate hike and FOMC meeting on Wednesday. It is going to be VERY interesting to see not only what JPOW has to say but what he chooses to do with the rate hike. Remember Thursday markets despite expected CPI did not like it and sold off still. I think next week we are going to see some fireworks on Wednesday and Thursday. IF I was a betting man its going to be the same thing as last week on Wednesday when JPOW testified we saw a fuck you green day followed by 4 very red days. 

10% challenge-

This was not my best week but overall a good week. I was attempting a few different strategies and pushing myself past my comfort zone and it did not pay off. I look forward to getting back to my tried and true method that works out well for me. But overall it was a good week. 

I made 15 trades and had 8 green and 7 red. 

Goal of the week is $2500/ week or $500/ day

I managed to net a profit of $1100 this week averaging a terrible 4% on the trades I made. 

Next week I need to get back on my game and back to the strategy that‚Äôs never failed me. No more pushing hard or making risk trades for no reason at all.

"7-18-22 Spy/ ES Futures and AMD Daily TASo let me get this straight‚Ä¶ we had nothing but terrible news all week last week but ole Apple drops a news nugget about hiring slowing and market capitulates itself? What the actual fuck is going on around here? But to be fair it makes sense‚Ä¶. It makes sense that they would do it on a random ass day instead of when we all expected it and were all positioned for it. 

Now the question is‚Ä¶. Was this a over reaction or was this the beginning of the next big leg down? My vote? I think we bounce tomorrow and maybe once tesla reports we actually go down‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs my opinion‚Ä¶ Ta wise it could go either way. 

https://preview.redd.it/fok0jak40ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e28e30b1eb997165164e0ebd3f9bcd3aca5ec195

If you look at SPY and ES futures weekly chart you can see we broke out upwards from the descending wedge which should be bullish, however, they both perfectly rejected their weekly 8ema. That rejection is actually more bearish than the resistance line break out. 

https://preview.redd.it/sprxl9q50ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=271a9db03de763e23746f08626cf09190fcb016f

Now the daily charts for SPY and Es futures look pretty bearish to me. On SPY we see we nearly perfectly tapped the downward tan channels resistance line and came just short of the sideways purple resistance line too. This tells me we have more to go down. If you look at the next chart below you can see we had a similar movement on April 21st and similar sized candle red on that day. We could be seeing the next big move of the market over the next month or so if this resistance rejection holds true. 

Looking at the ES futures you see that we broke the blue dotted resistance line which would be bullish but we rejected the purple channel. You can see by the blue arrows that everytime we have hit these we have reversed course. 

https://preview.redd.it/vn8d7kx60ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8da2c39629dce6d99bfccd78b654229ca5cd6583

And then we have the vix‚Ä¶ it attempted to break back into that key 25.5 level today and even saw 25.91 at its peak today but overall I would still venture to say that the VIX is not onboard yet for the next leg down. The only reason im not saying its time to go heavy into some puts here or uvxy/ VIX calls is because of how the VIX reacted today‚Ä¶ I feel like it more naturally reacted today but it still didn‚Äôt quite spike and hold like we would have expected. I would and will be bearish longer term once we break through 26.7 VIX. 

I still think this could have easily been a market over reaction to the Apple news. If it was a over reaction then we will see a pop tomorrow and most likely see a green day tomorrow. Unless some more news about tech come out tomorrow there really isn‚Äôt anything until Tesla earnings Wednesday night that would really move the markets. I would be careful here. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kjbg4z380ec91.png?width=380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4b31fa3f1c4cb7ce18bde07fec966420437a23c

I also would be careful until this breaks back under 20k. Hoping that a picture of it wont result in my post getting removed‚Ä¶ but I think this being so green today is a big hint of whats to come. I wont be full bear thill this breaks back under 20k and holds. 

Bull case for SPY/ ES-

Despite the big sell off today we managed to close at that key 382 support. It is an adjusted close to just slightly under 382.23 which is the daily 8ema‚Ä¶ Looking at Fridays candle we do see a possible double bottom forming here at 382 and the wicks at 380.6. The VIX has not fully committed to the next drop yet and until we really see that break and fly over 26.6 we most likely are going to hold what we got. We do have to keep in mind that today could have been a true market over reaction which we have seen time and time before. It could be argued that this new was used as a chance to fill the big gap up we had overnight and that now that the gap is filled we should reverse. 

Bear case for SPY/ ES- Markets have been looking for a reason to dump and this might finally be the reason. With a resistance line rejection of two key channels this morning with a failure to break through that is bearish. This morning even before the apple new markets had SPY pinned within a &lt;$2 range for almost the whole day till the sell off started. After blowing through key 385 support and now closing under the daily 8ema and 382 support it is only natural that we could see 378.8 to fill the gap below us. We also have a fully engulfing bear candle on the daily now

Daily support for SPY- 382 -&gt; 378.8 -&gt; 375.1 -&gt; 370.6

Daily support for ES- 3795 -&gt; 3744 -&gt; 3671

Daily resistance for SPY- 385 -&gt; 387.3 -&gt; 390.3

Daily resistance for ES- 3915 -&gt; 4020

I feel bearish long term still but short term im not ready to be bearish enough to hold anything. I would have like it better had we stopped at 385 and formed a doji at the top on all the dailys to help with a clear reversal. This fat massive candle is not quite the reversal candle we would expect. The case for both channel resistance rejection is quite strong but we haven‚Äôt had back to back trend days in a very long time and all last week no matter what happened buyers ate everything up and we even saw that today. 

Overall I see two scenarios

1) We will hold support here at 382 and back test resistance at 385. A rejection at 385 would be a more compelling top/ reversal case than we have here. I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the 388.5 resistance retested tomorrow either. If we see that then we can get not only a TRUE double top on the daily but we can also get a true tan channel resistance rejection. That would be a case for me to feel and stay feeling bearish. 

2) If we are seeing the next leg down it will start with filling the gap at 378.8. This is going to be key with what happens next. Most times a gap fills we do see a reversal so that is something we would need to keep in mind. However, if the VIX finally gets on board or we get anymore big tech bad news we might see this sell off continue. I would need VIX &gt;26.6 to believe in it though. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rih5eov90ec91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=947ffa2808f2d51357fea2154c30e4b50847a921

AMD actually looks fairly bearish here on the daily with this hanging man doji. This is the type of candle I wanted to see on ES or SPY today to really sell the top but we didn‚Äôt get it. AMD did fill their daily gap though so I would be surprised if we see a back test of support at 79.5. If that 79.5 support holds there is a pretty big case to be made for 87.2 still especially with the CHIP bill being voted on tomorrow. However, if 79.5 fails we just might see a back test of that 71.6 support. 

10% challenge-

Today was a GREAT day that I turned into a GOOD day thanks to greed and also playing it safe. All morning I hated the trend and I recognized the range super early which was great. The news broke out and I was able to get some nice plays in. I was not expecting this level of dump today and was definitely expecting this to be an over-reaction and recovery intraday especially since VIX wasn‚Äôt on board. Made some great gains and then at 2pm I made my error but going in on another 0dte OTM 381p. They burnt me with the choppiness and I finally decided to close for -41.7% after it bounced and bounce and bounced around. Little did I know had I just held on a little longer‚Ä¶ it woulda been a 6x position by EOD. 

Days like today are the hardest because its the time of day that if you just hold on long enough everything will be green. But days like today make the next day even harder. Because then we have this false safe feeling that ‚Äúwell if I just hold them imma get green.‚Äù And then we just keep holding and averaging down and it just keeps getting redder and redder until we realize we are too burn to even salvage anything. In this market we have to salvage our losses and mitigate our risk/ loss. 

Todays biggest lesson was 0dtes are still a great trade but EOD OTM 0dte are a big struggle. Had I just gone ATM like I usually do I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten burnt like that and felt the need to sell. I will not be playing these OTM again until days like FOMC when we fully expect the big move before it happens. 

Also had I just sat with my $1200 profits I would have been very happy but instead I ended up with just over $600 in profits. Tough day to trade today for sure.

"$TSLA prediction using Wyckoff Result vs Effort Model (AAPL reference)First off, I'm not a financial advisor, I am an absolute idiot. 

So, this isn't going to be the best DD in the world, but I think it offers a pretty significant correlation between the $AAPL Daily chart that is referenced in the Result vs Effort Model that Richard Wyckoff taught. 

https://preview.redd.it/44ri3xqfs9r81.png?width=1014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3baa5854b72f61080ea4cf5699b92a9666fd1ac6

What we are expecting here, is one last spike in volume on the decline, before a significant increase in value. I'm predicting it to get into the low 900's, maybe 800's again one last time before value incentive really kicks in to take this baby beyond the stratosphere. 

Not to mention, Elon is splitting the stock because it is currently over bought. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Wyckoff Price Cycle Visual](https://preview.redd.it/vt4js75ps9r81.png?width=1014&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a276aa9a7b62cb95c2d92d1ef24a5244344dfcbd)

The reason for Elon's stock split is to level out the growth of his company, creating more supply so the demand can continue to rise at a healthy rate. I believe this markdown (one more dip with a volume spike) will occur before the stock split in order to prepare $TSLA to be transferred into its new, healthier and more fruitful soil.

* Gapped down with slight upslope consolidation.
* It appears that SPY is lagging behind QQQ and IWM. Will SPY follow QQQ and IWM and see a break out of consolidation to the downside?

Levels

* Break 433.71 and look for 436.49 - 438.28
* Break 438.28 and look for 440.91
* Break 440.91 and look for 443.31 - 444.47 - 446.05
* Break 446.05 and look for 451.20 - 452.91
* Break 452.91 and look for 456.68 - 458.06
* Lose 428.69 and look for 425.71
* Lose 425.71 and look for 422.73 - 419.55 - 414.73

Notes:

* At this point I am bearish - neutral midterm. If we can close above 440 then I will be neutral mid-term.

* Double top on the 2 hr. RSI, from 2/28 to 3/2 is concerning. Level to watch on this time frame is 57.91. A break at this level will put us close to 444 IMO.

Was able to play a single call scalp on the bounce. I have yet another busy week beginning to stack up but it looks to clear up later in the week - thursday - friday so hopefully I can scalp most of those days.

"5-5-22 SPY, QQQ, VIX Daily TANote- I will no longer be Ta-ing Apple. I used to monitor it fairly heavily intraday but I have switched over to watching VOLD and VOLDSP intraday and its far more useful. I am also not seeing the level of correlation apple and SPY used to have to be useful to monitor. I will continue to monitor and TA QQQ as I do believe  those hold correlation especially with tech being so heavy in SPY. 

Look when I said yesterday that there was a triple top at 430 and I expected us to dip today this is not quite what I had in mind‚Ä¶ I mean I like being right but this was slightly overkill‚Ä¶ I also played my most successful overnight lotto but managed to close it beyond early. Close for an 80% gain which granted that‚Äôs some killer profits on an over night lotto‚Ä¶ end of day it was up at 500% before power hour. Does it hurt? Yea I mean a little but it hurts less then -100% so I got that going for me haha.

If you didn‚Äôt know there is a WIKI page with the large moves for SPY well we made Top 10 today and missed top 5 by 0.07%. 

Not gonna like the fact that SPY was down 3.8% but 1115am was beyond impressive and had broken -4% intraday before noon. This is one of the fastest and most aggressive intraday drops ive watched. I thought there COULD be a chance we get the circuit breaker today but that wasn‚Äôt in the paybook I guess‚Ä¶ for now. 

The thing that actually sucked the most about today was I went into the day bearish But in my head 420 was the max I thought we would drop. We had nearly blown through that before we even had the first candle of the day and then once we broke 418 I really was speechless. 

I always tell myself man I want a massive 4-5% day cause I know imma make bank but real talk the whole time you are in such disbelief that when you finally believe its already over. Especially today I mean it was so volatile and then one 11am came we pretty much traded flat all day with not a really big move to play. If you had an over night put and held you won. But for me I felt I kept playing against myself and pretty much just traded against myself winning one then losing one then winning one. Thankfully still netted 3x daily profits but not an ideal end to the day. 

So where the heck are we now? 

&amp;#x200B;

Triple Top confirmed‚Ä¶ lets puts 430 in as a MASSIVE resistance to break now. I am actually gonna enhance the line size and color it blue. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mznda9g2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0daadbded146272b5aab0b326f599178f41907d8

So we are obviously still well within the bear channel and now we are trading within the middle of the bear channel which means we could test resistance or we could test support again next. We have been slowly trading less bearish but this was a pretty big knock down. Currently support is at 405 √† 390-400 (bottom of support depending on how fast we move) and resistance is at 424 (top of bear channel). After we break 424 we have 430 to deal with. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pfs9z0sg2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ae65727e55811bebc27c6fc7c7831f541aaf55b

Here is the current daily with the three bear channels one longer term and the two shorter term. As I had mentioned yesterday we perfectly rejected off the 430 level for the resistance line and we had to gap down to maintain and boy did we. Now the question will be what do we do tomorrow? 

So we reached an intraday low of 409.44 today but 412.32 was pretty much a magnet for us all day today and was clearly support. Once we broke that we hit 410.1 for a bit before we recovered end of day to 413.81. What I am seeing is that 411.7 is a major support now over the last two months. If you look at the Feb 24th candle we close at 410.64 (within in reason of a daily support), April 29th the low was 411.21, May 2nds candle body sit on the 411.7 line, and then today we saw a ton of support in that 411-412 range. I think we are seeing a major support forming here at this 410-412 level on the daily. Even look at the May 2nd candle that did hit 405.02 we close above the 410-412 level and saw a large recoil that day. 

My theory is that‚Äôs our bottom for now. I think tomorrow we are going to see an inside range day which means we can trade anywhere between 425 and 410 tomorrow. 

Major support levels at 411.8 √† 405 √† 402 √† 395 (this is actually bottom of the broader bear channel we have been in since January) 

Major resistance- 417 √† 420 √† 424 √† 426 (current bear channels resistance line) √† 428

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a7zq0ybh2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f2033284968433b95652985519cbc30ed207358

I don‚Äôt usually reference the daily chart unless its Friday but I think its important enough to share here. We have had four week in a row of red candles on the weekly chart. We have not done that since the 2020 crash. 412.07 is the weeklys open and as long as this candle closes ABOVE that we will see a green candle to snap the trend. I have a feeling that we are going to finish about that level tomorrow. I don‚Äôt think they are gonna give us the red day. As you can also see we bounced this week off the weekly 100ema at 406 and off the support line of this grey weekly channel. 

You can also see the Feb 22nd  (wick) , April 25th and this week candles bodies are all sitting right on this 411 support range. I think this is our default support for now. 

I can see two maybe three scenarios for tomorrow

1. We are going to say fuck it all and drill straight to the core and have another -4% red day and touch 395 to confirm support of not only short term bear channel but broader bear channel too. 

2. We are going to see a massive rally back above 425 

3. We have a range day/ inside day like I mentioned. We could touch lower support of 405 but most likely would revert back up closer to 420 by EOD. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9imnsgzh2rx81.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=591a5c29270951b8cf61a836fb481e0e5a0aadae

Something I was playing with earlier was looking at the April 21st to April 26th dip before we finally recovered. It ws about 7.4% of movement down. If we are assuming a similar top was in at 430 we could see about the same range‚Ä¶ a roughly 7.4% move down would put us right at 400. Which is in range of tomorrow if we have another massive sell of. Just some food for thought.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uva5zs3j2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acb665e5139e8c6f52627559f443da641f346322

Notice anything similar about the QQQ chart compared to SPY? Let me show you a little closer‚Ä¶

Yes that‚Äôs right you are seeing a double bottom on QQQ at its support of 310. Actually wildly enough the double bottom is within 3 cents of each other (May 2nd 309.65 and todays low of 309.62). That‚Äôs a pretty convincing double bottom to me. 

QQQ traded perfectly within this channel today.

Major supports- 310 √† 301 (bottom of current red bear channel)

Major resistance- 318 √† 324 √† 327 (resistance line of bear channel)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wjo1op2k2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67937a450d7c9e82d00dc79179bfd50dc520000c

The VIX had a hella impressive day trading from its lows of 25.78 to its heights of 33.20. That‚Äôs a total 28.8% of movement upward today. The most impressive thing of it all is that when you look at the beginning of the day and pre market you NEVER would have suspected that. It just kept rising and refused to stop. IT was definitely interesting to watch unfold. Now the question is‚Ä¶ why? What caused it. Wildly enough‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt even top 10 biggest VIX spikes in one day‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1jotoqmk2rx81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d41e1c29fbfd19c9b56f9f48ba925637723d691f

Aight some of you are NOT gonna like this cause this is definitely TA-ing the VIX which I KNOW is a no-no‚Ä¶ trust me its impossible BUT there is a pattern. And when I see a pattern imma share it. 

So lets look back at the January/ February dip. We saw a massive spike to 39 √† dip to 26.9 √† another spike to 32.8 √† recovered to lows near 20. 

March dip.. we saw a massive spike to 37.8 √† relief down to 27 √† another spike to 37.5 √† unwound to 18.5

So our now April/ may dip‚Ä¶ we saw a massive spike to 36.6 √† relief down to 25 √† another massive spike to 33.2 √† will we see relief back down to low 20s?

My theory is yes we will. Now the timing on it is the tough one. The January peak day till it started to unwind was 5 days. March was 15 days. Currently we are at 4 with tomorrow being day 5. If you include the spike to 33.8 on April 26th we are at 8 days‚Ä¶ 

So while it MAY not happen tomorrow‚Ä¶ there is a pretty strong case in the next week to two weeks max we should start a bull run. One could argue that markets are waiting for CPI Wednesday before doing so. But there is potential we could start that unwinding now. But looking at this there is a case to suspect we see VIX revisit 35-40 and SPY touch that 390-400 level first. 

So really anything can happen tomorrow belief it or not‚Ä¶ How am I playing it? I am playing it bullish for tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Today was a good day I made 3x daily profits but I honestly felt like all I was doing all day was fighting myself. I erased just as much gains I had. Especially during that sideways window from 11 till power hour I kept fighting myself and not trusting myself. But im looking at just under 2x weekly profits this week going into tomorrow and I plan to have a good day trading tomorrow and be conservative to not erase any gains.

Here is my current positions I am carrying into tomorrow.

I decided to sell my cash secured puts near 425 this mornign when we LOOKED like we were bouncing before things really accelerated‚Ä¶ obviously you see about how that goes. I overall see limited downside tomorrow and next week so I will be rolling those tomorrow before market close, Overall not too worried about those. 

I closed out my 60dte put position this morning also (way too early)‚Ä¶ the plan with that was to load up as we bull ran for an anticiapted drop. Well now the plan is to load up 30dte calls for a potential bull run this month. 

I opened this at 425 and averaged down a few times today. I don‚Äôt plan to average down again until we touch 405. I fat fingered my DCA this morning and instead of buying about 3 controls I bought 6 so that was not ideal and now this is a much larger long position then I planned for but sitting here I am looking pretty good. My breakeven for these are 415.2 so I mean we are looking pretty golden especially if we see that move back to 430-440 next week or rest of month. 

I also decided to open a 418C lotto at close of day I was able to close that for 10%. So I then opened a new 415C lotto for tomorrow. I feel fairly confident whether it be in the morning or all day that those will print. 

And my hyperwheel. As you say my current puts I sold are very red but I will roll tomorrow for more premium and an expected bounce next week. I will choose not to get assigned this time.

"All the reasons SPY will see 455-460 before it sees 480+ againWelcome to my ted talk... cue the gay bear comments. 

Okay now retards listen up. 

Today we finally saw the dip we were looking for to confirm that SPY will (most likely) see a large dip before we reach ATH again.

Todays dip brought the price down to close at 468.38. Why is that important? Well throughout these dips this week the stock always managed to recover and close above the 5 day EMA and the 20 day EMA... until today. 

This closed the candle below the 20 day EMA of 470.4... historically looking back whenever SPY closed a candle below the 20 day it usually bounces near the 100 day EMA which is 455.2

The same applies to the daily bollinger bands. We had been bouncing off the mid bollinger and closing above it until today. We saw a close below the kid bollinger of 469.81... in general the price usually finds support near the lower bollinger band which is also near 457.15

Daily RSI is in a downward trend and the daily MACD is going to cross over to sell very soon. 

All of this brings me to the conclusion we will see 455 very soon... it should also be noted that there is a support line that perfectly runs along 455 which we saw SPY bounce off on 12/20/21, 10/6/21, 10/4/22, 10/30/2020, and 5/4/2020... yes this support line is almost a year and a half old. 

I am anticipating a sideways/ slight recovery and rest day tomorrow that should see a retest and rejection near that 20 day EMA before we close our 2nd candle below it.",0

"TSLA ER FAIL SBUX ER WIN tldr; blew some of my education fund on Tesla ER, made it back plus more on Starbucks ERSo recently I had some funds for the remainder of my degree wired into my checking account. I let my pops know I was going to manage some of it myself, essentially swing trade it or let it sit in something passive for weeks at a time. In true WSB style, I was mostly in $TVIX and $UGAZ then slingin' some FD's here and there. I took a decent sized hit on $V ER, opened the day down a considerable amount. I went to work with the two remaining day trades I had and got in some pre earnings $TSLA FDs finishing the day roughly even, I was happy with it. Then $TSLA ER happened, quick pop up to 268, no buyers and down she went, nearly 12%. Opened the next day down even lower, I wasn't gonna fold, but I was a little more tense at this point. I went big on $TSLA calls shortly after, doubled my losses on $TSLA and took a decent chunk out of my newly acquired funds. Spent most of the rest of the day kind of sulking and feeling sorry for myself until I was sitting at my desk..10 minutes to closing bell. I noticed $SBUX ER was at the end of the day, a name I was very familiar with, had been following it for weeks, played Q3 ER of 2018 and made a considerable amount then as well. I took the remainder of what I had in my account after being down more than a couple grand and all-inned $SBUX. I sat there for minutes after the bell, it actually even moved down about 1.5% before jumping more than $6, a huge beat. I made seven grand the next morning selling shortly after the opening bell. 

I felt compelled to share my degeneracy with you folks here because if this story inspired even one of you, it'd be worth the fifteen minutes I spent typing it. I'll try to attach proof and everything here, thanks for being a part of my first real post on reddit. Happy FD'ing. 

tldr; lost a chunk of my educational funds on $TSLA ER, came back in a big way on $SBUX ER. 

p.s. would love a flair

Similarly, although TSLA is the pioneer of EVs, competitors are catching up rapidly and will be able to produce vehicles as good as Tesla's in the next couple of years. When they do TSLA, will finally have the long-awaited crash that everyone has been predicting.

The only was I can see Elon getting himself out of this conundrum is if he can make TSLA the next AAPL. That has been his strategy so far, basically to make it a premium brand/luxury good that people will pay for disregarding the cost. It remains to be seen whether he can pull this off.

But if the market starts getting fractured and Tesla can't maintain its dominance, the stock price will crash dramatically just like Netflix did.

"DD $GOEV / Canoo's potential AAPL Partnership with a side of short squeeze üöÄFirst I want to congratulate us on breaking 8 million degenerates. I have been posting on this sub for over 3 years back when we were at only a couple hundred thousand. This is my first DD write up and I‚Äôm a little retarded so please go easy on me. 

For everyone who doesn‚Äôt want to read a wall of text there‚Äôs a **TL:DR** at the bottom.

**Technical Setup:**

Canoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capital‚Äôs retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you haven‚Äôt been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out. 

[S3 short Info](https://imgur.com/RPVpzbu)

[NASDAQ Short Info](https://imgur.com/LrjJJCD)

[Share Borrow &amp; Fees](https://imgur.com/esZFBfL)

**Fundamental Setup:**

GOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.

[MPDV Purpose Built Vehicle](https://www.canoo.com/mpdv/) 

Canoo‚Äôs leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 &amp; i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. 

The real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that‚Äôs not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car‚Ä¶ the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to connect these dots.

"It's time to Short Squeeze SpyEdit: I was told this lacked rockets. Here are some rockets for your upvote:

SPY üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Perhaps you have heard, but the new thing is to short squeeze everything. There is no other type of DD, just short squeeze DD.

DD actually does not mean due diligence, it‚Äôs actually an Akkadian term that Hammurabi came up with in ancient Babylon when he minted the first stock certificate in 1760 BC on a stone tablet, and his younger sister Iltani then tried to borrow it and sell it, and then he asked her to return it immediately, and she had to pay more than she sold it for to get it back. In other words, DD means short squeeze and short squeeze means DD.

But I‚Äôm now way off topic.

**It is of course simple to do a short squeeze, and SPY is the thing that is not yet squoze.**

First you find a thing people know, so it has meme potential and you don‚Äôt have to build brand recognition. This is actually more important than if anyone has shorted it.

Then you declare a ‚Äòshort squeeze‚Äô is possible. Again, it doesn't matter how much it's been shorted.

Lastly‚Ä¶ You ‚Äòshort squeeze‚Äô (*By buying tons of call options, which is actually a delta squeeze and then a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze SHHHHH*).

Why do I bring this up? I‚Äôm glad you asked. It's like I said, it's time to short squeeze SPY.

You may be thinking‚Ä¶ what could be more idiotic? Is there a faster way to lose money? The answers are of course ‚Äònothing‚Äô and ‚Äòno‚Äô.

**But those thoughts don‚Äôt serve up confirmatory bias. So instead, here‚Äôs a list of things that may help you with confirmatory bias:**

1. Tendies
2. It‚Äôs actually the SPDR, or Spider, S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust. Spiders are vicious ambush predators, the type that would trap and feast upon the tendies of a hedge fund manager if they could.
3. Citadel Securities, Melvin Capital, and ‚ÄúThe Hedge Funds‚Äù have surely shorted this at some point, and I hear they aren‚Äôt so popular around here.
4. The short interest is 16%. That may not sound like a lot, but if 21% was good enough for AMC, surely 16% is close enough. More importantly, that is 362 BILLION DOLLARS of shares short. Even at its highest points, GME had something like 15 or 20 billion dollars short and the shorts had no choice but to cover. Even Stevie Cohen and Citadel can‚Äôt bail a bunch of hedge funds out of 362 billion dollars in an epic short squeeze of SPY! It would take a fed intervention, and they never do stuff like that.

But it gets even better! S&amp;P 500 futures trade in arbitrage (fancy word for ‚Äòsame way) against SPY, and there are currently bout 2.8 million of those outstanding. Each one is $210k, so this is another $588 billion dollars of exposure‚Ä¶ and because each one technically has a long end and a short counterparty, it is in a way 100% short. Wow!

Of course, none of this would be any good with a visual aid, since a lot of people here can‚Äôt read. Here‚Äôs a graph from the latest SpotGamma newsletter that shows the positioning of gamma vs SPY and SPX prices. They sadly don‚Äôt have ES. This suggests that squeezing up will be resisted by options at first and that squeezing SPY is unlikely to work, but don‚Äôt worry, the hedge funds would never see it coming if that call interest above suddenly became long calls!

**Risks:**

Aside from the fact that this is an incredibly stupid idea that you should not try to do under any circumstances, I am aware of a few risks:

1. The hedgies will play dirty and do what is called a ‚Äòshort ladder‚Äô attack. This consists of them going to home depot, buying a foot ladder, and swinging it in a low motion at your shins. It also makes your stock prices go down. I recommend buying cowboy boots to defend against this.
2. The hedgies also can do 'naked shorting'. This is when they take off their clothes and dump ES futures, which just require a counterparty on the other end, and don't require you have the stock to sell, just that you post collateral.
3. You guys will get distracted by a struggling retailer or mattress company or purveyor of lethal intelligence or something.

Positions: I‚Äôll buy some SPY calls tomorrow in solidarity and because I like to be excited about the stock market over the weekend. I currently have stonks that in aggregate make me effectively long SPY.

"Weekly Risk Ranges for TSLA, AAPL, SPY, QQQ, IWM, GOOG, MSFT, AMD, AMZNIf this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news. Lastly, keep in mind that you don't want to do this with low volume stocks because the difference between the bid and ask can be wide.",0

My thoughts are that we were told 50 bps next 3 meetings... jpow VERY rarely does anything he doesnt say he would do... IF he changes his tune here he knows markets are gonna tank. he has to be tactful... so he will do something like CPI is peaking and slowing... we are doing xyz blah blah blah if we do 75 to 100bps hike right now we are going to wreck xyz so we are still going to do 50bps hike like we planned. Come August meeting if we see inflation has not peaked as anticipated we will go ahead and do a 100bps hike...   
 

Plus JPOW now has an arguably good PPI that beat expectations to use in his favor.

if we do 50bps hike markets rally.

if we do 75bps hike we rally (priced in).

if we do 100bps we die.  
 

Though I expected some sort of small rally today into FOMC and VIX to unwind so at this point really anything is possible. However, what JPOW says will be very important tomorrow and will guide the market for the next month or so in my opinion. 

https://preview.redd.it/ct00en0ttn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8cb8f680e1802d66dc0000c14b8c26f6c9f921c8

It was a fairly untradeable and frustrating day today where there was no momentum and no continuation. Overall we saw SPY make 14 total reversals intraday today. The biggest of them was the opening hour. We saw an immediate sell off followed by a near 10mil volume 15min candle that was arguably trying to breakout only for a ¬º volume candle to come in and take us back to drill down. After that first 45minutes of movement we just saw sideways burn and failed breakout after breakout. 373 support looked extremely strong all day until PH when we broke through it only to see a fairly impressive rally EOD. Bulls really tried their EOD but failed to close SPY green. A very frustrating and untradeable day. 

https://preview.redd.it/27s7mb0utn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d95986965d5ba89e1794343d602a3a3bbbdfbff

The daily does show that we are attempting to hold 373.5 as support now. It was encouraging not seeing a massively red day today also. 

https://preview.redd.it/tzoz8shvtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2242c634c6473212631bae0df9e0b48ab979fdb

The weekly bounced right at support today. IF we get a bad FOMC tomorrow and we drill we are going to be looking at not only a massive weekly gap but we are going to break fairly large support and be looking to bounce off the weekly 200ema at 363. 

https://preview.redd.it/5lqvw56wtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea9213e2509ea1a1665489ab13b02071bc48ff4a

The VIX was a big part of the frustration today in that it just didn‚Äôt wanna find a trend. Overall until EOD it was unwinding but once she hit that 32.1 level it rejected fairly hard and bounced causing that EOD sell off. The VIX really needs to get under 32 and look for the 20s again for the bulls to have any hope.

With FOMC tomorrow there is bound to be a lot of fuckery. Most likely we will see the morning chose a trend from 930am till about 1030am and trade sideways till about 1230pm or so when we will see it inverse itself and trend closer to opening price. 

2pm is when the FOMC rate hike is released. We should see a fairly significant move with that. 

https://preview.redd.it/f175tlywtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e544028dd690f3bd3b3dbf409b59b06c1e61217

  
 This was last FOMC as you can see at 2pm with the rate hike we were fairly indecisive forming a 15minute doji‚Ä¶ JPOW started talking at 230pm. Markets found their bottom and from their rallied until close. (this way May 4th FOMC).

https://preview.redd.it/y06ylenxtn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63dedce4c59778d289322a41c9f0801be1e7b87b

March 16th same thing‚Ä¶ we saw markets at 2pm react to the FOMC rate hike and by 230 when JPOW started talking we were finding bottom and at 245pm we were in the trend we were going to continue in and rallied till close. 

https://preview.redd.it/rz9affmytn591.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b895ce71a9e491d3dbf1757ec89cdba9a91aa6e2

  
 Now for January we didn‚Äôt have a rate hike but I believe ole JPOW finally got scared about inflation here and scared the markets‚Ä¶ so at 2pm when FOMC was released we saw the doji (like may 4th) and then when he started his presser at 230pm we started our downward trend by 245 we were confirmed. However this trend peaked at 3pm and then slightly recovered. I don‚Äôt really equate this January one to much since there is no expected rate hike so we really mainly should focus on May and March. 

2pm- March 16th( -1.01%)  May 4th ( +/- 0.5% both ways‚Ä¶ up first then down)

215pm- March 16th (+0.5%) May 4th (down 0.3% then up +0.8%)

230pm- March 16th (dropped 0.3% and then rallied 1.2%) May 4th (down 1.1% then up +1.5%)

245pm- March 16th (+0.5%) May 4th (+1.2%)

3pm to 4pm- March 16th (+1.32%) May 4th (1.4%)

March 16th- from 2pm open price dropped a total of 1.5% in 30 minutes then rallied 2.5% from 230pm low till 4pm close.

May 4th- from 2pm open price dropped a total of 1% in 30 minutes then rallied 3.61% from the 230pm low till 4pm close.

So how do we play tomorrow? Well I would be looking for about a 1% drop from the 2pm candles opening price so say we open the 2pm candle tomorrow at 375 look for 371.25 as a 230pm bottom. From there you can expect about a 2.5% to 3.6% green rally. 

So you could either open a straddle with 0dte and about 3-5OTM strikes (do this at like 155pm) set the take profits on both to 30-50% and i would be shocked not to see both of them fill. Or you could open both and set 100% take profits on both and play it that way. One of them is almost guaranteed to hit 100% and then the other will be free. Most FOMC meetings you can easily turn 50-100% profits a few different times. 

Another way to play it and probably the better way to play it is to wait till about 230pm for a bottom (or top I guess) and buy an option then. Most likely after 230pm we will see a great move one way or another. I would look for the VIX as a guide for this too if VIX is rocketing and you are thinking calls you are wrong‚Ä¶ but if VIX is unwinding and you are thinking calls then you are right. By 245pm we should have a fairly clear direction and you should be safer to enter a play. 

For me I will be waying my options of a 30% take profit straddle placed at 159pm and then I will look for a play at the bottom near 230 to grab a fairly OTM option on to ride till at least 3pm. 

10% challenge- 

Overall a fairly frustrating day. I took some calls at 10am when we looked to breaking out and everything look fairly bullish. But of course those got wrecked pretty quickly. I had planned to hold those till tomorrow thinking we would see the big green rally but once we lose 373 EOD I knew my hopes of seeing a green close for those were low and I took the L. I played a few scalps last 45minutes that all pretty much washed eachother out. Looking forward to tomorrow and FOMC being over and hopefully we get some clearer trend and momentum days. Overall there was just zero follow through today and by time momentum was confirming a trade it was reversing already. These sideways VIX days are brutal. 

Today was a good day of patience and recognizing when the setups aren‚Äôt working in your favor. Sitting cash sometimes is the hardest thing we do and not FOMOing into every play.

"PLTR used to bust NFLX insider traders.WSJ recently published an article detailing the SEC‚Äôs bust of three current and former Netflix engineers for insider trading.

The cool part is that PLTR was used to detect the suspicious trades. From the article:

With the meeting vote having been the last obstacle before the company could move forward, the schedule that the e-commerce platform provider adopted was relatively quick.

A couple of key dates are coming up. The record date for the stock split will be Wednesday, June 22, which is officially the day on which investors have to be shareholders of record in order to receive the additional shares.

The important date for investors is the payment date, which is when the additional shares from the split will go to investors. That will happen after the market closes on Tuesday, June 28. When trading starts the following day on Wednesday, June 29, Shopify stock will trade at post-split levels of roughly one-tenth their pre-split price.

"SPY- Another day another bullish channel brokenWell if you followed my post yesterday youd have played puts once we broke 455 and made some $$$$ today. 

Overall today was a heck of a bearish indicator. Nasdaq and spy couldn't be telling us any more clearly that we will be seeing a correction of 10%- 15% roughly. 

Spy broke another support today at 455.5 and not only that but it closes below the 100 ema all the way down near 451.8. 
https://imgur.com/a/O3fWIPd
https://i.imgur.com/6K8TnxD.jpeg

On top of that nasdaq officially entered 10%+ correction territory. Nasdaq broke a major support today and will in my opinion see a dip to 14000. Which would give it roughly a 14% correction. 

With spy confirming the close below the 100 ema we should see a dip to the 200 ema near 438. A dip here gives is about a 9% total correction. 

I believe once we reach these levels we will be able to see a full recovery and return of the bull run. For those of you who think stonks only go up... maybe go find a hobby for a little bit lol. 

Heres what i will be watching going into end of week. 

Today and right now Biden is speaking on covid. Hes inferring no more lockdowns or school closings and of course pushing his build back better agenda. Markets could see this as a positive and react that way tomorrow. I dont think we see a full on recovery just from that though. 

https://i.imgur.com/kXtNyoG.jpeg
Intraday we are in a downward channel and saw a bounce off support near 451.4 at close. I suspect we see a recovery bounce towards resistance at 457. 

Resistance levels to watch intraday- 453 --&gt; 455 --&gt; 457. If we can break 457 we could see a bigger recovery run towards 469. 

Longer term resistance of 469 is the major resistance that needs to be broken in order to confirm the bear trends broken. Another note on the daily is that the 5 ema has formed a downward resistance line also at 460 that needs to be broken. 

Support levels intraday is that 451.4... if we break this truthfully there really isnt much support till 440. 

Today for me was a nice day for me. $2400 gain day for me (not pictured is a call and 2 puts i closed). 
https://i.imgur.com/IEMIjMD.jpeg 


How im playing the rest of the week. 

Tomorrow im expecting a bounce to 457 resistance and that we will get rejected. Imma go in on some 456P 7-14 DTE once we get rejected at 457. IF we break 457 ill ride a small call position up. Im not sure where we would get rejected. Likely stop at the daily 50 ema 464. However, overall a close below the 100 ema on the daily should indicate a dip to the 200 ema near 438. Ill also be watching the nasdaq too to see how it moves tomorrow.",0

"Time to Buy a Real Stock : AMD (Kill The Shorts Part 2)I know we‚Äôve had our fun with GME and I‚Äôm sure it still has a shot to go up. However, let me re-introduce you to a real stock: **AMD**. üöÄüöÄ

At $88 a share, we‚Äôre looking at massive upside. And instead of buying GME at $83, why not buy something that actually has some long term value? Oh and did I mention it‚Äôs one of the most shorted stocks this month? [https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/most-shorted-stocks)

**That‚Äôs $6.7 billion in short interest.** That‚Äôs larger than the actual current market cap of GME. Let‚Äôs actually make a dent here. These fuckers **added 17% more shorted shares** in the last month. You're gonna tell me their diamond hands are better than OUR DIAMOND HANDS üíéüíéüíé?

As our savior Elon Tweeted today : ‚ÄúI am become meme, destroyer of shorts.‚Äù

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357269755112148993)

Let‚Äôs make him proud.

Ok, now for some DD so you guys know I‚Äôm not talking out of my ass.

# Fundamentals:

Their latest ER:

**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**

**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**

Server revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible because that means they are actually going toe to toe with the big boys like IBM.

Massive increase in guidance. They‚Äôre **expecting 37% growth** this year.

So why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let‚Äôs be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.

Obviously, we‚Äôd prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you‚Äôre gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, ‚Äúhey we have too many orders and we can‚Äôt keep up sorry, we‚Äôll get it to you ASAP‚Äù

Imagine thinking this company isn‚Äôt going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.

Our queen, Lisa Su, said ‚Äúthere will be added capacity‚Äù in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they‚Äôll be good to go. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.

**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**

Intel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!

**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.

**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.

# Technicals:

For those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.

We really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we‚Äôre basically there right now.

In addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**

For more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.

# Conclusion/TLDR:

My point is that more than half of you fuckers run AMD in your machine anyway and the other half is waiting for their stimulus check to buy the new Ryzen series. The new investors here are all sad from GME, but now it‚Äôs time to put your big boy pants on and get into something that has some real value behind it. You got questions? Leave em in the comments and I‚Äôll answer.

[Tesla Q1 2019 Vehicle Production &amp; Deliveries | April 03 2019](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q1-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries)

**First quarter 2019 highlights**

* Produced 77,100 total vehicles, +123% YoY
* Approximately 63,000 vehicle deliveries, +110% YoY.
* Automotive gross margin excluding SBC and ZEV credit ‚Äì non-GAAP 20.3%, +149 basis points YoY.
* Capital expenditures $279,932,000, -57% YoY.
* Operating cash flow less capital expenditures ($919,538,000), -13% YoY.

**2019 outlook**

* Deliver between 90,000 and 100,000 vehicles in Q2.
* Reaffirm guidance of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries in 2019.
* May be able to produce as many as 500,000 vehicles globally in 2019.
* Being able to produce over 500,000 vehicles globally in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2020 does appear very likely.
* Target a 25% non-GAAP gross margin on Model S, Model X and Model 3.
* Energy generation and storage revenue should increase significantly in 2019.
* 2019 capital expenditure is expected to be about $2.0 to $2.5 billion.

**Fourth quarter &amp; full year 2018 highlights**

* Q4 deliveries grew to 90,700 vehicles, +203% YoY.
* Delivered a total of 245,240 vehicles, +142% YoY
* Delivered almost as many vehicles in 2018 as delivered in all prior years combined.
* Production in Q4 grew to 86,555 vehicles, +252% YoY.
* Q4 2GC018 automotive gross margin excluding SBC and ZEV credit-non-GAAP 24.7%, +1086 basis points YoY.

* Targeting annualized Model 3 output in excess of 500,000 units sometime between Q4 of 2019 and Q2 of 2020.
* Deliveries in North America during Q1 will be lower than the prior quarter as we start delivering cars in Europe and China for the first time. As a result of the start of Model 3 expansion into Europe and China, deliveries will be lower than production by about 10,000 units due to vehicle transit times to these markets.

* Operating expenses will grow by less than 10% in 2019, thus creating massive leverage given the top line growth in 2019.
* Restructuring actions taken in Q1 will reduce our costs by about $400 million annually.
* Q1 financials will reflect a one-time restructuring cost.
* The gap between production and deliveries in Q1 will create a temporary but predictable dip in our revenues and earnings.
* Target is to achieve a very small GAAP net income in Q1.
* The higher in-transit inventory will also negatively impact operating cash flows in Q1.
* Deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019.
* Capital expenditure is expected to be about $2.5 billion.

[Tesla adjusts Autopilot to comply with new EU regulations | May 17 2019](https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/17/tesla-updates-autopilot-europe/)

Tesla will push an updated Autopilot in Europe that scales back on a couple of functions in order to comply with new regulations. The changes will require faster lane changes and limit how far you can turn the steering wheel on Autosteer. Electrek reports that while Tesla's Autopilot was approved under older rules, it had to be dialed back in order to comply with the new UN/ECE R79 regulation on driver assistance systems. The update only impacts Model S and Model X vehicles; Model 3 already complies with the new rules.

Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk is turning to the insurance business in an attempt to achieve what the automaker has so far struggled with on the vehicle pricing front: lower costs for customers. Tesla says it will start offering insurance this month that taps internal data from the AutoPilot driver-assist system to reduce rates. Musk, on Tesla's first-quarter earnings call, said the product would ""be much more compelling than anything else out there.""

[More Advanced Safety for Tesla Owners | May 2, 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/more-advanced-safety-tesla-owners)

The massive amount of real-world data gathered from our cars‚Äô eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar, coupled with billions of miles of inputs from real drivers, helps us better understand the patterns to watch out for in the moments before a crash. As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That‚Äôs because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we‚Äôre introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features ‚Äì Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance ‚Äì help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.

The chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a ‚Äúhalf-trillion dollar market cap company,‚Äù said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn‚Äôt open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.

[Tesla delays electric semi truck production to next year | Apr 25th 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/04/25/tesla-semi-delay-electric-truck-production-next-year/)

During its first quarter 2019 earnings call last night, Tesla confirmed that it is delaying the production of Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck program, to next year. The executive also said that they are currently testing the electric trucks with maximum loads and that they are making improvements to the design. Musk previously said that Tesla aims to manufacture 100,000 electric trucks per year. Over the past two years, Tesla has been taking reservations for the electric truck and said that the production versions will have 300-mile and 500-mile range versions for $150,000 and $180,000 respectively.

Using the same 100 kWh battery pack, these design and architecture updates will allow drivers to travel farther than ever before, charging less frequently and getting more range out of every dollar spent on charging. We‚Äôre also introducing a brand-new adaptive suspension system for Model S and Model X, along with a few other improvements for the best range, acceleration, and ride comfort ever, plus a Ludicrous Mode upgrade for our most loyal customers.

Tesla vehicles will likely be better at driving than humans by the end of 2019, CEO Elon Musk said in an interview with MIT research scientist Lex Fridman.

Of course, we need some context here to explain what Musk is referring to, so here's the tweets:@RamLover69 You would still be physically fatigued if you tried to haul 12,000 lbs of steel beams like I do every day with my Dodge Ram, 2019s motor trend truck of the year.@elonmusk 12,000 lbs!?

As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with ""crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard,"" noted Musk in a previous tweet. We suspect that whatever a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150 can do, Tesla will one-up those figures.

Elon Musk isn‚Äôt giving up on bringing Tesla Inc. to India. ‚ÄúWould love to be there this year.

The specs weren‚Äôt much of a surprise either: the long-range Model Y has a range of 300 miles and seating for seven. A performance version of the vehicle is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. ‚ÄúIt has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,‚Äù Musk said. ‚ÄúSo this thing will be really tight on corners.‚Äù The $47,000 long-range Model Y will come first in the fall of 2020, and it will have a range of 300 miles, Musk said. Tesla will also sell an all-wheel drive dual-motor version for $51,000 and a performance version for $60,000 ‚Äî both of which will be available in fall 2020. The cheaper, standard range version with a range of 230 miles won‚Äôt be available until 2021, Musk said. It will sell for $39,000.

[Introducing V3 Supercharging | March 6 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)

Tesla has more than 12,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia and our network continues to grow daily: more than 99% of the U.S. population is covered by the network, and we anticipate similar coverage in Europe by the end of 2019. Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we‚Äôre announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.

The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.

[Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)

According to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017‚Äî and that doesn‚Äôt even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it‚Äôs left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a ‚ÄúStandby‚Äù state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car‚Äôs external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an ‚ÄúAlert‚Äù state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an ‚ÄúAlarm‚Äù state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car‚Äôs audio system. If a car switches to ‚ÄúAlarm‚Äù state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They‚Äôll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.

After earning bachelor's degrees in physics and business from the University of Pennsylvania, he worked briefly on ultracapacitors at Pinnacle Research in Silicon Valley to understand their potential as an energy storage mechanism for EVs. He planned to do graduate studies at Stanford in materials science and applied physics but put school on hold to start Internet companies Zip2 and PayPal. In addition to his Tesla duties, he leads SpaceX,where he oversees the development and manufacturing of advanced rockets and spacecraft for missions to and beyond Earth orbit.

At Tesla, JB focuses on technical direction and engineering design including battery technology, power electronics, motors, software, firmware and controls. In addition to his work at Tesla, JB is also a lecturer at his alma mater, Stanford University, where he created and teaches an engineering class and lab focused on energy storage integration (CEE 176C) in the Engineering Department. JB has had a lifelong interest in electric vehicles, including rebuilding an electric gold cart at the age of 14, building an Electric Porsche 944 that held a world EV racing record, solar car racing and building a hybrid trailer system that he designed while in college. In 2008 the MIT Technology Review chose JB as ‚Äú#1 Innovator of 35 under 35 for the year‚Äù. In 2009 DesignNews named him ‚ÄúEngineer of the Year‚Äù. And in 2015 he was listed as #2 on Fortune‚Äôs 40 under 40 most influential business and innovation leaders.

$SPY trade OpportunityIm sure you all see people making big gains with spy and wonder how tf can i make similar gains?

* Stocks reached a new high as strong corporate earnings overshadowed disappointing manufacturing data.
* Treasuries dropped.
* The S&amp;P 500 recovered from earlier losses, with gains led by energy and consumer discretionary companies. For the first time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 36,000 mark. A small-cap index rose 2.7%. A group of retail-trader favorites, including Gamestop and AMC Entertainment holdings had their best day since August.
* More than 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies reporting third-quarter results outperformed Wall Street expectations. Since the start of the earnings season, this has laid the groundwork for a stock market rally.
* Meanwhile, data showed that manufacturers faced persistent supply-chain challenges in October. Fed officials will meet this week as investors worry that the economy is facing the most widespread supply crunch since the 1973 oil crisis.
* According to Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson, the bullish trend in equities may continue into the Thanksgiving holiday later this month, but ""not for much longer,"" as the Fed is expected to begin tapering and earnings growth will slow further into next year.

"Chart Voodoo and Dark Rituals - LULU &amp; NVDAI'm back with another installment of sinister magic. This week I learned a little bit about farming and the income I could make from it. One word: Ostriches. Raising these bad boys is super profitable. Eggs, leather, meat... Sell it all, just like the natives of old. So I asked my uncle if I could buy a few and raise them on his farm. We're in business. From here on out it's ostrich blood, boys. I broke out the old ouija board and drew some charts. You all know the process by now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to admit I conjured up this chart voodoo last week, but it's turned out pretty well. We got LULU and NVDA on spotlight. I like these bad boys because they are meme stocks and have high growth potential. If you get into these trades now, you won't see max profit potential, but I still predict continuation of these trends.

&amp;#x200B;

LULU broke out from a bull flag and is fast on its way to $192. The lines indicate $181 would have been a good entry point, $179 as stop loss and $192 as target.

I got bad news for you all. NVDA is going south for a while. NVDA failed its breakout from an ascending triangle in March and is now forming a bearish flag pattern. The lines indicate that a good entry was $162, stop loss at $168, and a target of $140 (aggressive, I know).

   * Tread carefully with 0dte calls tomorrow as bearish divergences are showing on multiple indicators and algos have diverged. The rising wedge does favor the bears but doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt fail. Be üíß.

Rising wedge - Bullish bias üéØ 451.96 - 453.95 (be mindful of a false break at 450.58). Bearish bias üéØ 446.08 - 444.07 (needs to break 448.08). This pattern usually favors the bears. We shall see.

"9-26-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple And Tesla Daily Market AnalysisWhat a way to start the week off! Lets set the scene here‚Ä¶ 

The last time we had 5 red days in a row was July 8th to July 14th where SPY dropped from 390.64 to 371.04. The 6th day was a huge 1.91% green day. Before that was the June CPI/ FOMC drop where we put 5 red days in a row with a drop from 415.82 to 370.59. There was one green day (fomc) of 1.43% then we had 2 more red days down to 362.17. From there we saw a bigger pop of 3 of 4 days being green and going from 362.17 to 390.09. There has not been an instance of 6 red days in a row on SPY since Feb 2020. 

We have to ask ourselves are we in the same level of turmoil as Feb 2020? I would say no we are not. But we are clearly in a pretty bearish period of time in the markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9t02og5dj9q91.png?width=844&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f32fa0e1647668cf9ebcc2fa89479db2e6f2ecf

Got a lot going on the daily chart but let me explain. I had mentioned the similarities for June 8th to June 17th on the SPY chart and this daily candle close today just made it even more similar. On June 16th we put in a candle of 370.94 to 364.08 followed be a 369.38 to 362.17 candle (that would be two back to back candles with a slightly lower high and a slightly lower low). Friday was 370.62 to 363.29 and today was 370.21 to 363.03‚Ä¶ the exact same thing.

This to me could be a very large double bottom forming on SPY. Now only that but that June 17th low as I mentioned came after a 7 out of 8 red day stretch and SPY currently just put in its 8th red day out of the last 10 trading days. If spy is going to bounce its here‚Ä¶ and if its not going to bounce the massive face melting dump is about to begin‚Ä¶ Failure for SPY to make a new low for the year twice now sends a pretty big message especially with these large EOD intraday v bottoms we are seeing. Todays price action brought spy to the 75% retracement of the 2022 bear channel also. 

My anticipation here after 5 red days in a row is that we are going to see a large green day tomorrow and most likely will close over 370.6 resistance. From there I would anticipate a move back to 380-390 by end of week much like we saw at the June low. 

Key support- 362.2 -&gt;358.1 

Key resistance- 366.5 -&gt; 370.6

Futures is looking to close it lowest candle of the year currently. Currently the lowest close was on June 16that 3671.25.

Key support- 3630

Key resistance- 3672 -&gt; 3708

&amp;#x200B;

There is a pretty enormous inverse head and shoulders forming on apple daily and weekly with a current support of 149.2. Apple and overall tech today held up much better then SPY. What I am seeing which is the same as last week is that this is not a NASDAQ driven sell off. I tend to be bullish on Apple as long as it holds 149.2.

Key support- 149.2 -&gt; 147.1 

Key resistance- 151.1 -&gt; 152.4 -&gt; 154.5

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nwx1iz6fj9q91.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6cc412f9f4d38e30a34bb11f05cb2fda8e3fef9

Quite a bit to unpack here on the Tesla daily. I mentioned last week I forsaw after the 312 rejection a possible head and shoulders forming with a target of 222-250 (blue arrows for visual). However, looking at the smaller red arrows we actually are forming a possible bullish 270.3 support bounce with a possible target of retesting that 312 level again. 

If tesla closes below 270.3 on the daily chart then I would look for the bigger sell off to play out. However, as long as we are holding support here at 270.3 there is a play on calls to 300-312.

Key support- 270.3 -&gt; 251.2

Key resistance- 283.7 -&gt; 291.6

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x2xaznofj9q91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0be12b8322a23aecc1808ee37f29b8400c2275ff

The VIX was again on a pretty big mission today and saw a ton of intraday volatility. The one thing I am seeing here is that the VIX still has not broken that black dotted resistance line from the Jan 24 and May 2nd highs‚Ä¶ Until that line is broken and until we see SPY break 362.17 (low of year) I am under the impression we hold support here. The VIX really has struggled to stay over 32 barely closing over it today. If the VIX breaks over 33.1 tomorrow and especially over 33.7 tomorrow I would be looking for a bigger sell off on SPY to take place. However, we may see the vix unwind and close back under 29.7 tomorrow which further points to a bigger green day tomorrow. 

10% challenge-

Overall had a really great day today and the server as a whole had a great day! The opening hour continues to be a great trading time and the middle of the day is harder to get a good read on technical.

I am holding these calls. I had opened them at market open today. If my thesis holds true these will be itm tomorrow and green. I would like to close them tomorrow if possible but would consider holding till Wednesday if it looks like we are pushing. My first target for selling is the 373.44 gap fill (2.5% from close). If we make a new year low I will close these at a loss.

Overall pretty great day today despite the big morning reversal and high volatility. 

Remember when the VIX is over 30 (aka high volatility) we should be risk off here‚Ä¶ we should be less greedy and should be careful of rogue moves up or down. Protect profits, preserve capital and live to trade another day.

"RIVN &lt; TSLA?(NASDAQ: RIVN &lt; TSLA?)

Let me explain by clarifying, I am very new to investing I only have about 6 months of experience with Etherium. So take everything I say as a suggestion, not fact with that being said; here is my Idea:

As we all know now, the combustion engine is slated to be killed, with some companies even stopping production as early as 2025. So suggesting an EV manufacturing company is going to take off isn't a hard thing to believe. What I myself do believe is that Rivian at the moment is falling into obscurity, with a net income of -1.7B, and a 52wk low of just $18.

If together we let this fall, to its low which by the look of things it's going to do. You could buy it dirt cheap.

But why, how could a failing EV company grow with subpar vehicles, especially in a growing competitive market?; well Rivian has partnered with Mercedes Benz to bring the first luxury Suv EV to the market. I think that this EV will take off rocketing Rivian to the top with, an ungodly amount of buy-ins.

Once again very new to this, and do not have a degree by any means this is just a hunch I have and with the help of this sub I think we could turn this stock into the next GME, let me know what you think (Might be the dumbest shit ever, might be the best buy ever we will see eh?.

"SPY may reach $500 by end of this yearEven if this week was a bull trap and SPY goes back to $420 next week, as long as the war ends soon, it is possible for SPY to surge to $500 later this year. Ukraine war will be much more transitory compared to inflation. As long as there is no WW3, we can safely assume that the economic damage to US via sanctions will be small, and most of the negative effect is towards higher inflation due to higher oil price.

Hence, I think that the long-term main factor that decides whether the stock market will surge, flat, or fall is inflation and how the Fed's policy pans out to bring the inflation back to 2%. 

On Wednesday, the Fed made it clear that there would be 7 rate hikes this year. This was different from their previous attitude where they chose not to tell how many rate hikes planned for next 2 to 3 years. This previous ""indifferent"" attitude resulted in uncertainties perceived by the market. Will the Fed increase the rate hike by 2% overnight? Will the Fed have 10+ rate hikes this year? Market hates uncertainties, and thus the initial crash before the war crash a month ago.

As the Fed now makes it clear how many rate hikes will be introduced in next 2 to 3 years, this sent the signal to the market that the Fed knows how to combat inflation (at least the market is more confident with the Fed now). Otherwise, the Fed will not tell us how many rate hikes to introduce. This also implies that recession is less likely to happen as the Fed now appears to know what they are doing compared to 2 months ago.

Inflation is not necessarily bad for stock market. Inflation means higher rates, which means higher profits for value stocks. Think companies like Walmart who can charge higher price for their goods. For most of growth stocks, it is not good due to reduced cash flow. However, for big tech companies like Apple and Amazon, they can also charge higher price for their products (iPhone, Prime membership fee), which neutralizes the effect. With the big tech companies constitute higher precentage of the stock market, this means that higher rates do not necessarily mean bad things to the stock market. Furthermore, many big tech companies have their own program of buying shares back, which serves as a catalyst of higher stock price in future. This is in addition to the fact that, in long-term, stock price will increase with inflation (if goods price increases, so should the stock price as long as the number of shares are around the same).

To sum up, it is likely that SPY will surge during later part of the year, and may even surpass $500 and reach $500. April can still be a bear month, but September, October, November and December are much more likely bull months.",1

"My Prediction For Rest of Week (AMD Tendies)Okay another prediction time. As some may know, I've made some good ones in my short month as a member. If you followed me and did what I said you'd be way green. I've made about 12k since being a member.. It started after antitrust news and I predicted a surging ADBE because it dropped and had nothing to do with that, then went on and predicted FBs huge rise when it was at a laughable 170, my latest gem was a couple days ago when I predicted a quick rise in CRM. And while CRM is likely not done and will reach 160s by next week, I'm on to new things.

Admittedly, this new prediction isn't my usual variety. I tend to target stocks that have fallen for what I consider fake reasons, and are due for a recovery to their normal trading range. Thos is normally news related drops. Was the case with ADBE, FB, and CRM. All of which are back to their ranges so new opportunity is limited, but CRM still has potential. This new prediction isn't technically undervalued, or even below its normal trading range, two metrics I normally use, but it is affected by recent news that could affect it and recent price movement that helps gauge it. I'll explain.

Prediction: AMD for tomorrow, and possibly Friday. It could reach as high as 34, but probably closer to 32. It was trading in the 27-29.5 range for weeks, back and forth, so we already know it is capable of seesawing. Once it broke 29.5 resistance that is now its support, so I don't expect a drop lower than that without some devastating news. It closed near 30.5 today and didn't go much lower for long, good sign. Here's why the prediction. When Trump tweeted something recently about meeting Xi it went above 32. This shows trade concerns weigh heavily on AMD, and chips in general. The FED just gave their rate plan and the markets will begin pricing in a 100% chance of a rate cut in July. This pricing in should affect whole market tomorrow, but maybe moreso on China related stocks. The rate cuts are largely to counter damage done by Trumps trade war. Damage that would be done to AMD and other chip stocks. Since the damage will be mitigated without a shadow of a doubt now, I see a rise incoming for AMD closer to the post Trump tweet about meeting with Xi, which should be around 32, but small chance of higher. 

So get AMD calls at open if no gap up. I got them at end of day today, and throught as it dipped. Good luck all. As a warninf, my confidence level on this prediction is not nearly as high as my previous predictions (which were 100% confidence), but I still believe in it.",0

"$ATVI free money even if MSFT deal falls through.Hey fellow autists, I recently opened some plays that look too good to be true. 
$ATVI is getting purchased by MSFT in an all-cash transaction for $96 a share. The deal is expected to close in 2023. 

The play: debit spreads for Jan 2024 where you buy 1 call at the 80 strike and sell 1 call at the 95 strike. 
This currently costs about 8.5 and you would make 6.5 max. So 6.5/8.5 = 76% return on investment. 

Best case scenario: the deal closes in 2023. Since it is an all cash deal, the options do not get converted to MSFT options. You get the max. 

Worse case scenario: the deal gets rejected. ATVI tanks back to 70. Now, the good news? There is no ceiling at 96 anymore. So the long-dated options might see their price increase or stay the same. Take a look at $EA. Current strike calls for Jan 2024 has a breakeven of 18%. The $ATVI one is at 10%. 

Positions: 50 debit spreads 80 and 95 expiring Jan 2024.",1

"Bezos, Cow Farts, and You: How $AMZN's deal w/ $CLNE is the most confusing in at least 30 seconds; unwinding it so people will stop being so ignorant about it.Hello, ""Apes"".  it is I...also....ape.  Yes, ape.  Here to bless you with lots of rocket emojis and bananas as I am clearly one of you.  Or something.  We still say on fleek, right? I mean, I totally know, but I'm not sure if you, too, are...you know, fellow ape....

&amp;#x200B;

Hmm, it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard.  This makes fellow ape very angry, and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this, ape honor.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I've seen an enormous amount of confusion from the, you know, ""non-apes"", about what $CLNE's contract with $AMZN is.  So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don't get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information.  So let's talk about it:

&amp;#x200B;

# What's the deal:

&amp;#x200B;

In late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide.  This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN's warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

The first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today's value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don't know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they'll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.

&amp;#x200B;

# Now, the part the less intelligent ""non-apes"" don't seem to grasp, but the most important part:

&amp;#x200B;

Less discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they've got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it's the part most people don't seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they're paying, which means it's in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as ""gently nudging"" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean ""waterboarding until they comply"".  You're already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why does any of this matter?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, ""fellow ape"", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it's this:  If $AMZN's ""win"" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to ""win"", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE's price should not be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN is paying, that's wrong, and everybody who's been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN's cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn't agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.

&amp;#x200B;

So there the ""non apes"" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn't get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO'd into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn't understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can't.  Jeff's not as wise an ape as a WSB ape.

QCOM made some big announcements today around new auto partnerships. Seems like these guys are partnering up with a whole set of new OEMs to enable the software-defined cars of the future. 

All those software-defined cars will need high efficiency / low latency silicone materials such as the Next Gen SiC Modules that WOLF makes. 

And preferably all these chips will made in America. Not the imported chinese stuff. You know because its a geopolitical thang now and American car buyers should support the industrial ecosystem at home.

You will be surprised when money flies back into some stocks next week.

Fed Reverse Repo hit an ATH on 6/17. People think the dollar got stronger. 

What happened here is the Fed agreed to borrow some more money out from the financial institutions by writing IOUs. The IOUs will be bought back at a higher price by the FED. Here‚Äôs how the conversation went.

Banking Institutions: Aye yo big brother, I got too much stimmys in storage. Got anything for me to buy?

FED: They arnt throwing it in the stock market?! How much this time?

Institutions: Not much just 752bn

FED: alright park the cash here. I‚Äôll write up something for you.

Scribbles* IOU. Face value $756bn, interest 0.5%. 

Institutions: wicked, so much better than bag holding. Here‚Äôs $752bn. 

14 days later - printer turns on.
$1bn, $2bn, $3bn, $4bn.

* SPY traded in a bear flag pre-market and opened at the backtest level of bear flag break
* SPY neared the 364.51 - 363.40 pt on scalping chart and traded in a wedge and rectangle from 8:00 UTC-6 - 9:08 UTC-6, rejecting off the 50 MA.

* Full measured move out of rectangle - wedge was 364.09 and we hit that around 10:32 UTC-6 after rejecting the 50 MA again.
* We then traded in another rectangle for 2 hours or so. We rejected off the 50 MA and hit a double top. We broke out of the rectangle around 12:22 and floated around backtest area until we rejected the 50 MA again at 13:04.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&gt;Wall Street received a reality check, as data revealed a hot labor market, which will likely keep the Federal Reserve on its aggressive hiking trail. Stocks fell as a result of those bets, propelling benchmark treasury yields to their longest weekly gain since 1984.  
&gt;  
&gt;Almost 95% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 declined. The drop came just a few days after the index posted its biggest back-to-back gains since the pandemic began, amid speculation that the Fed was approaching ""peak hawkishness."" Despite Friday's drop, those gains gave the index its best week in a month. The tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 dropped nearly 4% on Friday.  
&gt;  
&gt;10 Yr yields approached 3.9% as they rose for the 10th week in a row. the dollar advanced. The swap contract for the Fed meeting in November factored in nearly 75 basis points of tightening. Market-implied expectations for where the rate will peak also increased, with the derivative contract for the March gathering trading around 4.66%. the current range for the benchmark rate stands between 3% and 3.25%.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fed Bank of New York President John Williams stated that rates need to gradually rise to around 4.5%, but the pace and ultimate peak of the tightening campaign will be determined by how the economy performs. Several officials delivered a resolutely hawkish message this week, saying that price pressures remain elevated and that financial market volatility will not deter them from raising rates.  
&gt;  
&gt;After a hotter-than-expected reading in August dampened hopes of a nascent slowdown, all eyes will be on next week's US inflation data. Separately, the Fed's September meeting minutes could reveal the central bank's tolerance for economic pain.  
&gt;  
&gt;Investors poured the most money into cash since April 2020, fearing a looming recession, but stocks could fall further because they don't fully reflect that risk, according to Bank of America strategists. According to their report, cash funds received nearly $89 billion in the week ending October 5th, while investors withdrew $3.3 billion from global stock funds.

Here is the outlook rest of month. Looking to the downside to try to get this leg down to 336.61 by Oct. 26 with low-end 325.64. This would put us around 1.618 - 342.52 - trend fib from Aug. highs and around pre-covid crash. The only event that could put a wrench in this analysis is a surprise CPI print on Oct. 13 so be mindful. I personally wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable swinging until CPI data but to each their own

* MSFT is great at gaming but are hard to predict because of how diversified their revenue is. Will they try to grow office software and cloud more than metaverse and game technology?
* GOOG is known to have the best engineering talent of any company in the world. They contribute the most to Linux, Android, and unknown to most people - also the most advanced video and audio codecs such as AV1 and Opus (which are like 90% more efficient than previous codecs). They also have the best smartphone (or tied with Samsung) the Pixel phones.
   * Google is also pushing gaming heavily with Stadia and just announced metaverse glasses.
* AMZN is a retailer but has a massive web presence. Like Google, they also contribute to Linux so have some proven engineering talent. What will they do with it though? Do they want to make the metaverse, or just sell it?
* NVDA is obviously trying to be the hardware and software company behind the power of the metaverse, but they have serious competition from AMD.
* FB isn't going anywhere soon. Massive spyware company, you can't ignore them. Meta Quest is the most advanced headset so far, and also somehow the cheapest. You have to give Zuckerberg some credit, Meta's cashflow is being spent exactly how he said it would.

"Citadel, Melvin - Why Options didn't trade for 15 mins today. Long GME, go üêªon SPY QQQLike many of you I woke up today trying to see if I was gonna hit my second M and was a little shocked at seeing that I couldn't get a bid or ask on any options that I had. I have literally never seen this before, and honestly I didn't know it was legal for MM to not offer any bids or asks at all.

I've also been wondering why Citadel bailed out Melvin. What is their relationship? Well see, Citadel is one of the largest market makers in the US. They are the ones that sell us the options that let us weaponize degen and yolo into riches that we promptly burn up. Citadel also holds a large short position, so presumably they bailed out Melvin because they did not want to start a liquidity cascade that was gonna eat them alive too.

Questions I've been wondering and I think I have a theory for

1. Melvin was supposed to go BK at GME 175. They claimed they exited their short. What happened?
2. If you go here [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link) 3rd page Melvin has had 54k put positions on GME since 2015. Who wrote those?
3. How did GME get naked shorted when only Market Makers are allowed to naked short?

I suspect that Melvin did go BK today. They got acquired by Citadel. They bought those put options from Citadel and Citadel has held the naked short position all these years. Risk management at these market maker desks will absolutely pull a bid and not offer if they think they are at risk of blowing up the firm. IMO Citadel market maker desk didn't trade shit the first 15 minutes of the day because they were trying to figure out what the fuck to do. I don't know if they made a last minute deal this morning or pulled capital together or what but they are on their fucking last leg.

Look at Melvins long positions, a lot of them fucking sold off heavy early today. PINS. PYPL. JD. NFLX. IMO options were not traded by Citadel during first 15 minutes today while they sold off what they needed from Melvin to maintain liquidity.

I made this post a few weeks ago about why market indices are at a risk this week and last week if we see any red. Gamma is basically almost negative. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz0jn/been\_too\_long\_since\_weve\_had\_a\_bearpocalypse\_post/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzz0jn/been_too_long_since_weve_had_a_bearpocalypse_post/)

Citadel is almost BK and everyone can fucking smell it. We get one last big green on GME IMO and that will be the death kneel of Citadel. I don't know if it happens thursday, or friday, but it's coming. You YOLO on some 550c expiring Friday if you see volume in them. IF you see market red as shit tomorrow, you buy index puts and puts on whatever Melvin and Citadels longs were and you lean into it because not only is Citadel going to liquidate but the whole market is likely to go with it.

Good luck

SPY traded in a bull flag during the AM, until about 9:00 UTC-6. It then had a nice uptrend until about 12:30 UTC-6 and dumped to 428 before a bounce. SPY essential traded within a range-to-slight uptrend day. We did hold that 427 target that was talked about in yesterday‚Äôs post.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Investors weighed the latest round of upbeat earnings against a backdrop of growing concerns about slowing growth and rising borrowing costs as US stocks closed higher following a sharp drop in tech shares.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
The S&amp;P 500 managed to post modest gains in a volatile session that included a sharp drop after the index failed to break through its 200-day moving average. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 finished lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average maintained its lead among major benchmarks, rising 0.7%.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
In a session marked by steep losses and gains, equity markets see-sawed. Short-dated yields, which are the most sensitive to interest-rate changes, rose more than five basis points.  
Stocks began the day lower as investors weighed the latest mixed economic data with the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates. Data released on Tuesday showed a larger-than-expected drop in US home construction, while US factory output increased in July for the first time in three months.

## Where are we on the Chart?

Two things. We are near potential downtrend resistance from ATH - around 430 - 432. And bulls are working on their third leg. The third leg would put us at around 437.66. If bulls can hold 430 - I believe that we shall get that third leg. Again, important for bulls to hold 427 if we see downside tomorrow - I‚Äôd prefer they hold 429.6 if we open flat. Lose 427 and i‚Äôll be looking for 424.9 - 423 ish for buyers to come in at that level with volume to the buy side.

Next major value area is 436 - 439 - 443

"I'm sitting on 60k of NVDA and AMD stock that dipped quite hard, thoughts?So 60k presently but I bought close to the top of the pump last november. First was 40k, then did another 40k on the way down fortunately. But had no idea it would go back so low. These are stocks that basically got manipulated +50% and then returned to baseline.

I think I am going to sell once they cross my dollar cost average. I am then going to put most of it into a more stable megacap like GOOG MSFT AMZN. Then if it crashes again, I will re-enter with a smaller, more reasonable amount.

I calculated that this overall has/will cost me like $100 in SEC fees but that means nothing to me if I can stop seeing this bullshit pump and dumps in my portfolio. Since I am not actually gaining any cash from this, I don't expect taxes will be a big deal either.

"$METAIn relation to the comments made today about meta and the metaverse I wanted to leave my two cents.

1. It was mentioned that meta‚Äôs ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù concept has been laughed off by a few people

2. The overwhelming success of oculus  is catalyst 

On that note I thought it might be worth clarifying what is ‚Äúthe metaverse‚Äù

What we consider ‚Äúthe metaverse‚Äù is essentially and world you can interact socially in. World of Warcraft is a metaverse, as is Fortnite as is the oculus spaces meta is creating. Collectively these all make up ‚Äúthe metaverse‚Äù the conocensus is that we should gravitate towards a technology where the metaverse is like the web, and each ‚Äúspace‚Äù is like a website we can visit. 

Facebooks interpretation is just one facet of this.

Why is this important? 

Because as mentioned above and on the call, 80% of the vr market is oculus, and by extension meta. So even if their metaverse concept is a flop, it will probably be their devices were connecting with. And they will figure out how to monetize that.


On that note, why is occulus dominating vr? For two reasons, they are taking apples approach to this space.

Steam is like google. They have an open platform, that manufacturers can tap into, htc, Hp, etc. these are just hardware executions to steams vr platform. Like google/android, it‚Äôs fragmented with each manufacturer having different variants of vr, each with different tracking technologies. From a development perspective, this is going yo be a nightmare.

Occulus on the other hand, not only connects to steam, is easy to use and setup, and most importantly, is the only headset WITH ITS OWN PLATFORM 

Occulus has its own ‚Äúhome‚Äù, own works apps, own events, own social spaces, and I guarantee you these will all integrate.

So until apple enters the space, meta is the apple of vr",1

The rest of you! My pops offered to run a screen for me in his model. I threw out five stocks that I was either looking at, or heard about from some of you lovely ""investors"" on here.

I picked:

NVDA

TSLA

SBUX

TWLO

MTCH

and DIS.

He threw in a few of his own. Most of them failed the screen! This doesn't mean they're bad short-term / swing plays. It only means they're not the best long-term ones.

The only two to pass, which means they're recommended as strong **buy and hold plays - ACIW and NVDA.**

I'm not your financial advisor, so I'm not gonna create elaborate cases for both, especially for a company like NVDA which you should already know about.

ACIW is a fintech stock (very similar to SQ), and they seem to have been chugging along quite well the past six months. There's another potential catalyst coming next week, so I'm planning on entering a long position before then.

"Getting Technical: SPY DD(10/2/19)Drill Spy the Buy Puts Guy here with some technical analysis on $SPY in preparation for Wedneaday, October 2nd. 

*Safety glasses on*
.
On October 1st, $SPY(-1.19%) saw it's biggest one day drop in over a month off of weak manufacturing news.  President Tariff Man's outlook on trade talks has changed to a much more negative tone the past few tweets, and it seems the impeachmeant news has him thrown off his stonks game. 

    If he can regain his focus and use his tweets to pump efficiently, we may see SPY rebound by the EOW, but as of now, he seems more focused on attempted pumps on auto stocks nobody gives a fuck about. Unless Trump regains his true bull self, expect SPY to continue it's downtrend for the week considering there has been literally zero positive political or economic news this week. In other words, the stock market is ON FUCKING FIRE. 

As for October 2nd, look for $SPY  to rally at open. If it breaks 294.25 early, expect a flat-to-mildly green day, before a big drop the rest of the week. On the opposite side, if we break through 293.00 on the downside, expect all hell to break loose and $SPY to close around 290. 

In conclusion, barring Tariff man going full Bull Gang, expect another red day tomorrow because there is absolutely no fucking reason for a green day at all. Buy puts motherfuckers cause SPY is gonna DRILL! DRILL! DRILL!

*Safety Glasses off*

TLDR: $SPY is gonna DRILL! DRILL! DRILL! tomorrow. Buy puts it is free fucking money.",1

This is a pretty big kick in the pants. RayTracing is the ""big"" thing their stock is surging on, but 60 FPS @ 1080P? 

AND this is completely dependent on leveraging Nvidia's 3-step rendering process to hit these performance targets, which includes their traditional rendering pipeline, their AI-guided anti-aliasing, AND their RTX implementation. Any ""pure"" RayTracing implementation (via DX12 or Vulkan) that doesn't have all of Nvidia's implementation components is going to suffer.

Seems like Nvidia's trying to ride a wave here with the release and pre-order without allowing reviews of the hardware to go out (under NDA.)

"A deep dive look into Meta Income Statement as well as what their EPS might look like without reality labsThe 4th picture will show you what their EPS would look like if we take out reality labs. I will however go through the other 3 pictures to explain the current situation

[Meta analysis 1](https://imgur.com/CRnf0I4)

Meta revenue came in -4.5% lower than the sept 2021 same quarter. As you can see, in 2021, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 64 cents was going to costs. In 2022, for every 1 dollar of revenue, 80 cents is going to cost. We're seeing a 45.66% decline in operating income. Also they are paying 21.18% in taxes which we will use later in our picture 4 calculation.

[Meta analysis 2](https://imgur.com/Qk325WQ)

In the 2021 quarter, eps came in at 3.22 and in the 2022 quarter, eps came in at 1.64. That is essentially a 49% drop. If we're looking at diluted shares outstanding, the number declined by 6% meaning they are outpacing stock based compensation with their buyback program. Their total share based comp expense has increased 31.74% which is understandable given they are growing a new revenue segment

[Meta Analysis 3](https://imgur.com/IUKfISN)

The information here shows the revenue segments and as we can see, from the 2021 quarter to the 2022 quarter, reality labs revenue dropped by 48.92% and the family of apps revenue dropped by 3.6%. Given that reality labs is the segment they are pouring money into, this is highly unwelcoming news. This quarters loss on the reality labs segment also came in significantly higher and compared to 2021 quarter, was 39.57% higher.

[Meta Analysis 4](https://imgur.com/GAb3pG9)

Now if we remove reality labs, EPS would come in around 2.71 versus the 1.64 we got.  That is a 65.24% increase on EPS. Keep in mind that there are shared expenses and getting rid of a segment may not be as oversimplified as I have shown here.

"SPY said pssst hey kids. Stonks only go upDespite playing a risky yolo put play coming in today that obviously didnt work out. i was lucky enough to be able to set a limit sell for both at a 20% loss while I was asleep.

woke up just in time to see that dip near 470.4 and load up on some calls. went long on a 1/18 473C, 1/26 472C and a 2/2 472C. There profits are already negating my morning loss. looking at the 30 min we have a clear ascending triange that normal would be considered an indication of a dip. but i suspect because the upper limits from pre market we will rally and establish a new upward parallel channel. looking at a impending daily buy on MACD and zoomed out on daily that ascending triangle looks more like a parallel upward channel. Wouldnt be surprised to see her finish today near 474.

i suspect we see a run by next week to test the recent high near 483.

from there at 483 we need to see if she is going to rejected or break that white dotted trend line.

"The bull market ends this year, thanks to Trump. He might escalate the current trade war, start a real war in North Korea to distract the country from the results of the Mueller investigation, and send SPY puts and the VIX to the moon. [Serious post]This past week has been interesting in the markets. Today and yesterday especially. 

We have a president who is not afraid to set the world on fire, so to speak. He has no qualms about destroying the current world order (which has been so good to commerce and the stock market so far). 

Trump's first year was marked by restraint, thanks to his advisers. A tax bill was drawn up and passed, and no one went to war. However, as he has gotten more comfortable with the authority vested to him as President, it appears that Trump's darker instincts have taken hold. And as we all know, one of Trump's most consistent views is his disdain for international trade and desire for autarky. 

We got a trade war this week. I do not believe that Trump will let down or is actually bluffing. Even if the Chinese offer to negotiate, I doubt Trump actually wants to negotiate. He believes that tariffs will force America to make its own stuff again. That is the true aim of this trade war, it's to dissuade firms from importing from abroad and make their own stuff, and employ American workers in the process, to bring about America's former manufacturing prowess. 

It is a fundamental ideological view he has held for more than 30 years. We need to sell more to other nations, and attain a high degree of self-sufficiency. That is how countries ""win"" at trade. 

Trade wars are devastating. I believe that Trump will escalate the matter further. He does not believe in negotiating, only brow-beating. May 1st is an important date to watch, as it's the date that the exemptions to steel tariffs ends for certain countries like Canada, Mexico, the EU, South Korea, et al. 

The result of a trade war is increased inflation, as consumers pay more to get their stuff. Increased inflation will pressure the Fed to raise rates more quickly than anticipated, and with that goes economic growth and the bull market. Banks are especially under pressure. While increased rates help net interest revenue, if fewer people are borrowing as a result, why would it even matter?

The second threat to the bull market is political instability from the 2018 mid-terms and the Mueller investigation. Trump feels threatened by these two things. If Democrats take back the House, they can start restraining him a little. Mueller could release a report that puts Trump in a poor light and perhaps recommend him for impeachment. Trump is an authoritarian, and does not believe in accountability from other government institutions. What might he do to draw attention away from these things? He could start a war. 

With hawks like Pompeo and Bolton on board, I believe that Trump will launch some sort of first strike on North Korea to distract everyone from the results of Mueller's investigation and undercut Congressional authority in the name of ""national security"". 

The results of a Second Korean War? Supply chains to Asia will be disrupted, an important trading partner will have its economy flushed down the toilet, and increased government spending to fund such a war will stretch the United States' financial resources to the limit. 

Look at the charts from yesterday and today. Massive downward selling pressure on high volume towards the end of the day. BTFD is seemingly gone. The market is nervous about the possible things President Trump could do and is re-pricing assets accordingly. 

Conservatively, there's not much one can do. If you are long call options, it's time to GTFO. If you are long stock, and have a time horizon of more than 10 years, it's fine to continue holding (but it will bleed in the meantime). 

If you are 100% cash, I recommend that you stuff 75% of it into a savings account. Use the other 25% to sell long-dated OTM bear call spreads, purchases of long-dated index puts, or long-dated VIX calls. Perhaps even gold mining stocks if you like gold, since it's always a safe haven. 

Tread carefully.

"$SPY Trend Channel Shows You Where Buyers and Sellers Trade**DAILY TREND CHANNEL**

SPY's daily trend channel is trending upwards. It was trading above the upper side of the median and broke below to the lower half last September. It's currently trading this year on that lower half of median channel and still threatening to go lower.

"$FSR held to rise 3.5% this week, on expected news and higher volumes, while SPY fell 5%.EV maker Fisker [$FSR ($9.06) continued to hold against market forces this week](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fsr/analystestimates), and even gain 3.5% on volume and with news that was largely expected, and a new analyst ""buy"" rating with a [$12 price target](https://uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/needham-upgrades-tesla-to-hold-launches-coverage-on-3-other-ev-stocks-432SI-2751437). [More](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/fisker-hits-a-major-milestone-on-road-to-affordable-evs-for-all?puc=yahoo&amp;cm_ven=YAHOO) [good PR](https://fiskerati.com/fsr/fisker-shares-outperform-this-week-as-the-machine-has-started/) and [unrelated news items](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/09/16/final-trades-mo-tlt-fsr.html) are also beginning to take note of the long-time EV underdog as the rumor mill gets started ahead of production.

[Most analysts have FSR as a ""buy"" or ""hold""](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/fsr/analyst-research), with near term price targets ranging from $10-$15, going as high as $20. FSR also beat its most recent earnings.

Noting that [short interest is currently &gt; 28%](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest), at 45,642,188 shares, with FSR being the 27th most shorted security on the list. In the previous 52 week period, Fisker has traded as high as $23.75 and more recently as low as $7.95. $FSR is currently trading right around $9.00.

For those who haven't been watching, *FSR is sitting on cash as it goes into production in November*, currently about 60 days out. The company has approaching 60,000 confirmed reservations, a modest but loyal cult following, a somewhat-polarizing CEO with an established name in the industry, and is outsourcing production to [Magna Steyr](https://www.magna.com/company/company-information/magna-groups/magna-steyr) (who are an established vehicle manufacturing leader, and also produce vehicles for BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar, etc). Although the initial Fisker vehicles likely won't qualify for US tax incentives, demand remains strong both in the US and European markets, and long term plans include US production of future models.

Personally, near term I am expecting FSR to rise a bit on rumors as we approach production in November, after which the initial reception of the vehicles will probably predict the price action going forward. **My current positions** are 225 calls and 60 calendar spreads targeting a near term (@60dte) price action in the $11-$14 range, with leaps for 2024 starting at $15. This is not quite a YOLO for me, but it is a significant bet, and I actually believe in the stated outcomes.

FSR is probably not a Tesla killer and may not survive the rapidly changing EV market going forward, and I'm not here to say that it is, Fisker needs to prove that on its own.

My argument is simply that, *at this time*, this is a [real company](https://www.fiskerinc.com/), sitting on cash, with real customers, [good PR](https://fiskerati.com/) creating actual demand, respected manufacturing business partners, trading near its all time low, a couple of months before the long-awaited deliveries begin. I believe there is short term upside potential on the growing rumor/news cycle, and if the cars are well received, it *could* be a long term player with a novel business model for the industry.

The ideal next week:
- Google fucks up on earnings
- Google tanks the entire market
- Use my profits from shorting google to reinvest in cheap Facebook/Amazon
- Facebook/Amazon/Twitter hit it out of the park and I am mega rich

The most probable outcome:

- Google does well in earnings
- My puts go to zero, but the entire market is lifted.
- I have so much more in calls than puts that I end up the day positive
- Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter report good earnings and I still end up rich at end of week

---

The also likely scenario:

- Google does well in earnings
- My puts go to zero, but the entire market is lifted.
- I have so much more in calls than puts that I end up the day positive
- Facebook and Amazon report great earnings, but Twitter fucks up because of the bot thing
- End up in the green because FB/AMZN calls outweigh twitter and google fuckups

"AAPL is angry that meme stocks like BBBY are getting all the attentionSince the middle of June 2022, the Apple Plunge Protection Liquidity Engineers (APPLE) have been using their 3 Trillion dollar hedge fund money to aggressively and assertively guarantee that AAPL stock goes up in a straight line.  Seriously, go look at the chart, it's absolutely uncanny.  

This is with no new actual news from Apple, nothing about better phones, better laptops, nothing about new Apple Watches or new services.   Just Tim Apple telling his people ""Do so many Stock Buybacks that the stock price makes an UNMISTAKABLE LINE STRAIGHT UP.""

This should be the only thing anyone is talking about.  Stock that was 130 two months ago is 175 today, guaranteed to be 180 tomorrow and 200 not long afterwards. 

Yet every single chumchugger on this web sight is talking about nothing but Bed Bath and Beyond.   

AAPL and the APPLE team are very angry about this development.   Financial engineering so blatantly obvious so as to guarantee profits for anyone who buys AAPL shares.  And this is the thanks they get?

"Don't forget: AMZN is doing a historic 20-for-1 split soonAs the title says, AMZN is gonna do a historic 20-for-1 split and its finally coming. I want to be part of history. I think this is bullish despite the mess the market is currently in. A bear market rally is over due as well. This could align the stars to make AMZN a good swing trade until after the split.

So when is it exactly?

https://investorplace.com/2022/03/when-is-the-amazon-stock-split-date-what-will-happen-to-amzn-stock/

&gt; The first will be May 27, 2022, which will serve as the record date. That means if you want to participate in the stock split, you must own AMZN stock by May 27. Individual accounts will start to update to reflect the stock split by June 3, 2022. Finally, AMZN will start trading on what is called a split-adjusted basis by June 6, 2022. That is when investors will start to notice the lower share price.

I'm pretty sure there's gonna be plenty of confusion about the record date and the ""must own"" phrasing of the above text, but this date doesn't really matter since its just for accounting purposes and the right to the new shares just transfers if you sell/buy after the record date:

&gt; Record date: This is an important date when it comes to accounting, but it isn't terribly important for investors to know. The record date is when existing shareholders need to own the stock in order to be eligible to receive new shares created by a stock split. However, if you buy or sell shares between the record date and the effective date, the right to the new shares transfers. 

So, the effective date is the important date though:

&gt;Effective date: The date when the new shares show up in investors' brokerage accounts and the shares trade on a split-adjusted basis.

You can just google ""AMZN split effective date"" and it should show June 6 as well. So next week is the last week AMZN trades above 2000 and then it will trade at 1/20 the price and everyone is made whole by having 20x the amount of shares.

What about options?

The options clearing committee will also automatically adjust the strike prices and for each option you hold you get 20x options of the new strike price on the effective date.

That means if you are getting calls divide them by 20 to see if you're getting a nice round number. A 2200 call would be 20x 110 calls on June 6. A 2105 call would get you weird 105.25 call options that might have liquidity problems later.",1

Intraday today you can see the bulls had a small movement early morning which I mentioned in my morning premarket I posted to the server was possible and from there the bears just ate all day long. The bearish volume just kept flowing in and never stopped. With an impressive total range today of $14.66 which hit 153% of the average true range of $9.56.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nf8vfss13kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=790c5abb2c522b791f8596c4f0c884a5113808d1

We are in such an impressive bear channel right now and such a violent bear channel that if it breaks 410 Monday we very well could see below 400 by Wednesday before FOMC. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qw8bgle23kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1024f388939b9eacc977f556151dffe291f1a07

On the daily we are at an impressive point to say the least. We failed to reach the low of February 24th by about $0.60. the low of 410.64 is the most recent low. With us hitting 411.21 intraday one COULD call 411 a double bottom potential. 

I am still working on a theory that we are in a sideways (blue) channel from 415 to 458 with a few outliers here and there. So if SPY is able to within one or two more candles return to and hold above 415 it think my theory holds true. 

However I am also working that theory of the red bear channel which gives us a low of 400 by EOW (May 6th) or if we are within the orange bear channel we could see 394 within the next two weeks if we continue a steady decline.

I shared this weekly chart last week which show how we very well could be headed for a true bear market and could see the weekly chart touch the 200 ema at 360 for the first time since the Covid crash, and before that was the 2018 crash. 405.88 is currently the weekly 100ema and will be interesting to see if SPY can hold above that next week or not. If spy was to lose that next week I think we all but would guaranteed a visit to the 200 ema of the next few months. 

On the current trajectory we could see the 200ema at 360 by middle of July. 

As you can see we have a fuck ton of bearish momentum ahead and formed this week. It will be VERY important for bulls to not let this drop below 405 this week and definitely not let it stay below 405 this week. 

My personal take is that we are not going to break 400 YET. I think we are going to see 400-405 Monday or Tuesday (about a 60-70% chance) and then Wednesday when FOMC happens JPOW is going to use his fancy works and nimble tools to rally the market like last time. As long as JPOW doesn‚Äôt throw a 100bps hike out there (whether we need it or not) the market should rally. The recent narrative is that inflation has peaked so realistically we should hear JPOW be singing that tune this week. 

However, IF like January JPOW gets up there and acts scared or says some off the wall stuff we are going to see 380-390 EOW without a doubt. There is a pretty good case to argue Monday we will see some sort of relief rally. A -4% drop on realistically a nothing burger is going to have some sort of relief. I would suspect us to revisit 415-420 on Monday. That doesn‚Äôt mean Tuesday may not drill us to 400-410 though. Current downward trend/ extreme bear channel resistance line for Monday is at 420. If bulls can rally the troops and break that we may see a bigger relief rally headed into Wednesday FOMC.

I had mentioned earlier this month that we had some consolidation periods that were followed by rallys. We do appear to be making another one of those periods right now if you look at the blue circles followed by the blue arrows. Each of those hit 450-460 range. If this one drops slightly lower around 400 it would be safe to say we could rally to 440-450 range. 

The daily RSI is also starting to become very oversold finally hitting 35. This RSI is the same exact RSI that SPY rallied from in February and March. I will be very curious to see what FOMC and next week brings. I am going long here though at these levels well slowly entering long which I will touch on in my positions and the end of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apple had quite the red day today, of course not the same 5% green it had the day before, but after that earnings beat followed by not so great guidance it saw a -3.66% red day. 

Apple finished back under its daily 200ema. I had mentioned that breaking back under the 200ema is not a good sign for apple. Apple has not had two candles in a row below the 200 ema since the Covid crash. Another candle Monday below the 8ema would be the first time in 2 years. 

Apple also had a great upper channel resistance rejection this morning at 166.

If apple continues this trajectory downward we could see 145 range by middle to end of May.

On the weekly chart Apple has not broke its 50ema currently at 154.57 since covid crash. Currently Apple bounced off that 50ema this week and on the current trajectory is about to see it broken this week if it doesn‚Äôt see some serious upside. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w9t8fx163kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96fa025c14b2846bb031ec97f0cc81bd1521f296

QQQ is on an impressive downward trajectory and is the first of Apple, SPY and QQQ to break its low from February. It will be interesting to see if QQQ will bounce this week or not. Its pretty safe to assume that until QQQ bounces SPY most likely will not bounce either. 

I had mentioned that 310-315 was a key level to watch for QQQ and we hit there today. 

I will be watching to see if QQQ will break upwards towards 318, 322 and 328 resistance or if its gonna continue this trajectory and see 300 by the end of week. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s4navxm63kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b487587b68af408ed9c6a8ab1f31bb61ba0c354

QQQ weekly charts actually on an impressively aggressive downward trend right now. It also unlike the February and March it closes a almost full candle below the weekly 100ema of 324.81. As you can imagine the last time that happened was the covid crash. 

There currently is a fairly good argument we COULD see the weekly 200ema at 276 before the end of the month of May. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s7g7s0773kw81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c75164fc17b18776781577187d92b8e5119b23ff

The VIX is going to be something to watch over the next week and where it opens Monday. If you remember I said a week or 2 ago that until we get something to spook the markets and the VIX can get back near 35-40 SPY had no chance of seeing 400. Well I stand by the fact that we really have had nothing to spook the market, it just conveniently just all of a sudden remembered that inflations is bad and covid/ supply chains are bad. Earnings this week arguably was the catalyst the market needed to spike the vix and see these levels again. 

Looking at the VIX daily chart our happy spot is 28 to 33.5. I will be watching for those key levels next week as we head into FOMC. With the added ‚Äúfear‚Äù of FOMC on Wednesday we may see the VIX hit that key 40 level. 

I do believe if the VIX keeps rising we very well could see 400 Monday or Tuesday. However, I think a lot of that fear of the market and fear of the inflation unknowns with FOMC will dissipate on Wednesday and by Friday we would see the VIX unwind back down to or below 30. 

Looking back at February the VIX range at heights was 28.5 to 32.5 with a two big spikes to 39 and 36. In March the heights had us at 28 to 34.3 with a few spikes up to 36 and 37. So its safe to say while we may see a quick spike to or above 35 it would be pretty safe to assume that it would be short lived and be the next day or at least two days later their would be a dip in the vix and relief rally in spy. 

Looking at this more I do for see how we could hold around this level Monday and Tuesday. See a massive spike Wednesday only to see FOMC bring the vix down and start the next short term bull run. Unless the FOMC can reveal something terrible that is going to keep the VIX held and based here above 32 and even close to 40 there really isn‚Äôt in my opinion a big enough catalyst to see sub 400. 

Doing a quick look back since the Covid Crash anytime the VIX has spike intraday over 35 and especially anytime it has hit 37-40 it has within a week feel back down and fallen hard. This week if I happen to catch a day where VIX spikes to 37 to 40 I will hit up some 14dte OTM calls banking on that massive relief rally.

I made 54 total trades this week (25 calls and 29 puts)

Win rate- 74% 

Put win rate-72.4% 

Call win rate- 72% win rate 

My biggest loss came from a bad bounce on a 0dte put on Monday (still haunts me because it bounce hard and then would have been green). MY biggest win came from a call. 

Weekly profit goal- $2500

Actual week profit- $4,247 

This was a very tough week for me where I suffered some very large losses especially on Monday that I had to overcome throughout the week. Going into today I barely was green for the week but I was able to have a killer day intraday today. 

8 of my 54 trades were 3 dte or higher for a win rate of 62.5% 

46 of my 54 trades were 0-2 dte for a win rate of 76%

My weekly goal was to have a win rate of 80% which I fell short of. I am pretty content with the overall 74% win rate and for the last two months that has been my average now. I would like to see 80% this week. However, one thing I want to take into account is trades where I exited at less then 10% of a loss. While yes that is a loss and not a win that is me manually exiting a trade because I recognize I entered a bad time, caught a bad bounce, momentum faded, etc. 

There were 6 total losses for less than 10% loss. 

So 40 wins plus 6 calculated/ mitigated losses= 46 or a win rate of 85.2% 

That is something I would like to keep track of over the weeks to. I preach in my server that mitigating losses so that they are manageable to recover from is half the battle. Had Monday and Tuesday I better mitigated losses I would not have had had as big of a hole to get out of end of week. When the momentum dies we need to exit. 

We can ALWAYS re-enter a trade and that‚Äôs what I have done this week a lot when momentum. Get in get 10-20%. Exit. Wait for the second push and re-enter. Time and time again till the momentum completely shifts. 

Hyper wheel update

I sat cash most of today with the hyperwheel knowing we would probably see a -3% day of course I did not expect a -4% day but at the 4165 level I went ahead and resold some of my cash secured puts. So I am back on the hyperwheel right now. As I mentioned I think we are at a near bottom and I have pretty strong faith we will see at or above 415 by EOW again when my puts expire. 

Lastnight I also mentioned I was going to enter some 60dte calls (30 delta) once we hit a bottom as an upside hedge. I did that today. I started at 420 and I plan every $5 we drop to dollar cost average by one contract. I will probably also do that on the way up until we high 425 maybe 430 and then I will let them ride till 440 most likely. At that time I will need to calculate upside vs downside potential to find a good time to take profits. I was very tempted to DCA at 411 today but if we truly hit 410 next week that opportunity will still be there. I am not that worried yet as my current breakeven is 418. Had I averaged down my break even would be closer to 416.3 though. This is a hedge not a full position so I didn‚Äôt and opted for the shorter term 432c way OTM calls. 

I also at 410 today decided to get some 7dte lotto calls for EOW. I have pretty strong faith in a bounce EOW after FOMC and maybe even before FOMC. Perhaps even Monday.

This is the options chain for the calls expiring this week.  3200 was clearly a significant number, and AMZN closed at 3199.95.  That's fucking hilarious.  Someone clearly wanted it below that number.

The daily chart makes it pretty obvious that it's bottomed out.   3180 has been a crucial level many times in the past.  This level is also the point of control, which is where most of the volume has occurred in recent history.  These high volume areas are institutional buying.

&amp;#x200B;

We probably should have corrected more this week, at least to the 50 day moving average for SPY.  That would've been healthy, and it seemed like it tried to every day.  If you made money this week, well done, because I definitely got trapped.  Microsoft just kept popping, along with the rest of big tech except for AMZN.  The fact that every dip was bought up like nothing(especially Monday, what the fuck was that shit) means were probably going higher.  But big tech, the linchpin of the financial world right now, is stretched pretty thin with the exception of AMZN.  I think MSFT cools off next week, and AMZN pumps to keep us painfully churning here.

Position: 8/28 3215c

# April 12 Recap

Stocks fell as oil prices rose above $100 per barrel, reigniting inflation fears, while big banks fell ahead of the start of the financial earnings season on Wednesday.

The S&amp;P 500 erased gains that had previously been driven by speculation that price pressures were nearing a peak. JPMorgan will be the first of the top six banks to report earnings, with Wall Street focusing on how the volatility caused by the Ukraine war affected investment banking and trading operations.

Treasury 10-year yields fell after reaching their highest level since December 2018.

Oil has surpassed $100 per barrel.

The rise in crude oil prices, along with other commodities, has fueled inflation fears, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively. Gasoline prices accounted for half of the monthly increase in the US consumer price index in March. Nonetheless, core inflation increased less than expected, owing in large part to the largest drop in used-car prices since 1969 and a slowing in price growth in other merchandise categories.

On the geopolitical front, Russian President Putin stated that peace talks with Ukraine have stalled and vowed to continue his military operation in the country, despite calling the conflict a ""tragedy."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy has called for additional European Union sanctions against Russia, including oil and all banks.

"S&amp;P DOW JONES INDICES SAYS IT HAS REMOVED TELSA FROM ITS S&amp;P 500 ESG INDEX. $TSLAThe S&amp;P 500 ESG Index, which gauges the performance of securities meeting sustainability standards, has seen its annual rebalancing this month.
Even though S&amp;P 500 follows only major companies, some companies are ahead of their competitors and the rebalancing resulted in the removal of some components, while new companies were added to the index.
Among the companies removed as a part of the rebalancing was also the world‚Äôs largest electric vehicle (EV) maker, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Elon Musk‚Äôs carmaking giant was removed from the index because it was ‚Äúpushed further down the ranks relative to its global industry group peers,‚Äù said Maggie Dorn, Senior Director and Head of ESG Indices, North America at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.


Even though Tesla‚Äôs S&amp;P DJI ESG Score was stable on an annual basis, several factors that changed its score in the index included ‚Äúa decline in criteria level scores related to Tesla‚Äôs (lack of) low carbon strategy and codes of business conduct,‚Äù added Dorn.
Furthermore, other factors such as reports of racial discrimination and inadequate working conditions at Tesla‚Äôs plant in Fremont, as well as the way the carmaker dealt with the NHTSA investigation after numerous deaths and injuries were linked to its autopilot cars, also contributed to the decline in Tesla‚Äôs S&amp;P DJI ESG Score.

"How to play extremely high-risk FDs with 1000% upside. With $JNJ and $AAPL as examples.Since [my last thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8azo6j/if_you_bought_into_my_options_plays_thread/), I've been getting a lot of messages from people wanting more trade ideas. I promised another thread last week but ended up forgetting. I had a lot of fun writing this up last night while drinking beer and watching the Harry Potter movies. This took two entire Harry Potter movies to write. Prisoner of Azkaban is the best one.

Since you all love throwing your money away, I'll share how I play FDs. I cannot understate the risk involved here. I try to minimize risk by proactively closing out of an FD early if, for example, volume action in the morning is low (whether or not it opens green). I take into account many other things, which I won't go over in this thread, but just remember that nothing in this thread is even remotely close to being safe. If you're serious about following my advice here, please read the entire thread.

I only pursue FDs if there exists a realistic and reasonable scenario in which hitting a 1000% profit is not simply grasping at straws. I'll elaborate on this later. The title is not clickbait. It's possible to hit a 1000% banger over the course of a week with this strategy so long as you can stomach the losses you *will* come across. *A lot* of things need to happen for me to take the risk and open a play like this, and even more things need to go right -- with the correct timing -- to turn a profit. To show you what I mean, I'll share two example plays for this coming week. Do note that **the timing for these plays may have already passed**. Depending on what happens come Monday morning, if the following tickers open green and don't go back down enough for call prices to depress, it may be too late to get in on the 1000% action. 

In my opinion, these plays are simply not worth it if there isn't a realistic potential for 1000% gains because you will undoubtedly lose money on most of them. So you need big hits to justify the losses. If you're only looking at a 500% gain come Monday morning, assuming these tickers open green, proceed at your own peril. I personally don't mess with FDs if I'm only looking at a realistic upside of 500%.

**Johnson and Johnson ($JNJ)**
-

I haven't bought into this play yet because I was at work and forgot. I learned the hard way with PTLA that sharing plays early with you lot, before I've bought into them, can bite me in the ass. After I shared my play, call prices for PTLA went up and never dropped back down again afterwards, even though the share price went down... Regardless, JNJ will serve as a good example, and if Monday is red, there may be an opportunity to buy in. 

So, why a long-term company like JNJ specifically? This past week has been rough on JNJ. The company announced average earnings, which the market really didn't like because I honestly have no idea. There were some other tidbits of news surrounding JNJ recently, but I personally thought JNJ's results were fine. Not great, but still fine. Even before this report, JNJ got beat up a lot and share price had stagnated to where it was at almost a full year ago. I didn't have a stake in it, but I thought JNJ would go up with not-bad news. Not down. JNJ is near its 52-week low and is still a great company, with a great dividend, in a great market.

Thus sets the scene for a high-risk, 1000% banger. Great.

-

**READ THE FOLLOWING POINTS CAREFULLY.** They outline the kind of thought process I go through to justify playing FDs. There are different justifications for different companies and scenarios. Hopefully, with enough examples, you'll begin to see things through my gambling-tinted glasses. These points are listed in order of decreasing importance. 

1. JNJ earnings have passed, so options no longer carry high IV. 

2. JNJ is a historically safe growth company (for a biotech), and options are priced to reflect this usual stability. This is basically the Disney of pharmaceuticals, and like Disney, JNJ is very safe. We're banking on some unexpected volatility. 

3. Other major companies are announcing earnings next week, which, if positive, could lead to a huge reversal in the market. Google reports Monday. This is a double-edged sword because if Google shits the bed Monday, it's all over. 

4. There is no JNJ-specific news coming next week, other than a dividend increase announcement. This also greatly reduces IV. 

5. This is where the reasoning becomes less compelling, yet relevant enough to mention. JNJ's average dividend yield is ~2.75% over the past 5 years. JNJ is going to announce a dividend increase this coming week. I'm predicting an increase to 90 cents per quarter because that's more aesthetic than the expected 88 cents per quarter. I do actually believe, unironically, that JNJ will choose 90 cents over 88 cents because it's a better looking number (also tax cuts), so take that for what you will. Anyway, at 90 cents per quarter, JNJ's yield comes out to 2.84% from Friday's close, which is high for a reliable company that grows consistently and is sought after for its dividends. If we go by 90 cents at an average yield of 2.75%, we arrive at a fair share value of ~$131.

6. Open interest in puts and calls is pretty flat, all things considered. Nothing stands out, so that means big players aren't really in on this one way or the other. Sometimes this can be a factor, and sometimes not.

-

And now onto the actual play.

* **JNJ April 27th 131.00 calls**

These are worth 12 cents per contract, going by Friday's closing bid-ask spread. If JNJ goes up to $131 before Wednesday noon, an increase of 3.43%, these calls will **profit ~1000%**. 

If this move happens very early in the day Monday or Tuesday, the profit will be higher. And when I say ""Wednesday noon"", I don't actually mean right at Wednesday noon. What I really mean is early enough during the day on Wednesday so that the options are priced for a larger potential increase. If the target price of $131 is hit Wednesday at closing or Thursday open, these calls will profit less. 

These estimates are going to be off because we're dealing with moves that are far-fetched. Greeks will only get you so far when you're trying to predict moves on stuff like this because even the smallest of things -- like what *time* of day share price moves, with what kind of volume, on what kind of news, how volatile the market expects to be, etc, etc -- can affect option pricing and thus the final estimates. But, in general, I'm not wrong often.

By the way, if share price gaps down the next day, you're down at least 50%. Even a decrease of 0.5% in underlying share price at open is a death wish.

**Apple ($AAPL)**
-

I personally dislike Apple and its products, but the potential for a 1000% banger was too compelling, so I bought $3000 worth of FDs near Friday closing. I'll get right into the play and reasoning because you probably already know why Apple went down this past week. 

* **AAPL April 27th 172.50 calls**

These calls are worth roughly 55 cents each (I got them at 57 cents). If share price goes up to $172 or so, which is a bit less than where it was at Thursday closing, these calls will **profit ~500%**. If share price goes back up to around $178, which is around where it was at Wednesday closing, these calls will be deeply ITM and **profit ~1000%** regardless of what day of the week it is. Earlier in the week is still better and will yield a greater profit. The 500% profit scenario relies on a move early on in the week. 

Reasoning in decreasing significance: 

1. Apple's earnings report is not this coming week, but the following week on May 1st. This means these calls do not carry high IV. They still have some pretty high IV, but not earnings report kind of high IV. 

2. Other tech giants are reporting next week, with Google reporting *Monday*. This is absolutely huge, and the timing makes this play enticing as hell. A big run-up Tuesday morning following good news with Google means that these calls could go back to the 170-180 level. We have a chance to effectively play an Apple earnings report without buying into the IV of an actual earnings report. When Google shoots up during an earnings report, so too does Apple (usually... kind of...). This isn't only because they're both tech companies, but it plays a big role. This is a heavier connection than the JNJ-Google one mentioned above. 

3. Merrill Lynch is literal trash. 

4. Again, this is much less compelling, but still relevant enough to put in here. There isn't a lot of open interest for calls at this expiration date. Open interest is relatively low for every price until you get to $175 strike. There is however a lot of open interest for puts ranging from OTM puts to ITM puts up to $175 strike. So I believe that big money sold a ton of puts, but not a lot of calls, because they expect a move up to a little less than $175/share. Big money players may try to pin share price at around $175 so calls at this strike price don't go ITM. They then get to rake in them premiums from both ends of the stick. 

5. With the tax cuts and Apple's big win regarding cash repatriation, I expect Tim Cook to swoop in and save the day next week with huge buybacks. We already know Apple and other companies (assuming they're good at timing buybacks) love to buy back shares when sentiment is low and share price has taken a slump. I think that these buybacks will spark a big rally when coupled with good earnings.

-

As always, risk is very high and you know the drill by now. A bad report by Google means there's a good chance both of these plays fall flat. If everything doesn't go exactly as planned, these plays will fall flat. Keep that in mind before you think about following along the 1000% road. ",0

"4-19-22 SPY, APPLE, QQQ Daily TA  

Well that was the most boring bullish 1.61% day I have ever seen. SHEESH.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6ljb5843ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30a1e5009996fa7bbc564645ec2ffc7c75315ff2

As you can see the bulls this morning came out absolutely swinging and managed to take SPY from opening price of 437.86 all the way to 444.3 by 11am. Most of the upward bull swing was made within the first 45 minutes of the day though with some impressively large green candles. 

As you can see we closed ABOVE and well ABOVE the red bear channel. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xcsh3xt43ku81.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b345fa48e77df7e86869db0613be60f979aa6c

So yep you guessed it‚Ä¶ SPY OFFICIALLY broke the bear channel started back on March 29th. BUT we have NOT made a new higher high until SPY  breaks that large black dotted like at 450. Once SPY breaks 450 I will officially call this a bull run. Until then we could be forming a wider bear channel. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iw2qdxb53ku81.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=471f6939e5131df16c424c56bd97408bf9d65fb1

Which looks something like this! 

This much wider bear channel gives us a resistance as I mentioned at 450 and a new support at 432. Now the one issue here is that Netflix just got absolutely obliterated on its earnings again (down 26% as im writing this). With Netflix posting a massive hit like that I worry that the markets are going to over react and take a hit here to price in terrible earnings. We have Tesla earnings after hours tomorrow and that will be the true test of what is going to happen with the markets this earnings season in my opinion. However, it would be naive not to expect a retrace tomorrow with this Netflix hit as we see right now -0.44% currently. Definitely will be something to watch intraday tomorrow. 442.7 provided heavy support today so that is definitely a level we need to keep an eye on tomorrow. As long as spy holds that (bounced off it after hours) I believe we will see green tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pf0coi063ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a97057111bcce4b3e507b4e6554e79d929a1510d

SPY daily chart we are still in the bear channel as I mentioned until we see 450 tomorrow (if it comes). Right now the main take aways for the day was that the bulls managed to close Spy ABOVE the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema today after opening below all the EMAs. That is a VERY bullish finish today and will in my opinion set the tone for the rest of the week and next. The only bearish take away I have from today is that bulls were not able to close above the daily 100ema of 446.04. However, this close here gives us a easy spot to close above the daily 100ema tomorrow. The daily 8ema of 442.7 (at the time) provided support almost all day today and that is something I will look for to continue tomorrow with the 8ema closing at 442.91. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f6eeqj63ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8701d9b4131fb199290bfdf86b8d30be77cf6fd

Apple had a bullish day today also but actually failed to break its bear channel on the 15min chart. This channel has a resistance of 168 tomorrow and support of 160.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xsd4pu673ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d525b6936b700ef73774b51c580f140de41bea97

Despite Apples green day it actually looks more bearish than SPY today. Apple failed to break its daily 8/ 50ema at 168.27 today. That is actually fairly bearish, however, bulls could argue Apple closed above the 100ema after trading below it for 3 days and now has an opportunity tomorrow to close above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100ema. The goal for bulls tomorrow will be to close above 170. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/npvf60r73ku81.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c594662927394de8e92430af721c2d7aef84ad3

QQQ of apple and SPY is the one I recommend going long on here, knowing it COULD see a small drop if earnings really are bad these next two weeks. I had my girl load up on QQQ today as I find it to be a great buying spot for it. QQQ is roughly 19% of its highs still and to me offers the most upside potential. 

QQQ as you can see broke their bear channel today. QQQ also was able to close ABOVE its daily 8ema of 345.35 today which is the first time if almost two weeks. The daily 20 (348.85), 50 (351.93), 200 (357.18) and 100 (358.06) are all now well within the grasps of QQQ if you can close above it. You can also see QQQ managed to hold a crucial support of 338. I mentioned the possible head and shoulders formed that would shoot QQQ back to 375-380 in the next few weeks. If bears are in control tomorrow they will attempt to close back below the daily 8ema again and also break it back near that 338 support line. 

Overall we are entering earnings season and now is a risky time to be holding ANYTHING over night. 

&amp;#x200B;

Realistically besides Tesla tomorrow and SNAP on Thursday there isn‚Äôt any truly market moving (not that SNAP is) earnings to write home about. 

10% challenge-

Today was quite the day for me as I was able to make about 2.5x my daily profit goal today. I have officially secure my weekly profit goal already which is crucial since I wont get to trade Friday. I will look to continue to play conservative the rest of the week. The change to 3dte and a small position size so far has been great and successful. Below are listed my plays of the day.

With the bull run today I was also able to roll my MES puts one time this morning and then end of day closed 2 for 50% and 1 for 30% profits. I did expect a small pull back which we got. I will at 6pm when futures reopen look to sell 3 more puts here.

The candlestick on the daily chart shows a doji which signals indecision. An indecisive candle on its own won't tell you much, but at the 275 range it tells you a lot. We're still around the 200MA and there should be way more buyers than sellers at a support level but it's about equal as I'm typing this. This shows the bears strength or the bulls weakness. Either way, if I had to pick a side I'd pick the short side. There's definitely a chance we go up tomorrow but I think there's a higher chance we remain flat or go down tomorrow.

"DD on AMD and why I Believe it is UndervaluedGraphics cards are in extremely high demand right and AMD is one of the only companies with the ability to provide that commodity. I understand there are other companies producing the same product, but AMD has the highest rate of innovation among all of the graphics card companies. On top of that, AMD announced they are releasing a new line of graphics cards and Biden recently addressed the semiconductor shortage that is prevent this product from being made. Once AMD is able to pick production back up, sales will go through the roof. There is so much demand for their product it is insane. Normally graphics cards sell for ~$400, but currently they are selling aftermarket for $1,200+ which truly proves the demand for their product. For all of these reasons, I am very bullish on AMD and plan to scale up my investment size as time goes on. 

TLDR: AMD has a product in high demand and is trading at a discount right now.

"Google, the oversold cash cow üêÑ that will blow past earnings...moooGoogle is a cash cow.  

It has complete control of the market in search that it will not lose.

It has dominance or little competition in so many markets: Android OS, Web browsing (Chrome), Video streaming (YouTube), Google Maps, Smart Home technology.

It has Google Cloud whose growth has accelerated faster than AWS and MSFT Allure.

It has more information about you, than you can even remember.

Google has so much reliance on it's monopolistic software that it can do so much with the extra money it generates.  

It is not at the risk of not being at the technology forefront by focusing on hardware.

It has Business Workspace for enterprise.

Google is everywhere.

It has so many integrated revenue streams, easy control of pricing over those revenue streams and can target users with how much information it has.




Google consistently beats earnings.

It consistently maintains enormous margins.

It consistently increases revenue and FCF, tripling in 3 yrs since 2018.

Google only has 150k employees (compare to Amazon 1.6 million).

It is growing, safe, essentially has monopolies, low operating costs that are easily controllable and control of revenue.  It can invest all that money in whatever it wants.

This is seriously one of the best companies ever.  It is ALWAYS a long term hold.  




During this tech implosion, Google share price has suffered.  Netflix made it sink even more.  It is now oversold.

But, it will beat earnings like always and it's price will jump.


I bought 2220 Put expiring 4/29 on Wednesday as a hedge against my shares.  I will now be selling Monday and going to buy calls for some nice gains after earnings.


Thank you Netflix for dragging Google down so much more than it should.",1

"Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and holdEvery other comment right now is a shill lamenting the stupidity of everyone who‚Äôs still holding or how sad it is the big guy won again or some other gloomy horseshit. 

To all of you who are out there who‚Äôve ever thought ‚Äúoh man, if I‚Äôd only bought X stock X years ago I‚Äôd be rich!‚Äù - if you aren‚Äôt holding right now, you‚Äôre wrong. 

I‚Äôm an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn‚Äôt sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I‚Äôm holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it‚Äôs too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin‚Äôs mistake? No actual hedging. Don‚Äôt be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won‚Äôt help if you‚Äôre making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I‚Äôve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don‚Äôt give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren‚Äôt the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It‚Äôs not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we‚Äôre in dire straits probably didn‚Äôt comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold. Do you want to be the ‚ÄúGolly I could‚Äôve had Apple 20 years ago!‚Äù guy for the rest of your life, or do you wanna be the strong motherfucker who actually took the leap?",0

The candlestick on the daily chart shows a doji which signals indecision. An indecisive candle on its own won't tell you much, but at the 275 range it tells you a lot. We're still around the 200MA and there should be way more buyers than sellers at a support level but it's about equal as I'm typing this. This shows the bears strength or the bulls weakness. Either way, if I had to pick a side I'd pick the short side. There's definitely a chance we go up tomorrow but I think there's a higher chance we remain flat or go down tomorrow. All about playing the probabilities. Tbh, I would sit today out and wait for tomorrow. But I bought 6/5 puts.

i wouldn't actually call this year a major crisis at least for now.

"AAPL FD's in season? ""big announcement"" that is bigger and better than a productSee the end of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbnbC3DNbQw
 - [Here's the Twitter post where this info came from](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1349022083393708037.html)
 - [And the comments on the Apple subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/kvukih/cbs_apple_has_a_big_announcement_tomorrow_that/)

Summarized for you autists:

 - Gayle King went to an Apple store to conduct her (remote) interview with Tim Cook. She could have done the interview from anywhere.
 - Suggests whatever it is, it's at the apple store (not a product)
 - A morning show interview implies Apple's announcement will come out pretty early in the day (if not later today).
 - Also implies Apple thinks its non-product news will have impact / relevancy with the mass market.
 - Also, Gayle King is a big hitter for CBS. Doubtful this will be a ""we now offer Apple Card Monthly Installments for Apple Watch bands"" type of thing.
 - An ""Apple Stores as vaccination sites"" announcement makes sense to me.
 - Other people think it could be related to privacy (/u/XtremePhotoDesign: ""CES is taking place this week. Apple has used CES week to tout iOS privacy in the past. This is certainly an announcement related to iOS 14 privacy controls."")

From the Reddit post comments (/u/jturp-sc):

 - They're going to use Apple stores for vaccine distribution.
 - They're announcing some industry partnership (e.g. automotive joint venture) that will lead to future product(s). (my note: why would they have to do this at the store? Still my favorite idea)
 - The search engine is launching and somehow they don't consider it a ""product"" because it's free to use.
 - Donating an eye-watering amount of hardware to educational institutions to help with virtual school.

Now, in true autist fashion I haven't been following this stock for shit. Personally I'd just throw everything into AAPL or GOEV weeklikes, or, for the weak people, GOEVW",1
"New FBI documents link Saudi spy in California to 9/11 attacks - Mike Kelly   
Get your calls and puts ready, falks - OIL IS GOING TO THE MOON! FREEDOM COMES TO SAUDITS!

Soon after the 9/11 attacks two decades ago, the FBI quietly launched an investigation into a seemingly obscure Saudi Arabian government bureaucrat in Southern California.

The man claimed to be nothing more than a Saudi aviation official who innocently happened to befriend two Islamic jihadists in the months before they carried out the 9/11 attacks.¬†

That story now appears to be false. The alleged aviation official was really a Saudi spy who reported directly to a Saudi prince who happened to be the kingdom‚Äôs influential ambassador in Washington and a close friend of President George W. Bush and other top U.S. government officials. ¬†

The FBI concluded five years ago that there was a ""50/50 chance"" that this Saudi spy knew ahead of time that the two Islamists¬†he befriended were about to join the plot to hijack¬†commercial jetliners and crash them into buildings in what turned out to be America's deadliest terrorist attack.¬†But the FBI refused to go public with its findings ‚Äî until now.¬†

 **While heavily redacted, the report offers the most direct link yet between the Saudi government, its secretive royal family and the team of 19 operatives of Osama bin Laden‚Äôs al-Qaeda terror network who hijacked four jetliners on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. The terrorists crashed two jetliners into New York‚Äôs World Trade Center, another into the Pentagon in Northern Virginia and a fourth, which was reportedly headed to the U.S. Capitol, into a farm field in Pennsylvania.**¬†

Taking a look at SPY daily we got a really nice head and shoulders pattern forming. I mentioned that big run up we just had looked a lot like October 3rd and 4th. If that is true (which I do believe) then today was October 6th and we should push down from here. 

I am looking for a retest by next week of 356-360 support. If that support breaks then we could be looking for a new 52 week low. 

Keep in mind that next week is the week before FOMC meeting and generally speaking 5 out of the last 6 weeks before FOMC have been red averaging a -3% to -5% drop. 

Key support- 364 -&gt; 360 -&gt; 356.5

Key resistance- 368.2 -&gt; 371.1

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7jjbx8knr0v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d824b7a75efa1107088aab23d83c044f78063d92

Futures lost that key 3680 support I was talking about and looks to be closing back under it and under the daily 8ema just like SPY did today. With the loss of 3680 I suspect a retest of that key 3590 support area. 

Key support- 3590 -&gt; 3500

Key resistance- 3710 -&gt; 3760 -&gt; 3805

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oq4eu59or0v91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc6853b2599531bfdccea7354cb6f0f9f7e27de0

I am bearish on apple, however, I would like to see it lose and close under its daily 8ema, however it did hard reject the daily 20ema today again. Apple put in a really massive gravestone doji today just like Spy did. This candle should be a reversal candle and should lead to a downside test. I do expect a test of at least 138.2 by end of next week. 

Key support -141.7 -&gt; 138.2

Tesla has been on an absolute wild sell off for the last month with no end in sight. We found support at that 205 range today bouncing off of it twice today. I was actually a little impressed to see Tesla bounce how it did this morning as I really thought we might just breach through 200 today. However it looks like after putting a new 52 week low in today that we will have to wait and see where it goes. Overall I am bearish on Tesla and I am looking for 170-180 by end of next week also. 

Support- 205 -&gt; 195.9 -&gt; 176.3

Resistance- 215.2 -&gt; 223.3

Honestly the VIX is telling a mixed story here. It doesn‚Äôt quite want to sell off, however it doesn‚Äôt quite want to rip up either. Today we saw spy close almost -1% and yet the VIX actually unwound slightly. 

I am still holding bearish until that key 28.4 level is broken. 

10% challenge-

Today was a great day for me. Played a few tesla plays too and closed a few swings I had been holding and averaged down. 

I am bearish for the next week leading into FOMC November 2nd.

Intel tried to bribe VU University Amsterdam into suppressing news of the latest security flaw

Intel is reverting to the illegal behaviors that they were found guilty of in many jurisdictions worldwide during the 2003 to 2007 period.

The following is a Google translation of a Dutch report about VU University Amsterdam's announcement of this latest (among many) of Intel security leaks that have compromised the security and performance of their customers. The performance impact alone can, according to Intel, be as high as 9%, and this leaps up to nearly 50% if you also (as many recommend) turn off hyperthreading. The article is long, but well worth a read. I've bolded the following two excerpts from the full text:

**According to the VU, Intel tried to downplay the severity of the leak by officially paying $40,000 in reward and ""$80,000"" in addition. That offer was politely refused.**

**""If it were up to Intel, they would have wanted to wait another six months""**

Source here: [https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/05/14/hackers-mikken-op-het-intel-hart-a3960208](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/05/14/hackers-mikken-op-het-intel-hart-a3960208)

Translation from Dutch to English:

# VU discovers megaleak in Intel chips

Thanks to a mistake, the VU uncovered a mega breach in Intel chips. Intel pays the price for a fast but risky design.

The news in brief:

* **Researchers from the VU University Amsterdam have found an extensive data breach that is present in all Intel processors. These chips are in more than 80 percent of all computers and servers.**
* **On Tuesday evening, Intel and VU announced the details of RIDL (Rogue In-Flight Data Load), a vulnerability that allows malicious parties to ""steal almost all data"" from computers. Unauthorized persons can view the data that the processor is currently processing.**
* **The vulnerability is in all Intel processors of the last ten years - including the very latest. Hackers can exploit the vulnerability by hiding code in a web advertisement.**

Two rack cabinets from the Ikea full of computer walls, a jumble of cables and a stack of second-hand processors. It is not immediately the test lab that you expect from which VU University researchers uncovered the sophisticated, super-complex leak in recent months.

Here, in room P455, on the fourth floor of the W&amp;N building in Amsterdam, it was demonstrated that all Intel processors of the past ten years are susceptible to a major leak. This means that more than 80 percent of all computers in the world are susceptible to an attack that gives access to data at the heart of the computer.

RIDL, as the new vulnerability was baptized, came to light by chance. On Tuesday 11 September, Stephan van Schaijk, Computer Science student at VU University Amsterdam, worked on his study assignment: investigating a leak in the Intel processor.

Van Schaijk: ‚ÄûI was busy for an hour but did not advance. I adjusted something in my code and then I saw something strange appear on the screen. Values ‚Äã‚ÄãI did not expect. ""

Van Schaijk had made a mistake, a bug in a bug, with which he could suddenly watch what happened in another program. It was a bigger and more serious leak than he was actually looking for.

His colleagues and teachers were just as surprised. Together, they wrote more than 20 ""exploits"" attack scenarios in a short time that would allow hackers to take control of the computer.

One of those tricks: by logging in with an incorrect password, the attacker forces the computer to compare the wrong password with the correct password. This data runs through the 'pipelines' of the chip and can be intercepted, after which the hacker can retrieve the correct password after some tinkering. ""You find fragments. As if you are going to get a paper document through the shredder and then reassemble the shreds, ‚Äùsays Herbert Bos, professor of system and network security at the VU.

Stephan van Schaijk was sent out to buy as many different processors as possible, to see if they were all vulnerable.

And that was true. Even the oldest one, from 2008, that was picked up via Marktplaats, turned out to be vulnerable to RIDL, or Rogue In-Flight Data Load. And so, Intel was immediately warned.

A beer please

It is not the first time that Intel gets into trouble with a leak in its processors. The chip is extra fast because it is ahead of things: each time the processor speculates which data is probably needed next. This presents risks because computer processes do not remain well separated from each other.

Assistant professor Kaveh Razavi compares it to a caf√©: the processor works like a waitress who assumes that you want to drink the same as the one before you. The glass is poured automatically without the waitress checking whether you can have that beer.

The solution: the tray must be emptied after every order. That makes the processor slower. Depending on the programs you use, the speed difference can be considerable, the researchers expect. That explains why Intel has been struggling so long to fix this leak.

RIDL cuts right through all existing security layers. This applies to the data centers where virtual systems often run on the same server. The encrypted environment that Intel devised for business customers is also vulnerable.

Premium with aftertaste

Although parts of the leak were found by several researchers from different universities and companies, the VU has discovered the majority. Amsterdam University is also the only party to receive a reward: $100,000 (89,000 euros), Intel's maximum reward for discoverers of critical leaks.

There is a small taste to the premium. **According to the VU, Intel tried to downplay the severity of the leak by officially paying $40,000 in reward and ""$80,000"" in addition. That offer was politely refused.**

Anyone who accepts a reward must also adhere to the rules. In this case, that meant: no consultation between researchers and uncertainty about which software manufacturers were warned in advance. According to the researchers, tech companies do not reason in the interests of the user, but of the shareholder.

Intel initially failed to notify Google and Mozilla, two major browser manufacturers.

The VU tried to force the manufacturer to come out faster. Eventually the VU forced Intel to come out in May - otherwise the university would publish the details itself. ""**If it were up to Intel, they would have wanted to wait another six months**,"" says Bos.

Intel had promised that the next generation of chips would not be vulnerable to RIDL, but that is not the case.

Hackers usually anticipate software vulnerabilities. Undiscovered holes (zero days) in important programs are sold for a lot of money in the black circuit. But after Specter and Meltdown, two fundamental holes that were previously found in Intel chips, both the ethical computer experts and the criminal figures are pointing their hardware. ""Processors have become so complex that chip makers no longer have security under control,"" said Bos.

And what should you do as a computer user? Update, update and update again. It is expected that all major software manufacturers will close the gap or have already closed the latest releases. It's not for nothing that RIDL comes out on Patch Tuesday, the monthly update day from Microsoft.

These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction.

"AAPL 230.00 Call June 2021 $19Hi all,

I am planning on getting 10 contracts (about 40K) for Apple 230 June 2021 call at 19 or so. My reasoning for optimism is the Apple Card. 

I travel for business within the US. For the last few weeks, I have been noticing how many people use iPhone vs other devices. Almost every state I visited more people use iPhone and only half of them half Apple Watch (growth potential). 

Here is where the card comes in. They already have the customer base using their devices. I am sure they will make it easier or enticing to get the card.

One of the key aspect of the card is that Apple can use that data to market better services. (Part of the agreement of the card). That means competing with companies like yelp etc - based on your spending habits Apple can target advertise - you are where you spend your money, great marketing. 

Of course the other business growth can be tied to these services. Apple is spending over 4 billion in R&amp;D. Something big would have to come out of that.

Well as I mentioned yesterday if we hit that 431.8 area and hard reject that you were about to be served the worlds greatest put opportunity. And boy was it an opportunity! I was unfortunately picking the kiddos up and missed it myself but wow talk about a hard reject! 

https://preview.redd.it/86c67lipd5i91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffde228133d98d7f234668edadf21769197e3163

Well we are quickly eliminating resistance and support lines from the mix. Today we broke below that black dotted support line and we perfectly rejected the red solid rising wedge resistance AND the bear market resistance line while managing to close at the daily level resistance. Lots of resistance here huh? 

Tomorrow is where things will get interesting. 

Key support tomorrow-

427.2 -&gt; 424.8 -&gt; 423.5 (9 week bull support) 

Key resistance tomorrow-

429.8 (daily resistance level) -&gt; 431.4 (bear market resistance) -&gt; 434 (red rising wedge resistance)

Overall watching how we reacted here and the fact that we have no had 5 green days in a row (technically one of them was 0.00% but still 5 in a row green) I have a feeling tomorrow we are going to see a red day and test some supports down below. 

We have FOMC minutes tomorrow and while that does not always mean a red or green day usually from 2pm to 3pm we see a fairly big green move when the news it released. I posted to the server my game plane and will update my game plan tomorrow with the premarket post. 

I most likely will be looking for a back test of support down near 427.2 and potentially 424.8 if there seems to be a pretty big overnight or morning drop. 

https://preview.redd.it/lfw265dqd5i91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0df906daf2e296f98ca43e59ce764770471d37d4

Futures daily looks a little different in that we broke through the blue resistance line of the rising wedge and we broke through support of it. However, today we did not see the bulls test the ES futures bear market resistance. We are seeing more of a doji daily candle finish for futures though compared to SPYs candle.

Resistance-

4330 -&gt; 4352

Support-

4300 -&gt; 4277

https://preview.redd.it/nclnzexqd5i91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=201e90049542e107f1f5cd4f9bb580871d2235ec

SPY weekly you can see we rejected the weekly resistance level of 431.7 very nicely today and the black dotted resistance line, however, failed to reach out and touch the actual weekly bear market resistance closer to 432.7.

Futures is about the same looking but we failed to touch the black dotted rising wedge and the bear market level. However, futures weekly is setting up more like a doji candle at this moment.

Apple and tech in general today showed the most weakness of the whole market. With apple finishing red and SPY green. Most of the morning Apple showed a great deal of weakness. 

Currently we are seeing a double top with a doji which could signal a small pullback is warranted tomorrow. We are also seeing that 6 day long black solid rising wedge support broken through now. 

Key support-

172.1 -&gt; 171 (red dotted rising wedge)

Key resistance-

173.3 -&gt; 174 -&gt; 174.5 (bear market resistance)

Apples weekly is actually setting up for a possible top of this run candle with a current hammer candle developing. Key weekly resistance is 174.5

The VIX continues to stay put around this 19.7 level refusing to break lower or higher. We are finally starting to see some consolidation and sideways movement on the VIX much like we did with the March top. 

10% challenge-

Overall great day for me. Played a nice call and a nice put scalp today. Missed the massive dump from 431.8 while getting the kiddos but overall great day and great week so far. 

Tomorrows FOMC minutes which also brings a great opportunity that I look forward to for sure.

Notes:

* We did see some upside but it came later in the day.
* We couldn‚Äôt overcome the March 3rd high anchored vwap. It‚Äôs currently at 426.56 so that‚Äôs also something to keep an eye on. The bulls need to overcome this VWAP and the 200 EMA for a decent move upwards IMO.
* We closed under the 21 EMA (15 min) and the 200 EMA (15 min.)
   * 21 EMA currently sits at 417.08
   * 200 EMA currently sits at 428.21
* Daily RSI - bearish. 65 min RSI - bearish. 15 min. RSI - bearish. I‚Äôm anticipating a temporary bounce at this level right here on the daily RSI but we shall see. Lose this level, expect a backtest in the days to come. However, we did break through this level.

"Weekly Risk Ranges for TSLA, AAPL, SPY, QQQ, IWM, GOOG, MSFT, AMZNIf this looks foreign to you, let me explain how I go about getting this. I first go to the options chain for the ticker and then I look at the options expiring next week at the money. I take the Ask on both the call and put side and add them together. This is my expected move from the current stock price. I then add and subtract the expected move from the stock price to come up with the higher and lower risk ranges. These ranges basically tell you if we're overbought or oversold. If we hit these risk ranges early in the week, it could make for a good trade in the opposite direction. Often times, major macro events can cause us to significantly fall above or below these expectations so do use with caution when approaching major macro news.

"Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and holdEvery other comment right now is a shill lamenting the stupidity of everyone who‚Äôs still holding or how sad it is the big guy won again or some other gloomy horseshit. 

To all of you who are out there who‚Äôve ever thought ‚Äúoh man, if I‚Äôd only bought X stock X years ago I‚Äôd be rich!‚Äù - if you aren‚Äôt holding right now, you‚Äôre wrong. 

I‚Äôm an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn‚Äôt sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I‚Äôm holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it‚Äôs too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin‚Äôs mistake? No actual hedging. Don‚Äôt be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won‚Äôt help if you‚Äôre making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I‚Äôve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don‚Äôt give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren‚Äôt the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It‚Äôs not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we‚Äôre in dire straits probably didn‚Äôt comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold.

"5/15 SPY 300C: Goodnight, sweet prince.We are gathered here today to mourn the loss of 5/15 SPY 300 calls.  As a call holder, I have the honor to speak here on behalf of my many bag-holding brothers and sisters. 

As we stand here we mourn the loss of fantasies. Fantasies of a profitable trade, a profitable portfolio, paying rent, and even starting a family. They were calls we respected and calls that respected us. Anyone who held SPY 300 calls believed them to be generous; a considered investment with low theta and high gamma. It was these qualities that made us buy them. It was these qualities that made us hold them to OTM expiration. 

Today I want everyone to celebrate, to remember and think about these calls that we loved. To tell stories of autism and to laugh, and to remember the emotions that go with the stories because I think SPY 300C would be happy to know we were laughing and telling stories of our disabilities.

Every moment that I shared with the calls have become that much more special today. The calls were more than a good play -- they were a great play. Today is my chance to say thank you for brightening my portfolio. You were a gift from the option writer to me, and now you are a gift from me to the option writer.

2. Margin requirements to sell naked options?

- I think it depends on broker, underlying stock, strike, date, IV, and other stuff. July 19 $195/275 short strangle for $10.53 credit is showing $2.2k buying power reduction for me. Meanwhile a short straddle at $230 for $36.38 credit is showing $4.6k BPR.

"Why you should buy GOOGL puts and YOLO into Reddit IPO 

Reddit is currently the most popular search engine. The only people who don‚Äôt know that are the team at Reddit, who can‚Äôt be bothered to build a decent search interface. So instead we resort to using Google, and appending the word ‚Äúreddit‚Äù to the end of our queries.

Paul Graham thinks this image means Reddit as a social media site ‚Äústill hasn‚Äôt peaked‚Äù. What it actually means is that the amount of people using Reddit as a search engine is growing.

üì∑

Why are people searching Reddit specifically? The short answer is that Google search results are clearly dying. The long answer is that most of the web has become too inauthentic to trust.

## How do we know Google is dying?

If you‚Äôve tried to search for a recipe or product review recently, I don‚Äôt need to tell you that Google search results have gone to shit. You would have already noticed that the first few non-ad results are SEO optimized sites filled with affiliate links and ads.

Google still gives decent results for many other categories, especially when it comes to factual information. You might think that Google results are pretty good for you, and you have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about.

What you don‚Äôt realize is that you‚Äôve been self-censoring yourself from searching most of the things you would have wanted to search. You already know subconsciously that Google isn‚Äôt going to return a good result.

I‚Äôm far from the only one who thinks Google is dying:

[Daniel Gross](https://dcgross.com/a-new-google)

&gt;In 2000, Google got popular because hackers realized it was better than Lycos or Excite. This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren‚Äôt using Google anymore.

[Ask HN: Has Google search become quantitatively worse?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29392702)

&gt;The results keep getting ""refined"" so as to suit the popular 80% of queries, while getting much worse for any technical or obscure queries. Forced synonyms and ""people also searched for"" are typically useless and almost infuriating. Once you get off the first or second page, the results get even worse-- with pages entirely unrelated to the query (e.g. not even containing the searched phrases). They are probably testing/already implemented some sort of multi armed bandit type optimization like on Youtube's search results where they just show any popular pages (ignoring relevancy) to see if they yield a click.

[Michael Seibel](https://twitter.com/mwseibel/status/1477701120319361026):

&gt;A recent small medical issue has highlighted how much someone needs to disrupt Google Search. Google is no longer producing high quality search results in a significant number of important categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;Health, product reviews, recipes are three categories I searched today where top results featured clickbait sites riddled with crappy ads. I‚Äôm sure there are many more.

[Paul Graham](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1477760548787920901)

&gt;This may not just be a problem with Google but possibly also the recipe for beating Google. A startup usually has to start with a niche market. Why not try writing a search engine specifically for some category dominated by SEO spam?

## Why is Google dying?

### Ads

It is obvious that serving ads creates misaligned incentives for search engines. The founders of Google pointed this out themselves when they were just getting started.

[Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page (1998)](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html)

&gt;‚ÄúCurrently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users‚Ä¶we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers‚Ä¶Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.‚Äù

Unfortunately, these thoughts on the failings of ad-based search engines read like an instruction manual for what Google did next.

They‚Äôve dialed it up to the max recently to squeeze out every last cent before their inevitable collapse.

üì∑

### SEO

There are tons of people whose sole job is to game their way to the top of Google, so it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising when search results deteriorate in quality. To be fair, this would probably be an issue with any search engine, but you‚Äôd expect Google to be able to come up with a less gameable algorithm.

Here‚Äôs a [fun story](https://alexskra.com/blog/the-mermaid-is-taking-over-google-search-in-norway/) about how one website gamed their way to the top of Google in Norway.

### AI

Google increasingly does not give you the results for what you typed in. It tries to be ‚Äúsmart‚Äù and figure out what you ‚Äúreally meant‚Äù, in addition to personalizing things for you. If you really meant exactly what you typed, then all bets are off.

Even the exact match query operator (‚Äú ‚Äù) [doesn‚Äôt give exact matches anymore](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27052634), which is quite bizarre.

## Why are people appending ‚Äúreddit‚Äù to their queries?

There‚Äôs a fun conspiracy theory that popped up recently called the [Dead Internet Theory](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/). The claim is basically that most of the internet is bots. There aren‚Äôt real people here anymore.

[IlluminatiPirate](https://forum.agoraroad.com/index.php?threads/dead-internet-theory-most-of-the-internet-is-fake.3011/):

&gt;TLDR: Large proportions of the supposedly human-produced content on the internet are actually generated by artificial intelligence networks in conjunction with paid secret media influencers in order to manufacture consumers for an increasing range of newly-normalised cultural products.

This isn‚Äôt true (yet), but it reflects some general sense that the authentic web is gone. The SEO marketers gaming their way to the top of every Google search result might as well be robots. Everything is commercialized. Someone‚Äôs always trying to sell you something. Whether they‚Äôre a bot or human, they are decidedly fake.

So how can we regain authenticity? What if you want to know what a genuine real life human being thinks about the latest Lenovo laptop?

You append ‚Äúreddit"" to your query (or hacker news, or stack overflow, or some other community you trust).

Google is dead.

Long live Google + ‚Äúsite:reddit.com‚Äù.

*If you are interested in more thoughts and ideas on search and organizing information, you may want to follow me on twitter* [*@dkb868*](https://twitter.com/dkb868)*.*

## Appendix 1: response from Google.

### Google claims the exact matching feature is merely unintuitive, not broken

[Danny Sullivan](https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/1493702054673485826):

&gt;I work for Google Search, passed your feedback along, thanks. You said in the post that quotes don't give exact matches. They really do. Honest. Put a word or phrase in quotes, that's what we'll match. If anyone has an example where they feel it doesn't, please let me know...  
&gt;  
&gt;Here's why people often think quoting with Google doesn't work when it really does (I've looked a huge number of these reports).  
We match ALT text  
We match text not readily visible, such as in a menu or small text  
Page has changed since we indexed it  
Punctuation...  
&gt;  
&gt;Punctuation comes into play if you did a quoted search like ""dog cat"" and there's text that says ""dog, cat"" then we'll see that without the punctuation. That doesn't seem a major issue but we're looking at if we could improve there.

### And Google seems to be right so far

Every example of exact matching not working so far can be traced back to issues with punctuation, alt text, etc.

For example, one proposed [failing query](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30355528) was ""quotes don't give"". But HN user [saalweachter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30356152) has pointed out that it is a very intricate punctuation problem.

&gt;For instances, on the \[""quotes don't give""\] example, the first result I get is https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/never-give-up  
&gt;  
&gt;If I do a find-in-page for ""quotes don't give"", I get zero results. Oh no! Perfidy!  
&gt;  
&gt;... but, if you look more closely, you'll find this string waaaaay down at the bottom:  
&gt;  
&gt;tags: don-t-give-up, don-t-give-up-on-your-dreams, don-t-give-up-on-yourself, don-t-give-up-quotes, don-t-give-up-the-fight, encouragement, ...  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks to the wonders of tokenization, that ""don-t-give-up-quotes, don-t-give-up-the-fight"" gives you the string of tokens, ""don t give up quotes don t give up the fight"", which contains the exact phrase ""quotes don t give"", which is the tokenization of the phrase ""quotes don't give"".

## Appendix 2: Google just had record profits, you are obviously wrong, and Google isn't dying.

I never said that Google wasn't making money. In fact, if Google really is squeezing every last cent out of ads without regard to search quality, I would expect their revenue to be at an all time high.

I am saying that the quality of search results are declining. This may eventually lead to a decrease in revenue, but has not yet.

## Apendix 3: Seriously, what are you talking about? My search results are perfect.

If you think your search results are perfect (without appending reddit), then you're probably right. If every single person agreed that Google search results were trash, then Google would already be bankrupt.

Perhaps it is more likely that 80% of people think Google is good enough, and 20% think Google sucks.

I do suspect that the 20% will be growing in number though.

## Appendix 4: *Yawn*, this is the 87th time someone has claimed that Google search is dying in the last 20 years. This is a big meme in the SEO world.

*""The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated"" - Google, probably*

You're right, there's been a new article bashing Google every few months for the last 20 years straight. It's probably nothing.

Still, it is a bit interesting that this short and simple post is now one of the most upvoted things of all time on Hacker News. There must be a lot of people who resonate with it this time around.

Hard to tell if something significant has changed.

## Appendix 5: Random redditor explains it succinctly

[u/a\_latvian\_potato](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/st9ri1/comment/hx3zubc/):

&gt;I think I understand what this article is trying to say. It's not saying that Google's search technology is worse or that people don't use Google to search. It's saying that people trust less of the results Google shows compared to seeing discussions of it on Reddit.  
&gt;  
&gt;For instance, if I'm looking to see reviews of the Honda Civic 2022 or whatever, I actually do find myself typing ""Honda Civic review reddit"" instead of ""Honda Civic review"". This is because I want to see what real people and enthusiasts (on r/cars or whatever) are talking about the car, rather than the top results at Google which are basically just paid reviews advertising the car anyway.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even though I kinda know people in Reddit are just as capable of spouting BS that are completely wrong, I find the discussions more authentic anyway than the corporate speak the ""big websites"" have on their articles that Google shows me.

"$AMDA can we talk? DD inside.Can we talk about $AMDA? Due to metal wear in medical implants causing metal poisoning, plastic parts causing bone loss and silicon nitride being biofriendly material, killing bacteria and promoting bone fusion I think it may be only a matter of time before silicon nitride catches momentum in spine joint and dental implants. Especially factoring the netflix documentary ""bleeding edge"" exposing the metal poisoning issue. Revision surgery for these complications are estimated at $10 billion a year in a $140 billion dollar medical implant market. The danger here is the reverse split and it's important to call the bottom before entry. My theory on bottom is based on a 15 million public offering recently closed. Don't really want to go into why I believe this indicates bottom as it's speculation. So i\`m only putting in enough I\`m completely safe with losing expecting to lose everything to revers splits and maintain strong hands. With the recent offering this should have a 35M  share  float so an estimated value of 17.5 million at .50 cents a share for the entire company(my maximum target buy price). The supposed brass ring of a $140 billion dollar industry. I can agree with this math, from what i've heard speculated, that this could translate into  a large profit, possibly on Buy out and share conversion. Obviously, looking at the ticker, This would require very strong hands to not get shook and I suggest minimizing risk here to a very small long bet. Seems like alot of Money invested into a solid material in initial public offering can be picked up off the trading room floor here for pennies on the dollar. Just hard to believe looking at the ticker and having to spend the time Deep diving the Research studies to ever consider a long hold here for the normies on wall street. I could literally talk your ear off about the material science and stock market dynamics until your eyes glazed over. Last time I could do this was $AMD Infinity fabric which the market eventually relented for me. ",1

Ignore the shares - I transferred them in so TDA thinks I got them for free or something.

I definitely think we'll see an ER run-up back to high 170s and am willing to hold at least some of these through ER. I think all the analyst chatter about iPhone X being a flop is just creating more room for a surprise to the upside. 

Obviously the pure play is just buy infinity more calls but I'm wondering if there's some kinda spread play I could set up to make things a little less lopsided. Like if I wanted to sell some contracts how would I capture max IV?

...and I bought puts as a joke a few days ago when it started dropping like a rock from 179 and have made maybe $700 this week just cashing them out and buying a couple more cheap ones at the next lowest strike, and also picking up more calls along the way.

"SPY and NASDAQ officially broke the downward trendReminder- i FINALLY am going back to work Monday night! So those of you who tuned in for the intraday discussion today (which was a lot of fun doing that together and seeing everyone talk) those wont be happening as much now. I hope to do them one or two days a week still though. I also will still try to update daily like i have been. Just some times posts may not happen to very late into the night. 

Well SPY like always wants to be the wild child of the stock market. However, even in her wildness she gives us signs and hints of where its going (thankfully). 

Historically January tends to be a bearish month, however, unless you live under a rock for the last few weeks you would see we had A LOT more than usual. From increasingly out of control inflation, ole Putin stepping out and then of course daddy powell. Big oof this month, however, as people like to say never bet against the stock market. So heres what im seeing and where we are going. 

Today we saw yet again a volatile day. I think i can speak for many of us that we expected the typical dip, run and then dip at the end of the day. Its friday after all... but spy lovessss to switch it up. That resistance line (the green dotted) was so u believably strong it had been tested and rejected 6 times. But one ole Biden started speaking he whispered sweet nothings to the market and boom boom we broke the major resistance trend.

https://i.imgur.com/Z00hnlW.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/cW0pqOE.jpeg

Ironically our sibling NASDAQ saw their similar downward channel break too. 
https://i.imgur.com/lelrP8G.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/hr0Y5ol.jpeg

On NASDAQ we got the MACD curling up to sell and the RSI trending upward. 
https://i.imgur.com/StW61cG.jpeg

On spy we have a very similiar setup occuring too. https://i.imgur.com/PPJ4oCn.jpeg

Heres what im seeing and where we may be headed and how im playing the month of February.

So nasdaq. Im seeing a clear break of the bear channel (blue dotted). But im seeing another clearly formed bullish channel (white dotted). Im seeing a resistance line near 14.1k (using previous high from 1/4 and 1/13 a perfect intersection happens at 14.1k at the top resistance line of the white dotted channel. Im also seeing the daily 20 ema intersecting around this area too. Will definitely be keeping an eye on this. 

Now with spy. We are looking at the red dotted bullish channel. Im watching a similiar trend line from 1/4 and 1/13 which intersects the top resistance line of the red dotted channel near 456. 

I note that SPYs channel is more aggressive than the NASDAQ channel. However both are on very similar trajectories here. 

Now one thing i will be watching is that even im this new bullish channel for spy is that we have a lot of downside still. The 30 min and 1 hour are still pretty overbought (not extremely but slightly). There is still a chance we see a major sell off sometime next week perhaps even monday. Currently support will be somewhere by time pre market moves and everything around 428-430. After such an impressive end of day run today it would be natural to expect some to be given back monday. 

Heres how im playing the next few weeks... (keep in mind im going back to work full time night shift so i also wont be able to day trade as much as i could the last 2 weeks).

Im going to be watching the charts next week come monday and be looking for a small dip to go long on some calls here. I will be doing my normal style: first otm strike for whenever i finally buy in but im going to do a 14 dte. Will plan to hold for some nice profit and then roll it out depending on gains and everything provable every 7 days. 

Im going to be watching for the upper resistance line test near 448-450 short term next week and long term of 456 by 2nd week of February. 

I still hope to do some intraday trading but because of work im gonna be doing mostly longs holding and rolling profits unless i see a change of direction.

One thing everyone needs to watch out for is Feb 10th inflation data releasing. No more fed meetings till March so really from here we got some room to run free till the fed drops the hammer again.",1
