Extension is on the table and keeps the show rolling with everyone possible saying "talks are going well" on every news outlet to keep SPY propped up.  My guess is that Trump offers an extension that is dependent on an Xi and him meeting face to face in the next tariff extension period (60-90 days or whatever).  Trump loves his stock market tweets and wants to keep this thing running so he can keep wearing his DOW 25,000 hat around the oval office for a while.  News headlines that China buys 3 bags of soybeans from Nebraska, one cup of SBX coffee and a Bruce Springsteen CD are announced.  SPY stays propped up/consolidates for a while during this period (SPX + /- 150 points here) during the tariff extension period or cruises to ATH if it finds solid support this next couple of weeks.\n\nTrump wants Xi and he\'s not gonna back down until he has showdown in Florida complete with a big show around the meeting.  Tariff extensions coming because the trump ego wants a big show out of this.          \n\n**On the Flip side**:  \n\nTrump just declared a national emergency on Friday to fund his wall even though it\'s probably unlikely the wall he envisions gets built without massive challenges but he did it anyway.  Trump is pretty dead set on getting his way so it\'s possible that he strong-arms here if Xi doesn\'t agree to meet soon and tariffs do hit March 1.

Here are my calculations:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[http://opcalc.com/Cuxj](http://opcalc.com/Cuxj)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpy is currently trading at 277.42, so let's set 277.5 as our strike. A 277.5 put for 3/1 is 1.92, and a 277.5 call for 3/1 is 1.94. Combine that to get 3.86 per straddle, so our break-even points are 281.36, $273.64. So now the trick is to sell 1-day calls and puts FD's to other autists, such that if the strikes are hit, we still profit. This is where optionsprofitcalculator really comes in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to the link above, we would be green tomorrow (2/22) if SPY is 276 or 280. So then we sell 280 calls and 276 puts, which will be about 60 cents of premium. Now if SPY reaches either of these two levels, we've just made at least 16%. If not, our break-evens become 280.76 and 274.24. Repeat this process for and 2/25 and 2/27, which I think should produce similar levels of premium (maybe a bit lower since the strikes will have to be wider because of theta on the straddle), so for the sake of argument let's say we get another 80 cents combined from those two dates. If the strikes are hit, we profit. If not, then we simply get even closer breakeven points, which are now 279.96 and 275.04, +-0.8%. I looked at the chart for SPY for the past couple of months (granted they're probably not be representative of the general trend), and there are very few periods where we don't move that much in a 5 trading day period. In those weeks, however, there is *always* some fluctuation between the two dates during which the options we sold would have become ITM, in which case we are able to exit with a 20% gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLiterally can't go tits up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; buying straddles and selling fd strangles is free money"), ('Your Morning Coffee [Friday, 02.22.19]', "Your Morning Coffee [Friday, 02.22.19]#Earnings\n  \nAlliant Energy (LNT) Q4 EPS USD 0.36 vs. Exp.

Here are my calculations:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[http://opcalc.com/Cuxj](http://opcalc.com/Cuxj)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpy is currently trading at 277.42, so let's set 277.5 as our strike. A 277.5 put for 3/1 is 1.92, and a 277.5 call for 3/1 is 1.94. Combine that to get 3.86 per straddle, so our break-even points are 281.36, $273.64. So now the trick is to sell 1-day calls and puts FD's to other autists, such that if the strikes are hit, we still profit. This is where optionsprofitcalculator really comes in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccording to the link above, we would be green tomorrow (2/22) if SPY is 276 or 280. So then we sell 280 calls and 276 puts, which will be about 60 cents of premium. Now if SPY reaches either of these two levels, we've just made at least 16%. If not, our break-evens become 280.76 and 274.24. Repeat this process for and 2/25 and 2/27, which I think should produce similar levels of premium (maybe a bit lower since the strikes will have to be wider because of theta on the straddle), so for the sake of argument let's say we get another 80 cents combined from those two dates. If the strikes are hit, we profit. If not, then we simply get even closer breakeven points, which are now 279.96 and 275.04, +-0.8%. I looked at the chart for SPY for the past couple of months (granted they're probably not be representative of the general trend), and there are very few periods where we don't move that much in a 5 trading day period. In those weeks, however, there is *always* some fluctuation between the two dates during which the options we sold would have become ITM, in which case we are able to exit with a 20% gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLiterally can't go tits up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; buying straddles and selling fd strangles is free money")], '2019-02-23': [('BREAKING: Warren Buffet has just confirmed that he has pulled out of the equities market, and is all in on 3/18 $TSLA calls. “ the market is extremely overpriced, I pulled out of $KHC as soon as I heard of the Elon and McKenzie funding security.

I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 18th, 2019.\n\n# **Week Ahead: Fed to make important forecasts as stocks on \'precipice\' of breaking out  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/fed-to-make-forecasts-as-stocks-on-precipice-of-breaking-out.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\'s meeting is the big deal for markets in the coming week, and it is widely expected to send a message that investors in both bonds and stocks could find bullish.\n*****\n&gt; But analysts in both markets say the Fed\'s message has been well telegraphed, and market response could be tepid or even a "sell the news" reaction.\n*****\n&gt; The key for both markets will be what the economic data shows, after a series of weak reports. Thursday\'s regional Philadelphia Fed survey and PMI data Friday on manufacturing and the services sectors will be important. Existing home sales are also released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; "The first quarter has not exactly been a hallelujah quarter, and the Fed has to acknowledge that," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady, but it is also expected to issue a new forecast with fewer rate hikes and a slower economy. The Fed also is likely to announce the end of its operation to unwind its balance sheet, but economists are divided on which month this year it will actually end the program.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks surged in the past week with the best performance since November for the S&amp;P 500, which ended up 2.9 percent. At the same time Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to fall. The bench mark 10-year Treasury slipped below 2.60 percent Friday, its lowest yield since June 4, and the 2-year was at 2.43 percent.\n*****\n&gt; The fact that both markets are rising at the same time is somewhat unusual, and at some point the trend could break in favor of one market versus the other.\n*****\n&gt; An easier Federal Reserve, meaning one less inclined to drive up rates, is viewed as a positive for stocks because higher interest rates can slow the economy and send borrowing costs higher for companies and investors. Bond yields also head lower when the Fed is not likely to raise interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; "This could be an interesting week," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. He said it should be positive for stocks if the Fed reduces its forecast for rate hikes and delivers on expectations.\n*****\n&gt; "This is the meeting where we get more clarity on the balance sheet reduction. Both those things would be an affirmation of where things are right now. It\'s also technical…where we close [on the S&amp;P] puts us on a precipice of breaking out," said Hogan.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,822, near the key 2,825 level which is the upper end of a big band of resistance. "The only down week of the year was the week before this, and the trend has been higher," he said.\n*****\n&gt; But Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment Institute chief international investment strategist, said the stock market could actually have little reaction to the Fed because Fed officials have been very dovish in public comments.\n*****\n&gt; "It could be neutral or perhaps even negative. What more can they say? You might see some people selling the fact," he said. Christopher said he sees the market as stretched, and it could sell off. But then, there could be a buying opportunity.\n*****\n&gt; "We think stocks have to start to feel better about the economy first," he said, adding a trade deal with China could be a positive.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\'s actions could also already be priced into the bond market, according to George Goncalves, head of fixed income strategy at Nomura. He said what really matters is what risk markets, or stocks, do in response.\n*****\n&gt; "There\'s scope for risk to do better and the Fed\'s not hiking. You can see it rally into the summer and the economy will look better and if that happens that will be a buying opportunity for rates," he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists see the Fed reducing its forecast for two rate hikes to one or even none for this year. They also expect it to say it will end its program to reduce the balance sheet, but they don\'t agree on whether that happens in June, September or closer to the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is currently reducing its balance sheet by allowing securities to roll down as they mature, instead of replacing all of them as it previously did. It now theoretically could allow $60 billion a month to roll off, but Fed officials could change that program and begin to repurchase securities to replace them.\n*****\n&gt; The markets are also waiting to hear if the Fed will focus solely on Treasury securities, and at what part of the curve – or duration. In the past it had purchased mortgages but is expected to discontinue that.\n*****\n&gt; "We think they\'re back to buying Treasurys by Oct. 1. Somethings got to give. At some point, its either that [bond market] people are too pessimistic and the economy is going to do well because the Fed is behind the curve, or we have another kind of correction on our hands in the next six to nine months," he said. "We just have to pass through time There\'s a powerful faith-based system around easy money can fix all things."\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to continue to forecast one rate hike for this year. The Fed interest rate forecasts appear as anonymous dots from individual Fed officials on a chart, known as the "dot plot."\n*****\n&gt; Even so, she doesn\'t expect the Fed will actually raise rates but it will continue to give itself flexibility. Economic data has been mixed with some very poor reports, like December\'s retail sales, which fell 1.6 percent, and February\'s jobs report, which showed job growth of just 20,000 jobs, 160,000 below forecast.\n*****\n&gt; "I think they have to walk a fine line between acknowledging the weakness we\'ve seen and then also show that we\'re still going to see growth this year," she said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/o0pDJXr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kBp9n1f.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/c1IYRzX.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/K46gPv6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jZuMWuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pzeom1o.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lEbfODX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K4AdHOF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NIPJ8sV.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO\'s for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jZdyLdK.png))**\n\n# **Friday\'s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UPm6C69.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sfSMisb.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Irish Eyes Shine on Market Last 25 Years, but Monday After Sunday St. Patrick’s Day Weaker\n\n&gt; Saint Patrick’s Day is the only cultural event that perennially lands in March. Over the years gains the day before Saint Patrick’s Day have proved to be slightly better than the day itself and the day after. Perhaps it’s the anticipation of the patron saint’s holiday that boosts the market and the distraction from the parade down Fifth Avenue that causes equity markets to languish. Perhaps it’s the all the green folks don that stirs up thoughts of money and market gains. More likely, it’s the fact that Saint Pat’s typically falls in historically bullish Triple-Witching Week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c625182aa350a6356847eb0e14d70a58/tumblr_inline_poey5afw611spdppr_1280.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Whatever the case, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 posts an average gain of 0.19% on Saint Patrick’s Day (or the next trading day when it falls on a weekend), a gain of 0.13% the day after and the day before averages a 0.24% advance. S&amp;P 500 median values are 0.17% on the day before, 0.20% on Saint Patrick’s Day and 0.07% on the day after.\n\n&gt; In the nine years when St. Patrick’s Day falls on a Sunday like this year, since 1950, Friday advanced an average 0.15% and the following Monday suffered an average loss of -0.08%. However, over the last 25 years market performance on Saint Patrick’s Day and the day after has improved, up 72% of the time on the Holiday with an average gain of 0.57%.\n\n*****\n\n# The Bespoke Report – Break Out the Monocle\n\n&gt; Below is an updated look at our ETF Asset Class Performance Matrix, which shows the total returns of key ETFs across assets classes on both a YTD, MTD basis as well as over the last week. How strong were global equity markets this week? Well of all the equity-related ETFs in the matrix, not a single one finished the week in the red. Even Industrials (XLI), which were dragged down by Boeing (BA), managed to eke out a gain of 0.2%. Among US indices, the Nasdaq 100 blew away the field rallying over 4%, but every other US index ETF was up over 1.4%. International markets were even stronger with India (PIN), Brazil (EWZ), and China (ASHR) all rallying more than 4%. Rounding out the four names from BRIC, Russia (RSX) even rallied 3.5%. In terms of YTD leaders, China and Crude oil are neck and neck for the top spot with gains of 25%+.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/031519-Asset-Class-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Most Loved Stocks in the S&amp;P 500\n\n&gt; Earlier this week we provided a full update on analyst sentiment across sectors and individual stocks in our Closer report. Below are a few charts and tables that we’ve pulled from the big report in case you’re interested.\n\n&gt; As shown below, there are 22 analyst ratings per stock in the S&amp;P 500 on average. But Energy and Communication Services have more than 29 ratings per stock! It’s hard to find an edge with nearly 30 analysts covering a name.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ratingsper.png))**\n\n&gt; Notably, the Energy sector also has the highest percentage of analyst Buy ratings, which is surprising given that Energy has been the weakest sector of the market since the S&amp;P peaked last September. It looks like analysts think the sell-off for Energy has caused valuations to become more attractive.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/buyratings.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a table listing the S&amp;P 500 stocks with the highest percentage of Buy ratings right now. There are 3 stocks in the index that have 100% Buy ratings — Marathon Petroleum (MPC), ABIOMED (ABMD), and Keysight Tech (KEYS). Both MPC and ABMD are basically flat this year, but KEYS is up 39% YTD. Even after the gains, though, analysts still love KEYS.\n\n&gt; Other notables on the list of most loved stocks include mega-caps like Amazon.com (AMZN) with 93.9% Buy ratings, Alphabet (GOOGL) with 93.2% Buy ratings, and Microsoft (MSFT) with 91.9% Buy ratings. Diamondback Energy (FANG) is the most loved Energy sector stock, while AMETEK (AME) is the most loved Industrials stock.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/most-buys.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Sector Trailing 12-Month P/E Ratios\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio got down into the low 15s at the bottom in late December, but we’ve seen huge P/E expansion as the market has rallied back. As of this afternoon, the S&amp;P’s trailing 12-month P/E sits at 18.61. Even still, that’s well below readings in the 20s that were seen for a number of weeks in 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spxpe0315.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show one-year P/E ratio charts for major S&amp;P 500 sectors. Since the December lows, we’ve seen P/E expansion in every sector, but the one that stands out the most is Utilities.\n\n&gt; We went into detail on extended valuations for the Utilities sector in yesterday’s Chart of the Day for members, but you can see the spike up to 19.80 in the one-year chart for Utilities below. At 19.80, only Technology, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary have higher trailing 12-month P/E ratios than Utilities right now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pes1.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pes2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Pre-Election-Year March Historically Stronger\n\n&gt; As of today’s close, this pre-election year March is below average when compared to it historical performance. Strong market performance in pre-presidential-election year frequently translates into above average performance for individual months. March is a month that typically enjoys a nice boost, but so far it has not occurred. Prior to the gains of today and yesterday, this March was well off its average levels. This March and past pre-election year average performance has been plotted in the chart above and the gap in performance is readily visible.\n\n&gt; Strong gains in January and February had major indexes right at key resistance levels at the start of the month and when they failed to break out profit taking ensued. Slowing global growth, naming in China and the EU along with ongoing trade concerns and last Friday’s tepid jobs report have all weighed on stocks. Heavy selling of DJIA’s largest component, Boeing (BA) has kept that index in check this week. Despite sign of slowing growth, the US economy is still on relatively firm ground when compared to other regions. Further market gains are likely, but progress is probably going to be choppy.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/240ec014a88232565f1ddd73d819e3a5/tumblr_inline_po9tds4Dcv1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# What Type of Pullback Could We See?\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index corrected nearly 20% from the September peak until December 24 before staging a furious rally of 19%. What could happen next? A well-deserved pullback would be perfectly normal, and in fact, is probably needed before another surge higher can occur. Now the $64,000 question: Would a pullback be a retest of the December lows, a 10% correction, or something more modest?\n\n&gt; As we discussed in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Modest Pullback Or Something Bigger? we think a pullback in the range of 3–5% is the most likely scenario. “We continue to see solid fundamentals, valuations that are quite reasonable, the strong possibility of a U.S.-China trade deal over the coming months, and healthy market technicals,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. In fact, six technical indicators we mentioned in the recent commentary suggest a pullback could offer buying opportunities for suitable investors:\n\n&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is above its upward sloping 50-day moving average (MA), suggesting an improving trend, and at support in the form of its 200-day moving average.\n&gt; * March has been the second strongest month for the stock market over the past 20 years.\n&gt; * Stocks tend to go up in the final 10 months of a year (25 out of the last 27 years) after experiencing gains during January and February.\n&gt; * Market breadth is favorable, with a high proportion of stocks participating in this year’s advance.\n&gt; * Investor flows have been negative in 2019—evidence of caution, not euphoria\n&gt; * Investor sentiment surveys suggest bulls are not in overabundance.\n\n&gt; Last, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, it’s important to remember that the S&amp;P 500 has been higher a year after every midterm election since World War II—that’s 18 out of the past 18 midterms—with an average return of 14.2%. President Trump views the stock market as part of his re-election path, suggesting this pattern could hold once again. With the S&amp;P 500 up only 1.3% since the midterm election last November, there indeed could still be room for stocks to run in 2019.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Stocks-Have-Done-Well-After-Midterm-Elections.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for March 15th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.17.19 - Back to all time highs?** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$OSTK** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$PLX** \n&gt; * **$DSW** \n&gt; * **$UNIT** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACRS** \n&gt; * **$STNE** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$NVGS** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$TME** \n&gt; * **$SYNH** \n&gt; * **$MIK** \n&gt; * **$TACO** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$AMRS** \n&gt; * **$TLGT** \n&gt; * **$WSM** \n&gt; * **$LEJU** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$MTBC** \n&gt; * **$GEN** \n&gt; * **$CELP** \n&gt; * **$GPX** \n&gt; * **$YIN** \n&gt; * **$WKHS** \n&gt; * **$HZN** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$WPM**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK\'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NIPJ8sV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK\'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/OQYi4c1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/JsxWsJc.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\'S MOST NOTABLE PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/nFRh0bk.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.18.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8oXi6MW.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.18.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xCALfZ6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.19.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4d1zoM2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.19.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y2MoJ8V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.20.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GvK7hok.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.20.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/87c4Gw9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.21.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XFD8LSR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.21.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nXt8qpy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.22.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KcK1ci9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.22.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Tilray, Inc. $72.50 \n&gt; **Tilray, Inc.

Thursday\'s regional Philadelphia Fed survey and PMI data Friday on manufacturing and the services sectors will be important. Existing home sales are also released Thursday.\n*****\n&gt; "The first quarter has not exactly been a hallelujah quarter, and the Fed has to acknowledge that," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady, but it is also expected to issue a new forecast with fewer rate hikes and a slower economy. The Fed also is likely to announce the end of its operation to unwind its balance sheet, but economists are divided on which month this year it will actually end the program.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks surged in the past week with the best performance since November for the S&amp;P 500, which ended up 2.9 percent. At the same time Treasury yields, which move opposite price, continued to fall. The bench mark 10-year Treasury slipped below 2.60 percent Friday, its lowest yield since June 4, and the 2-year was at 2.43 percent.\n*****\n&gt; The fact that both markets are rising at the same time is somewhat unusual, and at some point the trend could break in favor of one market versus the other.\n*****\n&gt; An easier Federal Reserve, meaning one less inclined to drive up rates, is viewed as a positive for stocks because higher interest rates can slow the economy and send borrowing costs higher for companies and investors. Bond yields also head lower when the Fed is not likely to raise interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; "This could be an interesting week," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. He said it should be positive for stocks if the Fed reduces its forecast for rate hikes and delivers on expectations.\n*****\n&gt; "This is the meeting where we get more clarity on the balance sheet reduction. Both those things would be an affirmation of where things are right now. It\'s also technical…where we close [on the S&amp;P] puts us on a precipice of breaking out," said Hogan.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,822, near the key 2,825 level which is the upper end of a big band of resistance. "The only down week of the year was the week before this, and the trend has been higher," he said.\n*****\n&gt; But Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment Institute chief international investment strategist, said the stock market could actually have little reaction to the Fed because Fed officials have been very dovish in public comments.\n*****\n&gt; "It could be neutral or perhaps even negative. What more can they say? You might see some people selling the fact," he said. Christopher said he sees the market as stretched, and it could sell off. But then, there could be a buying opportunity.\n*****\n&gt; "We think stocks have to start to feel better about the economy first," he said, adding a trade deal with China could be a positive.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed\'s actions could also already be priced into the bond market, according to George Goncalves, head of fixed income strategy at Nomura. He said what really matters is what risk markets, or stocks, do in response.\n*****\n&gt; "There\'s scope for risk to do better and the Fed\'s not hiking. You can see it rally into the summer and the economy will look better and if that happens that will be a buying opportunity for rates," he said.\n*****\n&gt; Economists see the Fed reducing its forecast for two rate hikes to one or even none for this year. They also expect it to say it will end its program to reduce the balance sheet, but they don\'t agree on whether that happens in June, September or closer to the end of the year.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed is currently reducing its balance sheet by allowing securities to roll down as they mature, instead of replacing all of them as it previously did. It now theoretically could allow $60 billion a month to roll off, but Fed officials could change that program and begin to repurchase securities to replace them.\n*****\n&gt; The markets are also waiting to hear if the Fed will focus solely on Treasury securities, and at what part of the curve – or duration. In the past it had purchased mortgages but is expected to discontinue that.\n*****\n&gt; "We think they\'re back to buying Treasurys by Oct. 1. Somethings got to give. At some point, its either that [bond market] people are too pessimistic and the economy is going to do well because the Fed is behind the curve, or we have another kind of correction on our hands in the next six to nine months," he said. "We just have to pass through time There\'s a powerful faith-based system around easy money can fix all things."\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to continue to forecast one rate hike for this year. The Fed interest rate forecasts appear as anonymous dots from individual Fed officials on a chart, known as the "dot plot."\n*****\n&gt; Even so, she doesn\'t expect the Fed will actually raise rates but it will continue to give itself flexibility. Economic data has been mixed with some very poor reports, like December\'s retail sales, which fell 1.6 percent, and February\'s jobs report, which showed job growth of just 20,000 jobs, 160,000 below forecast.\n*****\n&gt; "I think they have to walk a fine line between acknowledging the weakness we\'ve seen and then also show that we\'re still going to see growth this year," she said.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/o0pDJXr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kBp9n1f.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/c1IYRzX.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/K46gPv6.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jZuMWuS.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pzeom1o.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lEbfODX.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/K4AdHOF.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NIPJ8sV.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO\'s for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jZdyLdK.png))**\n\n# **Friday\'s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/UPm6C69.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sfSMisb.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Irish Eyes Shine on Market Last 25 Years, but Monday After Sunday St. Patrick’s Day Weaker\n\n&gt; Saint Patrick’s Day is the only cultural event that perennially lands in March. Over the years gains the day before Saint Patrick’s Day have proved to be slightly better than the day itself and the day after. Perhaps it’s the anticipation of the patron saint’s holiday that boosts the market and the distraction from the parade down Fifth Avenue that causes equity markets to languish. Perhaps it’s the all the green folks don that stirs up thoughts of money and market gains. More likely, it’s the fact that Saint Pat’s typically falls in historically bullish Triple-Witching Week.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/c625182aa350a6356847eb0e14d70a58/tumblr_inline_poey5afw611spdppr_1280.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Whatever the case, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 posts an average gain of 0.19% on Saint Patrick’s Day (or the next trading day when it falls on a weekend), a gain of 0.13% the day after and the day before averages a 0.24% advance. S&amp;P 500 median values are 0.17% on the day before, 0.20% on Saint Patrick’s Day and 0.07% on the day after.\n\n&gt; In the nine years when St. Patrick’s Day falls on a Sunday like this year, since 1950, Friday advanced an average 0.15% and the following Monday suffered an average loss of -0.08%. However, over the last 25 years market performance on Saint Patrick’s Day and the day after has improved, up 72% of the time on the Holiday with an average gain of 0.57%.\n\n*****\n\n# The Bespoke Report – Break Out the Monocle\n\n&gt; Below is an updated look at our ETF Asset Class Performance Matrix, which shows the total returns of key ETFs across assets classes on both a YTD, MTD basis as well as over the last week. How strong were global equity markets this week? Well of all the equity-related ETFs in the matrix, not a single one finished the week in the red. Even Industrials (XLI), which were dragged down by Boeing (BA), managed to eke out a gain of 0.2%. Among US indices, the Nasdaq 100 blew away the field rallying over 4%, but every other US index ETF was up over 1.4%. International markets were even stronger with India (PIN), Brazil (EWZ), and China (ASHR) all rallying more than 4%. Rounding out the four names from BRIC, Russia (RSX) even rallied 3.5%. In terms of YTD leaders, China and Crude oil are neck and neck for the top spot with gains of 25%+.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/031519-Asset-Class-Performance.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Most Loved Stocks in the S&amp;P 500\n\n&gt; Earlier this week we provided a full update on analyst sentiment across sectors and individual stocks in our Closer report. Below are a few charts and tables that we’ve pulled from the big report in case you’re interested.\n\n&gt; As shown below, there are 22 analyst ratings per stock in the S&amp;P 500 on average. But Energy and Communication Services have more than 29 ratings per stock! It’s hard to find an edge with nearly 30 analysts covering a name.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ratingsper.png))**\n\n&gt; Notably, the Energy sector also has the highest percentage of analyst Buy ratings, which is surprising given that Energy has been the weakest sector of the market since the S&amp;P peaked last September. It looks like analysts think the sell-off for Energy has caused valuations to become more attractive.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/buyratings.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a table listing the S&amp;P 500 stocks with the highest percentage of Buy ratings right now. There are 3 stocks in the index that have 100% Buy ratings — Marathon Petroleum (MPC), ABIOMED (ABMD), and Keysight Tech (KEYS). Both MPC and ABMD are basically flat this year, but KEYS is up 39% YTD. Even after the gains, though, analysts still love KEYS.\n\n&gt; Other notables on the list of most loved stocks include mega-caps like Amazon.com (AMZN) with 93.9% Buy ratings, Alphabet (GOOGL) with 93.2% Buy ratings, and Microsoft (MSFT) with 91.9% Buy ratings. Diamondback Energy (FANG) is the most loved Energy sector stock, while AMETEK (AME) is the most loved Industrials stock.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/most-buys.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Sector Trailing 12-Month P/E Ratios\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio got down into the low 15s at the bottom in late December, but we’ve seen huge P/E expansion as the market has rallied back. As of this afternoon, the S&amp;P’s trailing 12-month P/E sits at 18.61. Even still, that’s well below readings in the 20s that were seen for a number of weeks in 2018.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/spxpe0315.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we show one-year P/E ratio charts for major S&amp;P 500 sectors. Since the December lows, we’ve seen P/E expansion in every sector, but the one that stands out the most is Utilities.\n\n&gt; We went into detail on extended valuations for the Utilities sector in yesterday’s Chart of the Day for members, but you can see the spike up to 19.80 in the one-year chart for Utilities below. At 19.80, only Technology, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary have higher trailing 12-month P/E ratios than Utilities right now.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pes1.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pes2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Pre-Election-Year March Historically Stronger\n\n&gt; As of today’s close, this pre-election year March is below average when compared to it historical performance. Strong market performance in pre-presidential-election year frequently translates into above average performance for individual months. March is a month that typically enjoys a nice boost, but so far it has not occurred. Prior to the gains of today and yesterday, this March was well off its average levels. This March and past pre-election year average performance has been plotted in the chart above and the gap in performance is readily visible.\n\n&gt; Strong gains in January and February had major indexes right at key resistance levels at the start of the month and when they failed to break out profit taking ensued. Slowing global growth, naming in China and the EU along with ongoing trade concerns and last Friday’s tepid jobs report have all weighed on stocks. Heavy selling of DJIA’s largest component, Boeing (BA) has kept that index in check this week. Despite sign of slowing growth, the US economy is still on relatively firm ground when compared to other regions. Further market gains are likely, but progress is probably going to be choppy.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/240ec014a88232565f1ddd73d819e3a5/tumblr_inline_po9tds4Dcv1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# What Type of Pullback Could We See?\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 Index corrected nearly 20% from the September peak until December 24 before staging a furious rally of 19%. What could happen next? A well-deserved pullback would be perfectly normal, and in fact, is probably needed before another surge higher can occur. Now the $64,000 question: Would a pullback be a retest of the December lows, a 10% correction, or something more modest?\n\n&gt; As we discussed in our recent Weekly Market Commentary: Modest Pullback Or Something Bigger? we think a pullback in the range of 3–5% is the most likely scenario. “We continue to see solid fundamentals, valuations that are quite reasonable, the strong possibility of a U.S.-China trade deal over the coming months, and healthy market technicals,” explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. In fact, six technical indicators we mentioned in the recent commentary suggest a pullback could offer buying opportunities for suitable investors:\n\n&gt; * The S&amp;P 500 is above its upward sloping 50-day moving average (MA), suggesting an improving trend, and at support in the form of its 200-day moving average.\n&gt; * March has been the second strongest month for the stock market over the past 20 years.\n&gt; * Stocks tend to go up in the final 10 months of a year (25 out of the last 27 years) after experiencing gains during January and February.\n&gt; * Market breadth is favorable, with a high proportion of stocks participating in this year’s advance.\n&gt; * Investor flows have been negative in 2019—evidence of caution, not euphoria\n&gt; * Investor sentiment surveys suggest bulls are not in overabundance.\n\n&gt; Last, as our LPL Chart of the Day shows, it’s important to remember that the S&amp;P 500 has been higher a year after every midterm election since World War II—that’s 18 out of the past 18 midterms—with an average return of 14.2%. President Trump views the stock market as part of his re-election path, suggesting this pattern could hold once again. With the S&amp;P 500 up only 1.3% since the midterm election last November, there indeed could still be room for stocks to run in 2019.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Stocks-Have-Done-Well-After-Midterm-Elections.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for March 15th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.17.19 - Back to all time highs?** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$TLRY** \n&gt; * **$MU** \n&gt; * **$OSTK** \n&gt; * **$NVAX** \n&gt; * **$LL** \n&gt; * **$FDX** \n&gt; * **$NKE** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$PLX** \n&gt; * **$DSW** \n&gt; * **$UNIT** \n&gt; * **$ZUO** \n&gt; * **$GIS** \n&gt; * **$ACRS** \n&gt; * **$STNE** \n&gt; * **$JKS** \n&gt; * **$TIF** \n&gt; * **$DRI** \n&gt; * **$NVGS** \n&gt; * **$CSIQ** \n&gt; * **$HDS** \n&gt; * **$CAG** \n&gt; * **$TME** \n&gt; * **$SYNH** \n&gt; * **$MIK** \n&gt; * **$TACO** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$AMRS** \n&gt; * **$TLGT** \n&gt; * **$WSM** \n&gt; * **$LEJU** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$CMC** \n&gt; * **$MTBC** \n&gt; * **$GEN** \n&gt; * **$CELP** \n&gt; * **$GPX** \n&gt; * **$YIN** \n&gt; * **$WKHS** \n&gt; * **$HZN** \n&gt; * **$GES** \n&gt; * **$WPM**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK\'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NIPJ8sV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK\'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/OQYi4c1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/JsxWsJc.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\'S MOST NOTABLE PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/nFRh0bk.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.18.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8oXi6MW.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 3.18.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xCALfZ6.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.19.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/4d1zoM2.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 3.19.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/y2MoJ8V.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.20.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GvK7hok.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 3.20.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/87c4Gw9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.21.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XFD8LSR.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 3.21.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/nXt8qpy.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.22.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/KcK1ci9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 3.22.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Tilray, Inc. $72.50 \n&gt; **Tilray, Inc.

Instead of gambling &amp; holding SPY calls overnight (which I still do sometimes when I predict daily/weekly/monthly moves) I've found it can be just as rewarding -again if you have the time, real-time quotes, &amp; an inclination for yolo- to day trade SPY. The logic is that SPY has been inversing itself in the first hour or so of trading recently which can bring huge gains on options about to expire. Basically you buy slightly OTM options (&lt;$1) w/ expiry either the next day or the day you're trading at the low, and sell high.\n\nYeah. Obviously this is risky AF as theta seriously works against you and if SPY doesn't rise or fall fast enough you're screwed, not to mention if it goes the wrong way. A stop loss isn't a bad idea but gaps will hurt as well as the fact that you dont want to sell down 20% only to have it go up 100% (which happens all the time).\n\nAn example is today (or all last week...) SPY challenged 282.50 for the second time at approx 11am (bit later than usual) and I had my market order of 200 shares (fidelity's limit) ready to go on 282p. I wound up not executing because I wasn't positive of action, last monday we mooned and wasn't sure how today/this week would trade, if we would be held back by fed on weds, along with BA &amp; FB selloff (obviously we were and there's a reason why I'm on r/wsb).

These are the picks I'm watching this week and plan on making plays into. Trade at your own risk. When I use the term YOLO play, it doesn't necessarily mean FD's, because some tickers are light on option chains.

Picks are generated from that scan. A few of the criteria:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* $10 mark and higher\n* Max PE of 25\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of March 25th, 2019\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Lennar (LEN) - BULLISH*** \\- With the housing data that just came out being so positive for existing homes, in the interim to their earnings on 3/27 before market, there's room for Lennar to run up even though they're a builder. You have a chance to capture IV gains, or hold through earnings if you have the balls. Interest rates having been low means people were likely building and buying all homes, in fact, I have three friends who I didn't even know could afford a house build, and my parents also, in the last six months. They build piles of houses in my area, in fact just started a new development with 100+ houses after finishing one with 125. They're a huge player, off their 52W highs by quite a bit, and with interest rates low, buying should be increasing.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $50 calls @ $1.23**\n   * Hold until before earnings, sell for IV gains on the 26th before market close.\n* **Earnings: 4/18 $52.50 calls @ $0.60 or 5/17 $55 calls at $0.54**\n   * Hold through earnings. Even if it goes against you, if you have the May calls, you have plenty of time to recover. If earnings are good, give the trade time to run and scale out slowly if you want.\n* **YOLO: 4/18 $55 calls @ $0.28, hold and pray.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Apple (AAPL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Apple's recently received an upgrade, and is $42 off it's 52 week high. There is way more upside than downside here. People that are buying in are buying in to hold through the service announcement and hopefully realize new all time highs. I think Apple's being accumulated, we saw a $7 price movement on Thursday, some people bought at the top, and are committed to this for term now. Their event Monday will hopefully bring a pop, followed by a fomo climb. Short term target for me is around $205-208. I currently hold $230 calls with about 90 DTE still, that I bought when Apple was at $170. They're up 600%, and I refuse to scale out. I think there's still a bunch of upside.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $215 calls @ $0.39**\n   * Ride through the event, gauge the movement, and take gains or hope for a swing up on more accumulation. We touched $197+ the morning of the selloff, and $196.33 the day before. If the week is green, this is over $200 by end of week.\n* **Streaming Event: 3/29 $192.50 calls @ $2.88**\n   * These were way more expensive before the sell off, and with the fact I see us rebounding from that, it (maybe) literally cannot go tits up. I don't imagine massive downside after the event, there's a reason they released all that hardware without announcements or a proper event for the hardware last week. They've got more going on then people think.\n* **YOLO: 3/29 $200 calls @ $0.96**\n   * The ultimate delight, run up required, and I'd advocate just selling off at 200% max after a pump before or after the event. If you have balls of steel, hold to expiration and hope the bull run for it continues. It only needs about 1.5% gains from last weeks high and I see it being accumulated more in the coming days, so it's definitely possible we see this type jump this week.\n* **Long Swing: 6/21 $235 calls @ $0.50**\n   * Probably not riding this one out until expiration, and I'd liquidate no later than May 5th-10th or so to avoid theta ramp. That being said, there's 1,000% upside here still easily, and you have more room/time to get out with minimal losses if it starts going against you after the event.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Royal Bank of Canada (RY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- With the (hopefully) short term inversion of the yield curve, people are going to be very bearish on all financials. RBC was one of the smallest losers on Friday, and with more room down to 52W lows than space up to their high, and with the explosion of put volume in the big money market, I'd say that most funds are betting against it for good reason. It will take time for the US curve to affect a Canadian bank, but with the state of the global market, in the short term, this is going to lose ground speculatively. I wouldn't look for a long term play here. Play the market sentiment.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $75 puts @ $0.75**\n   * Let it drop, and decide when to take profits. Bounce out if it gaps above 78.50, it's going to likely be a loser no matter what then with the time until expiration.\n* **ITM bearish credit spread: Buy ITM 4/18 $75 calls, Sell ITM 4/18 $70 calls @ $4.48 credit per contract**\n   * Risk to reward is 9:1 here. Max profit is around $69.95 share price on 4/17 for $4,480 on a $520 risk. Basically, you're taking advantage of the extra premium and time value on ITM calls and praying for a big move down in the next month. Profit @ $71 share price is anywhere from 1800-3100 ramping up the closer to expiration you are. You'll be paying $52 a contract in collateral to open this spread. If you go with it - DO NOT LEG INTO IT. Open the position as a spread in whatever platform, and make sure you MAINTAIN YOUR LONG LEG. IF you get assigned early, your loss is capped at $52 a contract, but you can possibly liquidate those long legs and make more if it drops. You should not get assigned early here, simply giving information on how to play these. To reach max profit, you have to hold until expiration. Your breakeven at expiration is $74.49 on this exact trade at the numbers given. Anything below that will net you the exact amount below. Ex: $73.49 x 100 contracts = $1k.***WARNING:*** If your $75 long leg is out of the money near expiration and the short leg is ITM still, IE: share price anywhere between $70 and $75, **BE FUCKING SURE TO LIQUIDATE THURSDAY, OR FRIDAY MORNING BEFORE EXPIRATION.** There is **PIN RISK HERE. If you do not know what PIN RISK IS, DO NOT DO THIS TRADE.** Pin risk is basically getting pinned on a credit spread with no stop loss long leg as it expires, and then having the shares shift against your position once the short leg is assigned to you. This means your max loss has uncapped, and you can get fucked. You've been warned.\n* **YOLO: 4/18 $70 puts @ $0.10**\n   * If it tanks, you make bank. Simple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Not a lot to be said here. Volumes up, people seem to be accumulating. Twitter's site usage is going to increase exponentially ramping to the presidential election and campaign trail. Call volume is up. I'd just make a directional bet based on momentum solely on those factors. 50% share price upside to the 52 high. If you know how, watch the RSI and if it gets above 71-72, look for an exit. If it gets accumulated too fast and your'e short term, people will profit take on this before more accumulating happens.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $36 calls @ $0.44**\n   * Look to exit these before expiration unless they spike into the money. I'd estimate at 150-250% gains. Pure momentum play/demand play.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.76**\n   * You get more time here to decide what to do. If it ramps up hard to $38-$40 share price in the next 30 days, you can lock in a nice profit, cash some out and let some ride, or let them all ride longer. I'd be exiting this no later than May 10th if they don't look like they're making it to the strike.\n* **YOLO: 3/29 $33.5 calls @ $0.60**\n   * These are sitting around a .40 delta, .19 gamma, which is pretty good with a .06 theta. You only need about $0.15 of stock price gains per day to offset the theta. If it gaps way up, you've got a choice to make whether to watch it run or profit take. Anywhere from 50% to 1,000% is possible here depending what happens with the wider market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Stocks That Could Be Worth A Look\n\n**Bullish:** Eversource Energy (ES), XCEL Energey (XEL), Kellogg (K), Hershey Company (HSY), Travelers (TRV), McDonalds (MCD), Verizon (VZ), Fidelity (FNF), Best Buy (BBY)\n\n**Bearish:** Smucker (SJM), Philip Morris (PM), Pepsi (PEP), Waste Management (WM), AES Corp (AES), McCormick (MKC), Yum China (YUMC), Sysco (SYY, after dividend), Mondelez (MDLZ)\n\n# State of the Market\n\nEverybody's worried about a big pullback. I'm not, at the current moment. A recession will come with time, but I don't think it's this week and I think last week's action was purely profit taking by institutions and algorithms. They've found exits and gotten back out of positions many were stuck in for months, remember: Some people buy shares and not options. We saw mid day consolidation on a rise, and more profit taking at the end of the day. Timing it isn't possible, so don't try to. As far as the numbers are concerned, this is still a bull market, and although I like Gundlach, he feels so perma bear that I don't know we can take his words for face value. I think he's seriously short -- and bleeding trying to pull a Dr. Burry. We gained too far too fast on Thursday after fed announcements, and people saw a chance to cash out.\n\n# Best Way To Play These Picks\n\nAt any given time if you have more than 3-4 tickers open for options and you're not a professional trader, you're probably not making correlated picks. An example is playing Apple and SPY. If Apple gains, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards Apple. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying AAPL puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale. Play a few of these positions, or just one, and find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, you'll see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding markets are a good way to double dip on plays. Anyone who supplies Lennar's components for homes, is also probably good (Home Depot, Lowes, etc).\n\n# Want Me To Cover A Ticker?\n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to do a quick analysis of it, if the underlying looks worth it. If it's not, I'll just tell you it's not. If it is, I'll add a section below here that's WSB Picks and pick a few plays on it based on the same criteria the above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave fun, good luck, get tendies."), ('How to be slightly less autistic with options', 'How to be slightly less autistic with optionsAt the request of another redditor, I am making my first post and describing how to actually make money off of options consistently.

If you\'re assigned, you\'ll have 100 shares of AMD and the $80 you got for selling the put.\n\n"Covered call" means you sell a call on a position you already have 100 shares of. For example, if you just got assigned those 100 AMD shares, you can sell a covered call the following week at a strike of $26.50 and collect another $80. If they get called-away, you\'ll sell the lot for $2,650 and keep the $80 you got for selling the call.\n\nIf we follow our example above further, you just made $160, or 6%, in about 2 weeks.

Right now, AMD $26 puts expiring on April 12 are paying $1.13/share in premium, or about 4% in 3 weeks. A strike price $0.37 out-of-the-money is going for $1.13/share.

Bearish divergence on the hourly chart for both the AO and the RSI. If this play doesn't work out intraday I'm fine holding for several days. Looking for a mid day rally in NVDA with overbought RSI on 5 or 15 min charts for a entry into puts. However, If I see signs of slowing momentum early, I might pull the trigger in the first 30 min-1 hour. Probably looking at 5/17 190s.\n2. See a similar story with AAPL, bearish divergence on the RSI, not as clear in the AO but we do have two red ticks at the end of the histogram. [https://imgur.com/a/kCgR8SJ](https://imgur.com/a/kCgR8SJ). Going back to my forecasts, I'll be looking to get in to some puts 15-30 minutes after open. Right now I have my eye on 5/17 195s. Same story with NVDA, if I don't get the move I'm looking for, perfectly happy holding as I see some signs of slowing momentum on the daily charts.\n\nFeel free to comment your own TA, critique my model/TA, or just as questions. I've gotten a lot of helpful feedback about my model from the daily thread so looking forward to some more feedback.

Trade at your own risk, **this is not investment advice, it's simply a transcription of my own notes that I'm willing to share.** *When I use the term YOLO play,* ***it doesn't necessarily mean FD's,*** because some tickers are light on option chains.

When you enter or exit a trade is your OWN DEAL. I cannot and will not give you advice on any of your own trades or positions. This is part of the learning process. Moreover, trading is about simply selling something for more than you bought it for. I don't have any hard and fast rules I follow, I simply do it by feel and intuition.\n\n# How My Picks Are Generated\n\nThese plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money. Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I played this harder than some of my other picks. It didn't do nearly as well as Bank of America early in the week, but overall, it did good. I'm still bullish on Twitter, and personally think it's busting out of some long term consolidation. It peaked almost 10% from the start of the week, my spreads worked out, I am personally holding a few longer termed contracts.\n\n**Gamestop (GME) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- So, they definitely ate shit on earnings, I sold half my contracts at open and the other half basically broke even because of IV. I wasn't looking to hold them and watch the company drive into the ground, made an okay profit, but I was hoping the bottom would fall out after earnings. Either way, the company is not looking well and is eventually going to 0 or getting acquired.\n\n**Aurora Cannabis (ACB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- This one didn't really work out for me. I've been averaging down anyway because I'm stubborn and I think it's going up, but, whatever - can't all be two and three baggers.\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Did exactly what I presumed it would. I'm not in any positions on this anymore, but it's staying on my radar. I expect financials to do well in the coming weeks, so I may randomly jump into it intraweek if I am feeling spicy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 8th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific plays are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each contract listed is not a suggestion to buy, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- This company is a gigantic mess. They set extremely high guidance for whatever reason last time around, and I highly doubt that they're going to meet it. Their margins are awful, and the only reason we'd see activists going after the board is if the inner workings of the company were crumbling. I'm playing this as an earnings play, I'm already in some puts for it, and plan on being in more depending where movement goes this week pre-earnings. Even if they do somehow magically rise off their call, I'm bag holding them. It seems that with poor earning calls, the stock moves violently, sometimes as much as 20%. Market makers seem to be pricing in about a $2 move, which to me, is reasonable, but it could move as much as $3-$3.50 in my opinion based on everything going on.\n\n* **Short term earnings YOLO: 4/18 $16.50 puts @ $0.37 or $15.50 puts @ $0.17**\n   * I'm likely not bag holding these past earnings more than a couple hours after open Thursday. The $15.50 puts is a complete lotto ticket, kind of the $16.50's too but after the last couple weeks I'm feeling spicy and I might decide to throw a couple hundred at it and see if we can reverse that massive gap up they had earlier this month. 10-bagger territory potential. I expect to take these to 0 if they beat earnings by some miracle.\n* **Longer term: 5/17 $16 puts @ $0.62 or $15 puts @ $0.38**\n   * Not sure what I'll do with either of these, depends on price action on Thursday after open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- They released some pretty killer news with their fuel costs potentially being flat, and even though they ran hard, I think it's got a ways longer to go. That news however is kind of concerning, almost as though to me they may be protecting against a bad earnings report. Either way, not enough for me to not bet on them. The stock trades at a very reasonable valuation, and they also don't have any 737 Max 8's in their fleet which kind of exempts them from being vulnerable to the production slowdowns Boeing just announced.\n\n* **YOLO: 4/12 $59 calls @ $0.60**\n   * IV is surprisingly low on these.

I don't know though, I'll let you know if anything comes of it and I decide to do it and if I do, mods will have to approve it first. It's working out alright thus far, and I don't do much trading on Robinhood so I figured I would do something with some YOLO bucks to see what I can do. Part of it is to prove that people don't need 25k to make money trading, PDT isn't holding people back, and there's ways to increase a small account quickly without as much risk as some people take. We'll see if this comes to fruition or not.\n\n# Stocks That Could Be Worth A Look\n\n**Bullish:** Hostess (TWNK), Cars dot com (CARS), Banco Bilbao (BBVA), Humana (HUM), Cypress Semi (CY), Nordstrom (JWN), Hanesbrands (HBI), Fox Corp (FOXA), American Eagle (AEO)\n\n**Bearish:** Skechers (SKX), Home Depot (HD), Urban Outfitters (URBN), TJX (TJX), KB Home (KBH), Pagseguro Digital (PAGS), Citigroup (C), Navient (NAVI)\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe're nearing all time highs right now, so one of two things is going to happen after the beginning of the week in my opinion. I say we start the week green, we'll quickly get to the all time high levels and test. If we get lucky and orange man says something good about the trade talks, it could provide the lift we need to get over it and keep going. The other choice, is we either see consolidation like we did for two days last week, trade mostly sideways, teeter around, and pull back slightly before resuming upwards to test it again. I plan on being really mindful of my positions and at any sign of a sell off like the one that occurred a couple of weeks ago - I may go to cash and evaluate.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, and so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the thread. \n\n**Stocks I won't cover or comment on (because they're just too ridiculous):** This week, none\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Private Messages/Chat Requests:** I'll likely ignore most of these.

This should increase volatility regardless of what they are showing, but it happens to be all but confirmed that they will be showcasing Disney+ streaming platform.\n\nNow, this is not entirely revolutionary platform as they already have established ESPN+, but it provides strategic advantage to DIS as it will hold existing as well as potential content that competitors such as Apple, Netflix, CBS, etc cannot. And yes they have already announced plans to remove their existing content from Netflix. Personally, I have no idea why they are not presenting unified platform with all content or even piping all these services through Hulu (which they own majority stake in), but I suspect this is a future play for them.\n\nBased on AAPL announcement, stock rose 8% (month of March alone) and is continuing to go up (\\~12%). Apples compelling argument is bundling service packages. No content specific buzz that I am aware of as of now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEndGame (movie):\n\nRight off the bat, Avengers Endgame is already crushing records on presales and managed to cause outages on Fandango and AMC sites. I wasn't versed in how stock reacts to movie releases so I just looked at stock reaction after their major blockbusters released just to see if their is any correlation. I am choosing highest grossing blockbusters as my assumption is EndGame will easily fit in that category. I'd like to normalize numbers in a way that includes hype up to move as I believe a lot of the times stock price reacts well before movie is release, but this is what I'm going with for now.\n\n**Movie/Gross Earnings/Release Date/$DIS Stock Movement 2 Weeks After Release**\n\n* Star Wars Force Awakens / $247,966,675 / 12.18.15 / (-1%)\n* Black Panther / $202,003,951 / 2.16.18 / (+1%)\n* Avengers: Infinity War / $257,698,183 / 4.27.18 / (+3%)\n* Marvel's The Avengers / $207,438,708 / 5.4.12 / (+3%)\n* Star Wars The Last Jedi / $220,009,584 / 12.15.17 / (+3%)\n* Incredibles 2 / $182,687,905 / 6.15.18 / (+1%)\n\nBased on numbers, there is a slight lift. Not completely significant, but again my expectation is that End Game blows these records out of water. That and the combined news of streaming should move stock up significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCouple things to call out that I have not researched as much:\n\n* Park revenue: have not even looked into this in anyway\n* Q1 Guidance from DIS: they have already said Q1 earnings (May 8(?)) will be lower as they plan to invest in streaming platform\n* Movie net revenue: though I expect the new EndGame movie to crush gross income record, I also know they are floating around a $500M cost of making this one and the last one. Will probably look into net profit as an indicator next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know thoughts on this and anything else you think I should look into for analysis.\n\nEither way, I have no idea why stock is staying flat.

If you do decide to take these trades, I plan on getting into them as well. Trade at your own risk, **this is not investment advice, it's simply a transcription of my own notes that I'm willing to share.** *When I use the term YOLO play,* ***it doesn't necessarily mean FD's,*** because some tickers are light on option chains.

When you enter or exit a trade is your OWN DEAL. I cannot and will not give you advice on any of your own trades or positions. This is part of the learning process. Moreover, trading is about simply selling something for more than you bought it for. I don't have any hard and fast rules I follow, I simply do it by feel and intuition.\n\n# How My Picks Are Generated\n\nThese plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money. Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I played this harder than some of my other picks. It didn't do nearly as well as Bank of America early in the week, but overall, it did good. I'm still bullish on Twitter, and personally think it's busting out of some long term consolidation. It peaked almost 10% from the start of the week, my spreads worked out, I am personally holding a few longer termed contracts.\n\n**Gamestop (GME) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- So, they definitely ate shit on earnings, I sold half my contracts at open and the other half basically broke even because of IV. I wasn't looking to hold them and watch the company drive into the ground, made an okay profit, but I was hoping the bottom would fall out after earnings. Either way, the company is not looking well and is eventually going to 0 or getting acquired.\n\n**Aurora Cannabis (ACB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- This one didn't really work out for me. I've been averaging down anyway because I'm stubborn and I think it's going up, but, whatever - can't all be two and three baggers.\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Did exactly what I presumed it would. I'm not in any positions on this anymore, but it's staying on my radar. I expect financials to do well in the coming weeks, so I may randomly jump into it intraweek if I am feeling spicy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 8th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific plays are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each contract listed is not a suggestion to buy, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- This company is a gigantic mess. They set extremely high guidance for whatever reason last time around, and I highly doubt that they're going to meet it. Their margins are awful, and the only reason we'd see activists going after the board is if the inner workings of the company were crumbling. I'm playing this as an earnings play, I'm already in some puts for it, and plan on being in more depending where movement goes this week pre-earnings. Even if they do somehow magically rise off their call, I'm bag holding them. It seems that with poor earning calls, the stock moves violently, sometimes as much as 20%. Market makers seem to be pricing in about a $2 move, which to me, is reasonable, but it could move as much as $3-$3.50 in my opinion based on everything going on.\n\n* **Short term earnings YOLO: 4/18 $16.50 puts @ $0.37 or $15.50 puts @ $0.17**\n   * I'm likely not bag holding these past earnings more than a couple hours after open Thursday. The $15.50 puts is a complete lotto ticket, kind of the $16.50's too but after the last couple weeks I'm feeling spicy and I might decide to throw a couple hundred at it and see if we can reverse that massive gap up they had earlier this month. 10-bagger territory potential. I expect to take these to 0 if they beat earnings by some miracle.\n* **Longer term: 5/17 $16 puts @ $0.62 or $15 puts @ $0.38**\n   * Not sure what I'll do with either of these, depends on price action on Thursday after open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- They released some pretty killer news with their fuel costs potentially being flat, and even though they ran hard, I think it's got a ways longer to go. That news however is kind of concerning, almost as though to me they may be protecting against a bad earnings report. Either way, not enough for me to not bet on them. The stock trades at a very reasonable valuation, and they also don't have any 737 Max 8's in their fleet which kind of exempts them from being vulnerable to the production slowdowns Boeing just announced.\n\n* **YOLO: 4/12 $59 calls @ $0.60**\n   * IV is surprisingly low on these. Not sure why.\n* **Short term: 4/26 $61 calls @ $0.46**\n   * If earnings go well, I'd assume they continue climbing throughout the month, so bumping the strike a couple bucks seems reasonable for me.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $67.50 calls @ $0.22**\n   * I hold the same reasoning for potentially buying these as I do for the 4/26's, if they rise, and do well, they should keep rising on good guidance. Whether they can tack on all the way to expiration, idk, but there's probably a point I can find to exit these at a profit, and they're cheap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I'm still bullish on Twitter.

I'm more tempted to play here, honestly.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.81**\n   * If I play these, I'm going to be mindful around earnings, and perhaps manage this and jump out/in depending on any news/movement. If I'm really bullish, this would prove my position though huh\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** - So they said they're cutting production. Big whoop.

And yes they have already announced plans to remove their existing content from Netflix. Personally, I have no idea why they are not presenting unified platform with all content or even piping all these services through Hulu (which they own majority stake in), but I suspect this is a future play for them.\n\nBased on AAPL announcement, stock rose 8% (month of March alone) and is continuing to go up (\\~12%). Apples compelling argument is bundling service packages. No content specific buzz that I am aware of as of now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEndGame (movie):\n\nRight off the bat, Avengers Endgame is already crushing records on presales and managed to cause outages on Fandango and AMC sites. I wasn't versed in how stock reacts to movie releases so I just looked at stock reaction after their major blockbusters released just to see if their is any correlation. I am choosing highest grossing blockbusters as my assumption is EndGame will easily fit in that category. I'd like to normalize numbers in a way that includes hype up to move as I believe a lot of the times stock price reacts well before movie is release, but this is what I'm going with for now.\n\n**Movie/Gross Earnings/Release Date/$DIS Stock Movement 2 Weeks After Release**\n\n* Star Wars Force Awakens / $247,966,675 / 12.18.15 / (-1%)\n* Black Panther / $202,003,951 / 2.16.18 / (+1%)\n* Avengers: Infinity War / $257,698,183 / 4.27.18 / (+3%)\n* Marvel's The Avengers / $207,438,708 / 5.4.12 / (+3%)\n* Star Wars The Last Jedi / $220,009,584 / 12.15.17 / (+3%)\n* Incredibles 2 / $182,687,905 / 6.15.18 / (+1%)\n\nBased on numbers, there is a slight lift. Not completely significant, but again my expectation is that End Game blows these records out of water. That and the combined news of streaming should move stock up significantly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCouple things to call out that I have not researched as much:\n\n* Park revenue: have not even looked into this in anyway\n* Q1 Guidance from DIS: they have already said Q1 earnings (May 8(?)) will be lower as they plan to invest in streaming platform\n* Movie net revenue: though I expect the new EndGame movie to crush gross income record, I also know they are floating around a $500M cost of making this one and the last one. Will probably look into net profit as an indicator next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know thoughts on this and anything else you think I should look into for analysis.\n\nEither way, I have no idea why stock is staying flat.

It didn't do nearly as well as Bank of America early in the week, but overall, it did good. I'm still bullish on Twitter, and personally think it's busting out of some long term consolidation. It peaked almost 10% from the start of the week, my spreads worked out, I am personally holding a few longer termed contracts.\n\n**Gamestop (GME) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- So, they definitely ate shit on earnings, I sold half my contracts at open and the other half basically broke even because of IV. I wasn't looking to hold them and watch the company drive into the ground, made an okay profit, but I was hoping the bottom would fall out after earnings. Either way, the company is not looking well and is eventually going to 0 or getting acquired.\n\n**Aurora Cannabis (ACB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- This one didn't really work out for me. I've been averaging down anyway because I'm stubborn and I think it's going up, but, whatever - can't all be two and three baggers.\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Did exactly what I presumed it would. I'm not in any positions on this anymore, but it's staying on my radar. I expect financials to do well in the coming weeks, so I may randomly jump into it intraweek if I am feeling spicy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 8th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific plays are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each contract listed is not a suggestion to buy, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- This company is a gigantic mess. They set extremely high guidance for whatever reason last time around, and I highly doubt that they're going to meet it. Their margins are awful, and the only reason we'd see activists going after the board is if the inner workings of the company were crumbling. I'm playing this as an earnings play, I'm already in some puts for it, and plan on being in more depending where movement goes this week pre-earnings. Even if they do somehow magically rise off their call, I'm bag holding them. It seems that with poor earning calls, the stock moves violently, sometimes as much as 20%. Market makers seem to be pricing in about a $2 move, which to me, is reasonable, but it could move as much as $3-$3.50 in my opinion based on everything going on.\n\n* **Short term earnings YOLO: 4/18 $16.50 puts @ $0.37 or $15.50 puts @ $0.17**\n   * I'm likely not bag holding these past earnings more than a couple hours after open Thursday. The $15.50 puts is a complete lotto ticket, kind of the $16.50's too but after the last couple weeks I'm feeling spicy and I might decide to throw a couple hundred at it and see if we can reverse that massive gap up they had earlier this month. 10-bagger territory potential. I expect to take these to 0 if they beat earnings by some miracle.\n* **Longer term: 5/17 $16 puts @ $0.62 or $15 puts @ $0.38**\n   * Not sure what I'll do with either of these, depends on price action on Thursday after open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- They released some pretty killer news with their fuel costs potentially being flat, and even though they ran hard, I think it's got a ways longer to go. That news however is kind of concerning, almost as though to me they may be protecting against a bad earnings report. Either way, not enough for me to not bet on them. The stock trades at a very reasonable valuation, and they also don't have any 737 Max 8's in their fleet which kind of exempts them from being vulnerable to the production slowdowns Boeing just announced.\n\n* **YOLO: 4/12 $59 calls @ $0.60**\n   * IV is surprisingly low on these. Not sure why.\n* **Short term: 4/26 $61 calls @ $0.46**\n   * If earnings go well, I'd assume they continue climbing throughout the month, so bumping the strike a couple bucks seems reasonable for me.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $67.50 calls @ $0.22**\n   * I hold the same reasoning for potentially buying these as I do for the 4/26's, if they rise, and do well, they should keep rising on good guidance. Whether they can tack on all the way to expiration, idk, but there's probably a point I can find to exit these at a profit, and they're cheap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I'm still bullish on Twitter. Check out the last couple weeks of posts for the reasons. \n\n* **YOLO: 4/12 $35 calls @ $0.45**\n   * If I decide to enter these, I'm going to be really attentive and micromanage the position, averaging down and potentially exiting if it goes against me.\n* **Short term: 4/18 $35.5 calls @ $0.48**\n   * Giving up .50 of strike spread and paying only a few bucks for it seems reasonable. I'm more tempted to play here, honestly.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.81**\n   * If I play these, I'm going to be mindful around earnings, and perhaps manage this and jump out/in depending on any news/movement. If I'm really bullish, this would prove my position though huh\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** - So they said they're cutting production. Big whoop. They have piles of free cash flow, get a government contract every other week, and we've proven the $380 level to be pretty solid support. I imagine this claws it's way back to $400ish within a couple of weeks. For me, it's a true BTFD. I got lucky and cashed out debit spreads/calls on Friday morning so I didn't eat the downturn, either.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $397.5 calls**\n   * Probably micro managing these as well, just seems like they're so volatile there there could be a lot of building into the position/averaging the cost in order to see a solid profit here. I don't know the price because they gapped down like a mother fucker after hours on Friday.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $450 calls @ $2.22**\n   * This is the strike where it seems each $5 jump matters - these will likely be cheaper than listed, and offer a good chance. I don't plan on holding these until expiration unless the stock just explodes upward and I feel like I have enough cushion to sustain any bad news that may possibly come, although I still think the verdict is out and shit is priced in. I think the algo sell off on Friday will just rebound back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Snap (SNAP) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I know this sub loves to hate this stock, but I don't really care about their underlying business model. They also announced some semi-cool tech that will keep the white girls on the app longer on weekends, and it still stands as the easiest way to set up a way to chat to your mistress. Because of this -- they will likely survive just fine, even at a loss. The user base has to be worth something.\n\n* **ITM play: 4/12 $12 calls @ $0.26**\n   * I'm considering getting long shares and this seems like a decent price to pay to be able to watch and wait and see what happens this week.\n* **YOLO: 4/12 $12.50 calls @ $0.12 or $13 calls @ $0.06**\n   * They really don't have to go that far for these to profit and if there's any week they MIGHT rally through the recent gains, it would be this one.\n* **Long term: 5/24 $14 calls @ $0.44**\n   * Most likely not holding these to expiration, unless I see the type of run I'm expecting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Macy's (M) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I didn't post this one last week, but I definitely benefited off their run on Thursday and walked into it by luck because I was about to liquidate my calls I had, and then noticed they were running really hard. I think that it's poised to keep running this week for multiple reasons and the options are dirt cheap based on a few factors.\n\n* **Short term/YOLO: 4/18 $26 calls @ $0.39, 4/12 $25.5s @ $0.46 or 4/12 $26 @ $0.24**\n   * If I go back in on any of these (I had $24.50's this week I sold on Thursday) then I'm going to monitor this stock closely. It's been consolidating like none other and could really be poised to gain some back, more importantly, the company is valued reasonable, trading at a decent ratio, and the options are pretty cheap.\n* **Long term: 8/16 $30 calls @ $0.78**\n   * If my thesis is right and I decide to go this route, I'm likely holding them and just accepting what happens for the next few months because if the stock at any point tacks on a significant amount, they could really skyrocket in value.\n\n# My Current Project\n\nI'm thinking of streaming a small account challenge 3 days a week (Tues, Weds, Thurs) on Twitch (1k-&gt;50k). I don't know though, I'll let you know if anything comes of it and I decide to do it and if I do, mods will have to approve it first. It's working out alright thus far, and I don't do much trading on Robinhood so I figured I would do something with some YOLO bucks to see what I can do. Part of it is to prove that people don't need 25k to make money trading, PDT isn't holding people back, and there's ways to increase a small account quickly without as much risk as some people take. We'll see if this comes to fruition or not.\n\n# Stocks That Could Be Worth A Look\n\n**Bullish:** Hostess (TWNK), Cars dot com (CARS), Banco Bilbao (BBVA), Humana (HUM), Cypress Semi (CY), Nordstrom (JWN), Hanesbrands (HBI), Fox Corp (FOXA), American Eagle (AEO)\n\n**Bearish:** Skechers (SKX), Home Depot (HD), Urban Outfitters (URBN), TJX (TJX), KB Home (KBH), Pagseguro Digital (PAGS), Citigroup (C), Navient (NAVI)\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe're nearing all time highs right now, so one of two things is going to happen after the beginning of the week in my opinion. I say we start the week green, we'll quickly get to the all time high levels and test. If we get lucky and orange man says something good about the trade talks, it could provide the lift we need to get over it and keep going. The other choice, is we either see consolidation like we did for two days last week, trade mostly sideways, teeter around, and pull back slightly before resuming upwards to test it again. I plan on being really mindful of my positions and at any sign of a sell off like the one that occurred a couple of weeks ago - I may go to cash and evaluate.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, and so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the thread. \n\n**Stocks I won't cover or comment on (because they're just too ridiculous):** This week, none\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Private Messages/Chat Requests:** I'll likely ignore most of these. I got like four hundred last week? I trade during the day, so I can't be bothered to be responding thoughtfully when I have 15 charts on my screen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"), ("Beefcake!

I don't know though, I'll let you know if anything comes of it and I decide to do it and if I do, mods will have to approve it first. It's working out alright thus far, and I don't do much trading on Robinhood so I figured I would do something with some YOLO bucks to see what I can do. Part of it is to prove that people don't need 25k to make money trading, PDT isn't holding people back, and there's ways to increase a small account quickly without as much risk as some people take. We'll see if this comes to fruition or not.\n\n# Stocks That Could Be Worth A Look\n\n**Bullish:** Hostess (TWNK), Cars dot com (CARS), Banco Bilbao (BBVA), Humana (HUM), Cypress Semi (CY), Nordstrom (JWN), Hanesbrands (HBI), Fox Corp (FOXA), American Eagle (AEO)\n\n**Bearish:** Skechers (SKX), Home Depot (HD), Urban Outfitters (URBN), TJX (TJX), KB Home (KBH), Pagseguro Digital (PAGS), Citigroup (C), Navient (NAVI)\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe're nearing all time highs right now, so one of two things is going to happen after the beginning of the week in my opinion. I say we start the week green, we'll quickly get to the all time high levels and test. If we get lucky and orange man says something good about the trade talks, it could provide the lift we need to get over it and keep going. The other choice, is we either see consolidation like we did for two days last week, trade mostly sideways, teeter around, and pull back slightly before resuming upwards to test it again. I plan on being really mindful of my positions and at any sign of a sell off like the one that occurred a couple of weeks ago - I may go to cash and evaluate.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, and so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the thread. \n\n**Stocks I won't cover or comment on (because they're just too ridiculous):** This week, none\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Private Messages/Chat Requests:** I'll likely ignore most of these. I got like four hundred last week? I trade during the day, so I can't be bothered to be responding thoughtfully when I have 15 charts on my screen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"), ("Beefcake!

When you enter or exit a trade is your OWN DEAL. I cannot and will not give you advice on any of your own trades or positions. This is part of the learning process. Moreover, trading is about simply selling something for more than you bought it for. I don't have any hard and fast rules I follow, I simply do it by feel and intuition.\n\n# How My Picks Are Generated\n\nThese plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money. Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I played this harder than some of my other picks. It didn't do nearly as well as Bank of America early in the week, but overall, it did good. I'm still bullish on Twitter, and personally think it's busting out of some long term consolidation. It peaked almost 10% from the start of the week, my spreads worked out, I am personally holding a few longer termed contracts.\n\n**Gamestop (GME) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- So, they definitely ate shit on earnings, I sold half my contracts at open and the other half basically broke even because of IV. I wasn't looking to hold them and watch the company drive into the ground, made an okay profit, but I was hoping the bottom would fall out after earnings. Either way, the company is not looking well and is eventually going to 0 or getting acquired.\n\n**Aurora Cannabis (ACB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- This one didn't really work out for me. I've been averaging down anyway because I'm stubborn and I think it's going up, but, whatever - can't all be two and three baggers.\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Did exactly what I presumed it would. I'm not in any positions on this anymore, but it's staying on my radar. I expect financials to do well in the coming weeks, so I may randomly jump into it intraweek if I am feeling spicy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 8th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific plays are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each contract listed is not a suggestion to buy, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- This company is a gigantic mess. They set extremely high guidance for whatever reason last time around, and I highly doubt that they're going to meet it. Their margins are awful, and the only reason we'd see activists going after the board is if the inner workings of the company were crumbling. I'm playing this as an earnings play, I'm already in some puts for it, and plan on being in more depending where movement goes this week pre-earnings. Even if they do somehow magically rise off their call, I'm bag holding them. It seems that with poor earning calls, the stock moves violently, sometimes as much as 20%. Market makers seem to be pricing in about a $2 move, which to me, is reasonable, but it could move as much as $3-$3.50 in my opinion based on everything going on.\n\n* **Short term earnings YOLO: 4/18 $16.50 puts @ $0.37 or $15.50 puts @ $0.17**\n   * I'm likely not bag holding these past earnings more than a couple hours after open Thursday. The $15.50 puts is a complete lotto ticket, kind of the $16.50's too but after the last couple weeks I'm feeling spicy and I might decide to throw a couple hundred at it and see if we can reverse that massive gap up they had earlier this month. 10-bagger territory potential. I expect to take these to 0 if they beat earnings by some miracle.\n* **Longer term: 5/17 $16 puts @ $0.62 or $15 puts @ $0.38**\n   * Not sure what I'll do with either of these, depends on price action on Thursday after open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- They released some pretty killer news with their fuel costs potentially being flat, and even though they ran hard, I think it's got a ways longer to go. That news however is kind of concerning, almost as though to me they may be protecting against a bad earnings report. Either way, not enough for me to not bet on them. The stock trades at a very reasonable valuation, and they also don't have any 737 Max 8's in their fleet which kind of exempts them from being vulnerable to the production slowdowns Boeing just announced.\n\n* **YOLO: 4/12 $59 calls @ $0.60**\n   * IV is surprisingly low on these. Not sure why.\n* **Short term: 4/26 $61 calls @ $0.46**\n   * If earnings go well, I'd assume they continue climbing throughout the month, so bumping the strike a couple bucks seems reasonable for me.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $67.50 calls @ $0.22**\n   * I hold the same reasoning for potentially buying these as I do for the 4/26's, if they rise, and do well, they should keep rising on good guidance. Whether they can tack on all the way to expiration, idk, but there's probably a point I can find to exit these at a profit, and they're cheap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I'm still bullish on Twitter. Check out the last couple weeks of posts for the reasons. \n\n* **YOLO: 4/12 $35 calls @ $0.45**\n   * If I decide to enter these, I'm going to be really attentive and micromanage the position, averaging down and potentially exiting if it goes against me.\n* **Short term: 4/18 $35.5 calls @ $0.48**\n   * Giving up .50 of strike spread and paying only a few bucks for it seems reasonable. I'm more tempted to play here, honestly.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $41 calls @ $0.81**\n   * If I play these, I'm going to be mindful around earnings, and perhaps manage this and jump out/in depending on any news/movement. If I'm really bullish, this would prove my position though huh\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** - So they said they're cutting production. Big whoop. They have piles of free cash flow, get a government contract every other week, and we've proven the $380 level to be pretty solid support. I imagine this claws it's way back to $400ish within a couple of weeks. For me, it's a true BTFD. I got lucky and cashed out debit spreads/calls on Friday morning so I didn't eat the downturn, either.\n\n* **Short term: 4/18 $397.5 calls**\n   * Probably micro managing these as well, just seems like they're so volatile there there could be a lot of building into the position/averaging the cost in order to see a solid profit here. I don't know the price because they gapped down like a mother fucker after hours on Friday.\n* **Long term: 6/21 $450 calls @ $2.22**\n   * This is the strike where it seems each $5 jump matters - these will likely be cheaper than listed, and offer a good chance. I don't plan on holding these until expiration unless the stock just explodes upward and I feel like I have enough cushion to sustain any bad news that may possibly come, although I still think the verdict is out and shit is priced in. I think the algo sell off on Friday will just rebound back up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Snap (SNAP) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- I know this sub loves to hate this stock, but I don't really care about their underlying business model. They also announced some semi-cool tech that will keep the white girls on the app longer on weekends, and it still stands as the easiest way to set up a way to chat to your mistress. Because of this -- they will likely survive just fine, even at a loss.

Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market last week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 15th, 2019.\n\n# **Some optimistic corporate outlooks in the week ahead could lift the stock market to a record  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/12/get-ready-for-companies-to-tell-you-more-about-the-economy.html)**\n*****\n&gt; It’s now up to corporate America to reveal whether the U.S. economy simply hit a soft patch this winter, as many suspect, or is on the verge of falling into an even deeper rut.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings from a broad swath of industries, like financials, technology, transportation and consumer products roll out in the coming week as the first-quarter earnings season gets underway. According to Refinitiv, earnings are expected to decline 2.3 percent in the first negative quarter in three years, but it is business leaders’ comments on the future outlook that are even more important.\n*****\n&gt; Commentary and guidance is always a big deal, but this quarter it is critical. Analysts do not agree on whether the first quarter earnings season represents the trough, or even whether the second quarter will see a gain or decline in profit growth.\n*****\n&gt; At the same time, economic data, like March’s jobs report, are beginning to turn more positive, and first quarter growth has quickly gone from forecasts of nearly flattish back in January to now around 2%, on the back of better March releases. The economic data has been uneven, in part because of the government shutdown, but it has yet to prove the economy is back on track.\n*****\n&gt; “The market has been very sensitive to data that’s been picking up. The market is reflecting that, even though there’s talk of an earnings recession. What you don’t want is an earnings recession leading to an economic recession. If companies believe there’s a major downturn in revenue growth, they stop spending and ultimately they fire people and that leads to a recession,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.\n*****\n&gt; The stock market is also at an important inflection point, with the major indexes closing in on all-time highs. The S&amp;P 500 pressed through 2,900 Friday, seen as a point of psychological resistance. The S&amp;P ended the week at 2,907, for a weekly gain of 0.5%. The next target traders are watching is the closing high 2,930 on the S&amp;P. The all-time high was an intraday 2,940, reached on Sept. 21.\n*****\n&gt; Earnings season got off to a good start with J.P. Morgan Chase’s quarterly earnings report Friday. CEO Jamie Dimon was very positive, saying the U.S. economy’s expansion “could go on for years.”\n*****\n&gt; “If you look at the American economy, the consumer is in good shape, balance sheets are in good shape, people are going back to the workforce, companies have plenty of capital,” Dimon told analysts during a conference call. J.P. Morgan stock rose sharply, after its record profits beat analysts’ expectations.\n*****\n&gt; “Positive guidance, that’s what the market needs. [The S&amp;P] could cross 2,900, but then again it could pull back,” said Krosby, but she said the momentum has been pointing higher. “The market has basically been endorsing 2,900 and beyond.”\n*****\n&gt; Krosby said important upcoming economic reports include Empire State and Philadelphia Fed surveys Monday and Thursday respectively, for a current look at manufacturing activity in New York and the Mid-Atlantic region. There is also industrial production and retail sales Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; “Jobs data was strong. Everybody was really negative on the economy, and now we’re getting pleasant surprises,” said Marc Chandler, Bannockburn Global Forex chief market strategist. The economy added 196,000 jobs in March, bringing the monthly average to 180,000 over the past three months, even with February’s shockingly low 33,000 payrolls.\n*****\n&gt; Chandler said industrial production and other data should show an improved trend over last month.\n*****\n&gt; As stocks have shaken off growth fears, bond yields have also moved higher. The 10-year Treasury note was yielding 2.55% Friday, well above the lows of 2.34% reached on March 28.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://finviz.com/publish/041219/sec_all_w1_173223326.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/bTR4L0w.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/gFrOIB2.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/G83UM3g.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/pwyn0Ng.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zqiOyQk.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AupfSGV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8OCC1LQ.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/k261h7u.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4cMhMGZ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zqydCfr.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/YRS4OHb.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical April Trading: Mid-Month Surge Stronger Second Half\n\n&gt; Over the recent 21 years April is the top-ranked month for DJIA. April ranks #3 S&amp;P 500, #5 for NASDAQ, #2 for Russell 1000 and #4 for Russell 2000. Average gains over the period range from a low of 1.19% by NASDAQ to a respectable 2.29% by DJIA. The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. In fact the second half of April is stronger over the recent 21-year period.\n\n&gt; Early April trading is usually positive for the first 4 days then flattens off until mid-month. Then the market tends to surge from the tenth to the fifteenth trading days. DJIA tends to close out the month strongest with NASDAQ closing weakest.\n\n&gt; Except for DJIA weighed down by Boeing (BA), stocks are having an above average month so far, which is quite typical in Pre-Election years where April has tended to be even stronger.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eeb28454921d52ecd051d64904659304/tumblr_inline_pprlh3o8X51spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Claims Bode Well For Equities\n\n&gt; Earlier today on our Twitter account, we retweeted a chart from Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal of inverted Jobless Claims versus the S&amp;P 500. We have used this chart as an argument for the bullish case for the past several years. As we mentioned in a blog post this morning, Initial Jobless Claims came in earlier this week with a sizable drop off, down to 196K versus last week's revised 204K and expectations of 210K. This week's print was not only a new low for the current cycle, it is also the lowest reading since 1969. That sort of new low could be a good sign for equities. As shown in the chart below, claims and the S&amp;P have mirrored each other since bottoming following the financial crisis. (In the chart, we have inverted claims on the right axis.) As the S&amp;P 500 inches its way back towards all time highs, so has claims towards new lows. Additionally, with recent low prints for claims bucking what had previously appeared to be an upside trend reversal, the bullish case for the S&amp;P 500 is growing.\n\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-Claims-vs-SP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Optimism Growing Again\n\n&gt; The American Association of Individual Investors updated their weekly investor sentiment survey this morning and the results are very similar to the final days of February with bullish sentiment around 40%, bearish down near 20%, and neutral once again in the upper 30's. Up from 35.02% last week, bullish sentiment has crossed back over the 40% threshold; the first time it has done so since the previously mentioned week in February. While bullish sentiment is sitting a couple of points above the historical average, this is still several percentage points from reaching any sort of extreme level (more than one standard deviation above the aforementioned average). For that to happen, bullish sentiment would have to come in above 48.36%. If that occurs, then it could be a sign that investors are getting a little too optimistic.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Bullish-Sentiment.png))**\n\n&gt; Bearish sentiment, on the other hand, fell all the way back down to 20.38% this week, the lowest since its 20% reading on February 28th. That is around 10% less than the historical average for bearish sentiment. That is also at the lower end of the range bearish sentiment has stayed within in the past decade.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Bearish-Sentiment.png))**\n\n&gt; Neutral sentiment has still yet to have moved above or below the upper 30's coming in at 39.33% this week after falling from similar levels down to 36.71% last week. That is the third time in the past month that neutral sentiment has come in between 39% and 40%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/041119-AAII-Neutral-Sentiment.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The December Low Indicator Has Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; After the best first quarter for the S&amp;P 500 Index since 1998, the big question is: What happens next? We’ve already discussed why a good start to a year could lead to more gains (here and here), but today we will take a look at another potentially positive signal.\n\n&gt; The December Low Indicator was created in the 1970s by Lucien Hooper, a former Forbes columnist and Wall Street analyst. Simply put, the indicator says that if the S&amp;P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter, it’s a warning sign for potential weakness over the balance of the year. The flipside is if it doesn’t, good times could be coming. Given the S&amp;P 500 just went all of the first quarter without closing beneath the December 24 low, it’s worth taking a deeper dive.\n\n&gt; Sure enough, there appears to be some truth to this concept. “The December low indicator seems quite simple, but it has a tremendous track record,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “When the S&amp;P 500 stays above the December lows throughout the first quarter, the full year has been higher an incredible 34 out of the last 34 times, which bodes well for 2019.” In fact, this warning even worked last year, as it triggered in the first quarter of 2018 and eventually played out during the big fourth quarter sell-off.\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, when the S&amp;P 500 stays above the December lows in the first quarter, the full year does quite well.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SP500-Index-Yearly-Returns-Nased-on-the-December-Low-Indicator-1950-2018.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for April 12th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEhWMqLZI7U))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Are Stocks Going UP Next Week? | Earnings Season Kick-Off! | ShadowTrader Video 04.14.19** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgZML4jp_WI))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$GS** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$APHA** \n&gt; * **$PIXY** \n&gt; * **$SCHW** \n&gt; * **$MTB** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$IBM** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$MS** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$BLK** \n&gt; * **$CMA** \n&gt; * **$TEAM** \n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$KMI** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$URI** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$WIT** \n&gt; * **$KSU** \n&gt; * **$UAL** \n&gt; * **$PLD** \n&gt; * **$ASML** \n&gt; * **$USB** \n&gt; * **$BK** \n&gt; * **$TXT** \n&gt; * **$FHN** \n&gt; * **$JBHT** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$PNFP** \n&gt; * **$PIR** \n&gt; * **$LVS** \n&gt; * **$MLNX** \n&gt; * **$MBWM** \n&gt; * **$CCI** \n&gt; * **$SKX** \n&gt; * **$BMI**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/k261h7u.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ufAr02D.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY MORNING'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/y3e9UCK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/ZpBOUvY.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.15.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qvpkZGr.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 4.15.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/a4cvbJc.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.16.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZSb5io4.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 4.16.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/i604cgq.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.17.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uaWkXIX.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 4.17.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cykytC9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.18.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nN/A.\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 4.18.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nN/A.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 4.19.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

That being said -- I got kind of fucked on my own positions by posting the exact trades I planned on taking. Contrary to popular belief, the strikes weren't removed because I was worried about liability, but because my personal entries got inflated, and one of the trades returned 35% that should have returned 90% or more. Unfortunately, I'm not listing my exact strikes or dates because they shouldn't even be pertinent to you. The strikes I pick are based on if I hold long shares in any of the companies, but as well based on my liquidity, risk tolerance, and my personal allocation per play. You should learn that stuff on your own, to be frank.\n\n# How I Pick Plays For Myself\n\nThese plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nI have some things in the works. I'm still working on the small account challenge, and some other things. I don't really like, nor use Twitter, but I may start one so you can get updates on it elsewhere, we'll see. I have a couple other things in the pipeline, so if you want to know more about them, feel free to message me. I don't want to make this post about my ventures outside of here. Let's get to fucking betting bois.\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Company is shit, just like I thought. They beat earnings but as I said last week, I had both FD's and May/Junes. The May/Junes I'm bagholding like Michael Burry because I just don't believe in it. They beat EPS estimates but as some of you saw me post, the company is just flat out shit. The things I already knew came to light, their balance sheet is wacked and they're predicting low single digit long term growth (IE: inflation anybody?). I'll probably sell them and roll them in the upcoming days because I really think this stocks going to pull a JCPenny, hopefully before July. The short float's still insane, so it may Roku out and rebound, we'll see.\n\n**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Definitely beat earnings like I thought they would, they're not exposed to the Boeing stuff, and unfortunately, they couldn't hold the big gains and we saw some profit taking from shareholders. After consolidation, I would assume they continue to rise, so I have May contracts still -- and I plan on watching and deciding what to do here. I sold some of them right at open for 50%.\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH***  \\- Twitter had high points and low points, the market was really a sideways clusterfuck all week except for some segments, but I found a couple good entries and made a couple profitable trades on it still. Had two go completely to zero, though.\n\n**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- They already started their claw back to 400+. Enough said here, I don't think it's surprising, at all. If it wasn't for Boeing's drop, Dow would be at all time highs nearly.\n\n**Snap (SNAP) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Well, those people still holding puts from months ago probably hate this stock more than ever. Until it hits 17, I don't see it slowing down. It pulled back pretty hard after it rose, and it may still, but I wouldn't try to time its pullbacks.\n\n**Macy's (M) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Yo fuck this stock for real. I made a pile on it a week or so ago when it crested 26, and I really thought it was done with this gain/give back consolidate shit. Wednesday I bought 24.50 puts at right as it broke down after open, and they paid well. I also had 24's that went to 0. I'm done playing this stock until it shows some balls and conviction.\n\n# Let's Talk Entries/Exits\n\nOkay boys and girls, I'm going to do some educating really quickly.\n\nIn your day to day trading if you act on emotion: Stop.\n\nIf you see a stock shoot up 5% after open and you FOMO it and it's been 10 minutes since the bell rang: Stop.\n\nIf you didn't play Disney: You should have.\n\nIf you decide to do some investigating and pick plays to make this week, don't feel obligated to open your positions Monday first thing. Likewise, you should never really open positions within the first 15-20 minutes of trading for a day. It's likely (like with SPY often) that the peak it achieves during open will be the biggest swing you will see for the day, and it's likely there's the least conviction behind it.\n\nWhen I pick an entry point, I look at the trend I'm following, I look at the stock, I decide where I think it can reach, what I'm willing to bet that it does, and what kind of swing I'm playing for.\n\nThis brings me to earnings season: Normally, I'm looking to get into positions at least a week before an earnings report because I'm taking on a vega advantageous position (the increase in it, specifically), but I had bad planning that week.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, none of that matters this week. **BECAUSE ITS EARNINGS SEASON LETS** ***GOOOOOOOOOOOO.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 15th, 2019 [EARNINGS TIME]\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**\n\nThis week I'm changing up how I do this. I'm offering the info that I see pertinent to the play I plan on making and if somebody decides to do their own DD and makes a similar trade, I won't always get dicked on my entries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) - $30.17 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report on Tuesday before open.** At this point, for me to bet against the banks it'd take a lot of conviction that a certain bank has a certain problem they can't overcome. People are borrowing like crazy still, we saw how strong the entire sector was Friday, and although Bank of America's been on a tear as of late I still think it has potential to really break above a long time range it's been stuck in. They popped hard on the other financial reports, but I don't think that diminishes their possibility to go further. They may correct in the day before earnings, so I'm going to look hard for a good entry. Market \n\n* **Expected Move - $1.04** \\- I think this is low. I think we can see a $1.50 move on earnings day, and I think that as long as orange man doesn't say stupid shit, we can probably tack on another 1-2% the rest of the week.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ2 18 $28.55 -&gt; $29.78\n   * FQ4 18 $26.55 -&gt; $28.45 \n* **52 Week High: $31.91 -** This is important, because it's approaching a point where if it can get past this, we may see new money flood in and help push it higher. It all depends on volume and conviction though.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at FD's and longer dated calls on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Atlassian (TEAM) - $112.68 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report on Wednesday after close.** One of my businesses is a large scale development project, we have roughly 10 devs/designers/team members. We've been using Atlassian products for like 7 years. Every time something else pops out that integrates cleanly, we try it, often buy it. They've been getting subscriptions from me forever, and I'm grandfathered into a good plan on one of them. The fact is their culture/infrastructure/family of products pulls you in and doesn't let you go. Knowing a lot about the company personally, having a lot of experience with it and knowing how crucial it is to so many people, I assume their churn rate is pretty low historically/projected to stay low. This company is really on the come up. I'm bullish.\n\n* **Expected Move - $9.86** \\- They're a growing company and each time they prove it, they gain hand over fist. This might be exuberant -- but I really do think they have potential to become a $200 stock in the next 12 months.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ1 18 $40.25 -&gt; $50.17 (25% HELLOOOO)\n   * FQ4 18 $66.83 -&gt; $73.84\n   * FQ1 19 $81.89 -&gt; $70.18 (by 11/28, a month later, it was exploding back above this price and basically fucking ignored the December selloff)\n* **52 Week High: $116.70 -** It solidly retraced its December lows back upwards, and has hesitated barely, with the regular gain/consolidate pattern upwards. I don't think it's slowing down.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at calls both FD's for the earnings move and Junes at a wide spread apart. I'm going to give the long dated ones room to play as a lotto ticket for as cheap as I can get them and assume the trend continues, and play the FD's for at least a 200% gain based on the move that is priced in being smaller than I think they'll gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Netflix (NFLX) - $351.14** ***- BEARISH*** \\- **They report on Tuesday after close.** So, Netflix is a touchy subject for me. I've bet against them twice, and lost heavily on both plays. I bet for them, and lost both also. I basically was backwards both times. While I think they appropriately guided last time based on them saying most growth would be international for their last quarter, I think that Disney's meteoric rise on Friday followed by them losing 4.5% was an indication of the multiple this stock trades at -- and sentiment that people really think that Disney is a challenger. Once Apple actually announces their streaming specifics, I think they will be a contender also. That being said, I think a lot of people are of the belief that there is room for everyone, and while that's true, I see inevitable growth slowing with Netflix over the next two years because of the other companies entering the market. Not negative growth, but a curb of their exponential growth, and the need to spend more to acquire -- means lower EPS. I don't think the company will necessarily ever really fall to #2 in the department, but I think the stock is pretty overvalued right now unless they find a means to leverage their subscribers for more money. They can only raise prices so often though.\n\nThat all being said - once again, the entire economic situation seemed dire last quarter -- but I think of it this way: People knew that they weren't cancelling Netflix. You may buy less cars, you buy cheaper toilet paper, you don't cancel Netflix, because most people that come home from their shit job or tough day need it. They live for it. I don't think the economic situation really affects this company, and thus, they're at a PE of fucking 140. How far can this company really go? Can they get a billion subscribers? I just don't see that happening, I really don't.\n\nThey're also going to shell out $3 BILLION DOLLARS this year. That's almost double 2016, and a billion over 2017. That's a lot of dough man, and if their growth isn't still exponential, how do they plan to start increasing their free cash flow. It's on a downward spiral, so what's the deal? They just stop paying for content? Can't. Management says they will, but how the fuck will you keep the buzz going for the service with the introduction of two competitors? New people to streaming won't just automatically buy Netflix now, Disney or Apple may be the first stop. Stop advertising? Maybe, but that's probably a fraction of what they spend on infrastructure and content.\n\nLong story short, I'm betting against them in two ways.\n\n* **Expected Move - $25.30** \\- It could be way more, or way less than this. They may give away 10% and rally it back in two days. This stocks just so volatile around their earnings reports.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ2 17 $161.70 -&gt; $183.60\n   * FQ4 17 $227.58 -&gt; $250.29\n   * FQ2 18 $400.48 -&gt; $379.48\n   * FQ4 18 $351.39 -&gt; $339.10\n* **52 Week High: $423.21 -** This stocks just really overvalued in my opinion. I understand their subs are worth something but I think before it gets back here, it's going to trace back below $300 at some point.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm playing one or two at the money contracts on this probably, and maybe a way OTM straddle in May, but I'm not sure. It takes serious balls to bet against this stock, and it takes serious balls to play it period because the options are definitely appropriately priced, if not over priced, and it's a way to just light a bunch of fucking money on fire. It's earnings season though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EA (EA) - $101.83** ***- BULLISH*** \\- **They report on 5/7/19 after close.** I'm looking to start setting up some multi-leg and long term plays here. The fact of the matter is, I play Apex occasionally. I hate battle royale games, but I fucking love that game. My friends and I get fucked up and play once a week or so after we all get done working/with meetings. There is almost no chance they thought this game would blow up like it has, and regardless of the pull back in Twitch viewership, Apex did in 4 weeks what took Fortnite 16. Obviously, they share player bases, but I don't think it matters. Games cycle through this industry, and it's gone from PUBG, to H1Z1, to Fortnite, and I think Apex will continue making the company more money in the first year than they forecasted.\n\n* **My Target For Lotto's - $130-$140 by September** \\- They could hit this mark in the weeks after earnings, even. I think we'll see a rise in the coming weeks, especially if the software sector pops or gets any good news.\n* **52 Week High: $151.26 -** Seems this sector has lagged a bit on the recovery from December. I think that speaks to the room it has to run. Not really betting against it, more kids are born every day, and they floss their way around the house when I'm at family functions. Fuck, when I was a kid I just put olives on my fingers and ate them.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm going to start accumulating cheap lotto options in big lots, that are quite a ways out of the money. I plan to add to my position slowly, and then liquidate some near earnings if the move starts running my way. I'll probably buy some FD's for the earnings week expiration, the week before, and if all works out, roll it into shares or more calls and ride it as long as I can.\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe're approaching all time highs still and I'm pretty confident we'll be achieving them. Almost every company guided low for this quarter, and we're seeing slowly the economy wasn't nearly as bad as we thought. Evidence: Financial earnings on Friday. I think that we'll see a 3:1 or 4:1 beat/miss rate, and betting the upside during earnings this season is going to be pretty easy to profit. Doesn't mean I'm blindly yolo'ing the upside, but I'm definitely leaning that way if I'm ever on the fence. Unless it's Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. That company is shit.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\nEdit: Not doing this \n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the post.\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Private Messages/Chat Requests:**  Hit me up if you have questions.

That being said -- I got kind of fucked on my own positions by posting the exact trades I planned on taking. Contrary to popular belief, the strikes weren't removed because I was worried about liability, but because my personal entries got inflated, and one of the trades returned 35% that should have returned 90% or more. Unfortunately, I'm not listing my exact strikes or dates because they shouldn't even be pertinent to you. The strikes I pick are based on if I hold long shares in any of the companies, but as well based on my liquidity, risk tolerance, and my personal allocation per play. You should learn that stuff on your own, to be frank.\n\n# How I Pick Plays For Myself\n\nThese plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nI have some things in the works. I'm still working on the small account challenge, and some other things. I don't really like, nor use Twitter, but I may start one so you can get updates on it elsewhere, we'll see. I have a couple other things in the pipeline, so if you want to know more about them, feel free to message me. I don't want to make this post about my ventures outside of here. Let's get to fucking betting bois.\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Company is shit, just like I thought. They beat earnings but as I said last week, I had both FD's and May/Junes. The May/Junes I'm bagholding like Michael Burry because I just don't believe in it. They beat EPS estimates but as some of you saw me post, the company is just flat out shit. The things I already knew came to light, their balance sheet is wacked and they're predicting low single digit long term growth (IE: inflation anybody?). I'll probably sell them and roll them in the upcoming days because I really think this stocks going to pull a JCPenny, hopefully before July. The short float's still insane, so it may Roku out and rebound, we'll see.\n\n**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Definitely beat earnings like I thought they would, they're not exposed to the Boeing stuff, and unfortunately, they couldn't hold the big gains and we saw some profit taking from shareholders. After consolidation, I would assume they continue to rise, so I have May contracts still -- and I plan on watching and deciding what to do here. I sold some of them right at open for 50%.\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH***  \\- Twitter had high points and low points, the market was really a sideways clusterfuck all week except for some segments, but I found a couple good entries and made a couple profitable trades on it still. Had two go completely to zero, though.\n\n**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- They already started their claw back to 400+. Enough said here, I don't think it's surprising, at all. If it wasn't for Boeing's drop, Dow would be at all time highs nearly.\n\n**Snap (SNAP) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Well, those people still holding puts from months ago probably hate this stock more than ever. Until it hits 17, I don't see it slowing down. It pulled back pretty hard after it rose, and it may still, but I wouldn't try to time its pullbacks.\n\n**Macy's (M) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Yo fuck this stock for real. I made a pile on it a week or so ago when it crested 26, and I really thought it was done with this gain/give back consolidate shit. Wednesday I bought 24.50 puts at right as it broke down after open, and they paid well. I also had 24's that went to 0.

There is almost no chance they thought this game would blow up like it has, and regardless of the pull back in Twitch viewership, Apex did in 4 weeks what took Fortnite 16. Obviously, they share player bases, but I don't think it matters. Games cycle through this industry, and it's gone from PUBG, to H1Z1, to Fortnite, and I think Apex will continue making the company more money in the first year than they forecasted.\n\n* **My Target For Lotto's - $130-$140 by September** \\- They could hit this mark in the weeks after earnings, even. I think we'll see a rise in the coming weeks, especially if the software sector pops or gets any good news.\n* **52 Week High: $151.26 -** Seems this sector has lagged a bit on the recovery from December. I think that speaks to the room it has to run. Not really betting against it, more kids are born every day, and they floss their way around the house when I'm at family functions. Fuck, when I was a kid I just put olives on my fingers and ate them.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm going to start accumulating cheap lotto options in big lots, that are quite a ways out of the money. I plan to add to my position slowly, and then liquidate some near earnings if the move starts running my way. I'll probably buy some FD's for the earnings week expiration, the week before, and if all works out, roll it into shares or more calls and ride it as long as I can.\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe're approaching all time highs still and I'm pretty confident we'll be achieving them. Almost every company guided low for this quarter, and we're seeing slowly the economy wasn't nearly as bad as we thought. Evidence: Financial earnings on Friday. I think that we'll see a 3:1 or 4:1 beat/miss rate, and betting the upside during earnings this season is going to be pretty easy to profit. Doesn't mean I'm blindly yolo'ing the upside, but I'm definitely leaning that way if I'm ever on the fence. Unless it's Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. That company is shit.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\nEdit: Not doing this \n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the post.\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Private Messages/Chat Requests:**  Hit me up if you have questions.

That being said -- I got kind of fucked on my own positions by posting the exact trades I planned on taking. Contrary to popular belief, the strikes weren't removed because I was worried about liability, but because my personal entries got inflated, and one of the trades returned 35% that should have returned 90% or more. Unfortunately, I'm not listing my exact strikes or dates because they shouldn't even be pertinent to you. The strikes I pick are based on if I hold long shares in any of the companies, but as well based on my liquidity, risk tolerance, and my personal allocation per play. You should learn that stuff on your own, to be frank.\n\n# How I Pick Plays For Myself\n\nThese plays are found using my own scanner criteria across a variety of metrics depending on market conditions. Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won't divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it's high and buy IV when it's low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don't want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low's and high's, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nI have some things in the works. I'm still working on the small account challenge, and some other things. I don't really like, nor use Twitter, but I may start one so you can get updates on it elsewhere, we'll see. I have a couple other things in the pipeline, so if you want to know more about them, feel free to message me. I don't want to make this post about my ventures outside of here. Let's get to fucking betting bois.\n\n# Results On Last Week's Picks\n\n**Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Company is shit, just like I thought. They beat earnings but as I said last week, I had both FD's and May/Junes. The May/Junes I'm bagholding like Michael Burry because I just don't believe in it. They beat EPS estimates but as some of you saw me post, the company is just flat out shit. The things I already knew came to light, their balance sheet is wacked and they're predicting low single digit long term growth (IE: inflation anybody?). I'll probably sell them and roll them in the upcoming days because I really think this stocks going to pull a JCPenny, hopefully before July. The short float's still insane, so it may Roku out and rebound, we'll see.\n\n**Delta Airline (DAL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Definitely beat earnings like I thought they would, they're not exposed to the Boeing stuff, and unfortunately, they couldn't hold the big gains and we saw some profit taking from shareholders. After consolidation, I would assume they continue to rise, so I have May contracts still -- and I plan on watching and deciding what to do here. I sold some of them right at open for 50%.\n\n**Twitter (TWTR) -** ***BULLISH***  \\- Twitter had high points and low points, the market was really a sideways clusterfuck all week except for some segments, but I found a couple good entries and made a couple profitable trades on it still. Had two go completely to zero, though.\n\n**Boeing (BA) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- They already started their claw back to 400+. Enough said here, I don't think it's surprising, at all. If it wasn't for Boeing's drop, Dow would be at all time highs nearly.\n\n**Snap (SNAP) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Well, those people still holding puts from months ago probably hate this stock more than ever. Until it hits 17, I don't see it slowing down. It pulled back pretty hard after it rose, and it may still, but I wouldn't try to time its pullbacks.\n\n**Macy's (M) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Yo fuck this stock for real. I made a pile on it a week or so ago when it crested 26, and I really thought it was done with this gain/give back consolidate shit. Wednesday I bought 24.50 puts at right as it broke down after open, and they paid well. I also had 24's that went to 0. I'm done playing this stock until it shows some balls and conviction.\n\n# Let's Talk Entries/Exits\n\nOkay boys and girls, I'm going to do some educating really quickly.\n\nIn your day to day trading if you act on emotion: Stop.\n\nIf you see a stock shoot up 5% after open and you FOMO it and it's been 10 minutes since the bell rang: Stop.\n\nIf you didn't play Disney: You should have.\n\nIf you decide to do some investigating and pick plays to make this week, don't feel obligated to open your positions Monday first thing. Likewise, you should never really open positions within the first 15-20 minutes of trading for a day. It's likely (like with SPY often) that the peak it achieves during open will be the biggest swing you will see for the day, and it's likely there's the least conviction behind it.\n\nWhen I pick an entry point, I look at the trend I'm following, I look at the stock, I decide where I think it can reach, what I'm willing to bet that it does, and what kind of swing I'm playing for.\n\nThis brings me to earnings season: Normally, I'm looking to get into positions at least a week before an earnings report because I'm taking on a vega advantageous position (the increase in it, specifically), but I had bad planning that week.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, none of that matters this week. **BECAUSE ITS EARNINGS SEASON LETS** ***GOOOOOOOOOOOO.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 15th, 2019 [EARNINGS TIME]\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**\n\nThis week I'm changing up how I do this. I'm offering the info that I see pertinent to the play I plan on making and if somebody decides to do their own DD and makes a similar trade, I won't always get dicked on my entries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) - $30.17 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report on Tuesday before open.** At this point, for me to bet against the banks it'd take a lot of conviction that a certain bank has a certain problem they can't overcome. People are borrowing like crazy still, we saw how strong the entire sector was Friday, and although Bank of America's been on a tear as of late I still think it has potential to really break above a long time range it's been stuck in. They popped hard on the other financial reports, but I don't think that diminishes their possibility to go further. They may correct in the day before earnings, so I'm going to look hard for a good entry. Market \n\n* **Expected Move - $1.04** \\- I think this is low. I think we can see a $1.50 move on earnings day, and I think that as long as orange man doesn't say stupid shit, we can probably tack on another 1-2% the rest of the week.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ2 18 $28.55 -&gt; $29.78\n   * FQ4 18 $26.55 -&gt; $28.45 \n* **52 Week High: $31.91 -** This is important, because it's approaching a point where if it can get past this, we may see new money flood in and help push it higher. It all depends on volume and conviction though.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at FD's and longer dated calls on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Atlassian (TEAM) - $112.68 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report on Wednesday after close.** One of my businesses is a large scale development project, we have roughly 10 devs/designers/team members. We've been using Atlassian products for like 7 years. Every time something else pops out that integrates cleanly, we try it, often buy it. They've been getting subscriptions from me forever, and I'm grandfathered into a good plan on one of them. The fact is their culture/infrastructure/family of products pulls you in and doesn't let you go. Knowing a lot about the company personally, having a lot of experience with it and knowing how crucial it is to so many people, I assume their churn rate is pretty low historically/projected to stay low. This company is really on the come up. I'm bullish.\n\n* **Expected Move - $9.86** \\- They're a growing company and each time they prove it, they gain hand over fist. This might be exuberant -- but I really do think they have potential to become a $200 stock in the next 12 months.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ1 18 $40.25 -&gt; $50.17 (25% HELLOOOO)\n   * FQ4 18 $66.83 -&gt; $73.84\n   * FQ1 19 $81.89 -&gt; $70.18 (by 11/28, a month later, it was exploding back above this price and basically fucking ignored the December selloff)\n* **52 Week High: $116.70 -** It solidly retraced its December lows back upwards, and has hesitated barely, with the regular gain/consolidate pattern upwards. I don't think it's slowing down.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at calls both FD's for the earnings move and Junes at a wide spread apart. I'm going to give the long dated ones room to play as a lotto ticket for as cheap as I can get them and assume the trend continues, and play the FD's for at least a 200% gain based on the move that is priced in being smaller than I think they'll gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Netflix (NFLX) - $351.14** ***- BEARISH*** \\- **They report on Tuesday after close.** So, Netflix is a touchy subject for me. I've bet against them twice, and lost heavily on both plays. I bet for them, and lost both also. I basically was backwards both times. While I think they appropriately guided last time based on them saying most growth would be international for their last quarter, I think that Disney's meteoric rise on Friday followed by them losing 4.5% was an indication of the multiple this stock trades at -- and sentiment that people really think that Disney is a challenger. Once Apple actually announces their streaming specifics, I think they will be a contender also. That being said, I think a lot of people are of the belief that there is room for everyone, and while that's true, I see inevitable growth slowing with Netflix over the next two years because of the other companies entering the market. Not negative growth, but a curb of their exponential growth, and the need to spend more to acquire -- means lower EPS. I don't think the company will necessarily ever really fall to #2 in the department, but I think the stock is pretty overvalued right now unless they find a means to leverage their subscribers for more money. They can only raise prices so often though.\n\nThat all being said - once again, the entire economic situation seemed dire last quarter -- but I think of it this way: People knew that they weren't cancelling Netflix. You may buy less cars, you buy cheaper toilet paper, you don't cancel Netflix, because most people that come home from their shit job or tough day need it. They live for it. I don't think the economic situation really affects this company, and thus, they're at a PE of fucking 140. How far can this company really go? Can they get a billion subscribers? I just don't see that happening, I really don't.\n\nThey're also going to shell out $3 BILLION DOLLARS this year. That's almost double 2016, and a billion over 2017. That's a lot of dough man, and if their growth isn't still exponential, how do they plan to start increasing their free cash flow. It's on a downward spiral, so what's the deal? They just stop paying for content? Can't. Management says they will, but how the fuck will you keep the buzz going for the service with the introduction of two competitors? New people to streaming won't just automatically buy Netflix now, Disney or Apple may be the first stop. Stop advertising? Maybe, but that's probably a fraction of what they spend on infrastructure and content.\n\nLong story short, I'm betting against them in two ways.\n\n* **Expected Move - $25.30** \\- It could be way more, or way less than this. They may give away 10% and rally it back in two days. This stocks just so volatile around their earnings reports.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ2 17 $161.70 -&gt; $183.60\n   * FQ4 17 $227.58 -&gt; $250.29\n   * FQ2 18 $400.48 -&gt; $379.48\n   * FQ4 18 $351.39 -&gt; $339.10\n* **52 Week High: $423.21 -** This stocks just really overvalued in my opinion. I understand their subs are worth something but I think before it gets back here, it's going to trace back below $300 at some point.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm playing one or two at the money contracts on this probably, and maybe a way OTM straddle in May, but I'm not sure. It takes serious balls to bet against this stock, and it takes serious balls to play it period because the options are definitely appropriately priced, if not over priced, and it's a way to just light a bunch of fucking money on fire. It's earnings season though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EA (EA) - $101.83** ***- BULLISH*** \\- **They report on 5/7/19 after close.** I'm looking to start setting up some multi-leg and long term plays here. The fact of the matter is, I play Apex occasionally. I hate battle royale games, but I fucking love that game. My friends and I get fucked up and play once a week or so after we all get done working/with meetings. There is almost no chance they thought this game would blow up like it has, and regardless of the pull back in Twitch viewership, Apex did in 4 weeks what took Fortnite 16.

I think we'll see a rise in the coming weeks, especially if the software sector pops or gets any good news.\n* **52 Week High: $151.26 -** Seems this sector has lagged a bit on the recovery from December. I think that speaks to the room it has to run. Not really betting against it, more kids are born every day, and they floss their way around the house when I'm at family functions. Fuck, when I was a kid I just put olives on my fingers and ate them.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm going to start accumulating cheap lotto options in big lots, that are quite a ways out of the money.

I'm done playing this stock until it shows some balls and conviction.\n\n# Let's Talk Entries/Exits\n\nOkay boys and girls, I'm going to do some educating really quickly.\n\nIn your day to day trading if you act on emotion: Stop.\n\nIf you see a stock shoot up 5% after open and you FOMO it and it's been 10 minutes since the bell rang: Stop.\n\nIf you didn't play Disney: You should have.\n\nIf you decide to do some investigating and pick plays to make this week, don't feel obligated to open your positions Monday first thing. Likewise, you should never really open positions within the first 15-20 minutes of trading for a day. It's likely (like with SPY often) that the peak it achieves during open will be the biggest swing you will see for the day, and it's likely there's the least conviction behind it.\n\nWhen I pick an entry point, I look at the trend I'm following, I look at the stock, I decide where I think it can reach, what I'm willing to bet that it does, and what kind of swing I'm playing for.\n\nThis brings me to earnings season: Normally, I'm looking to get into positions at least a week before an earnings report because I'm taking on a vega advantageous position (the increase in it, specifically), but I had bad planning that week.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, none of that matters this week. **BECAUSE ITS EARNINGS SEASON LETS** ***GOOOOOOOOOOOO.***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 15th, 2019 [EARNINGS TIME]\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself. Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I'm considering entering. These notes are not to you personally.**\n\nThis week I'm changing up how I do this. I'm offering the info that I see pertinent to the play I plan on making and if somebody decides to do their own DD and makes a similar trade, I won't always get dicked on my entries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bank of America (BAC) - $30.17 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report on Tuesday before open.** At this point, for me to bet against the banks it'd take a lot of conviction that a certain bank has a certain problem they can't overcome. People are borrowing like crazy still, we saw how strong the entire sector was Friday, and although Bank of America's been on a tear as of late I still think it has potential to really break above a long time range it's been stuck in. They popped hard on the other financial reports, but I don't think that diminishes their possibility to go further. They may correct in the day before earnings, so I'm going to look hard for a good entry. Market \n\n* **Expected Move - $1.04** \\- I think this is low. I think we can see a $1.50 move on earnings day, and I think that as long as orange man doesn't say stupid shit, we can probably tack on another 1-2% the rest of the week.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ2 18 $28.55 -&gt; $29.78\n   * FQ4 18 $26.55 -&gt; $28.45 \n* **52 Week High: $31.91 -** This is important, because it's approaching a point where if it can get past this, we may see new money flood in and help push it higher. It all depends on volume and conviction though.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at FD's and longer dated calls on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Atlassian (TEAM) - $112.68 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report on Wednesday after close.** One of my businesses is a large scale development project, we have roughly 10 devs/designers/team members. We've been using Atlassian products for like 7 years. Every time something else pops out that integrates cleanly, we try it, often buy it. They've been getting subscriptions from me forever, and I'm grandfathered into a good plan on one of them. The fact is their culture/infrastructure/family of products pulls you in and doesn't let you go. Knowing a lot about the company personally, having a lot of experience with it and knowing how crucial it is to so many people, I assume their churn rate is pretty low historically/projected to stay low. This company is really on the come up. I'm bullish.\n\n* **Expected Move - $9.86** \\- They're a growing company and each time they prove it, they gain hand over fist. This might be exuberant -- but I really do think they have potential to become a $200 stock in the next 12 months.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ1 18 $40.25 -&gt; $50.17 (25% HELLOOOO)\n   * FQ4 18 $66.83 -&gt; $73.84\n   * FQ1 19 $81.89 -&gt; $70.18 (by 11/28, a month later, it was exploding back above this price and basically fucking ignored the December selloff)\n* **52 Week High: $116.70 -** It solidly retraced its December lows back upwards, and has hesitated barely, with the regular gain/consolidate pattern upwards. I don't think it's slowing down.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm looking at calls both FD's for the earnings move and Junes at a wide spread apart. I'm going to give the long dated ones room to play as a lotto ticket for as cheap as I can get them and assume the trend continues, and play the FD's for at least a 200% gain based on the move that is priced in being smaller than I think they'll gain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Netflix (NFLX) - $351.14** ***- BEARISH*** \\- **They report on Tuesday after close.** So, Netflix is a touchy subject for me. I've bet against them twice, and lost heavily on both plays. I bet for them, and lost both also. I basically was backwards both times. While I think they appropriately guided last time based on them saying most growth would be international for their last quarter, I think that Disney's meteoric rise on Friday followed by them losing 4.5% was an indication of the multiple this stock trades at -- and sentiment that people really think that Disney is a challenger. Once Apple actually announces their streaming specifics, I think they will be a contender also. That being said, I think a lot of people are of the belief that there is room for everyone, and while that's true, I see inevitable growth slowing with Netflix over the next two years because of the other companies entering the market. Not negative growth, but a curb of their exponential growth, and the need to spend more to acquire -- means lower EPS. I don't think the company will necessarily ever really fall to #2 in the department, but I think the stock is pretty overvalued right now unless they find a means to leverage their subscribers for more money. They can only raise prices so often though.\n\nThat all being said - once again, the entire economic situation seemed dire last quarter -- but I think of it this way: People knew that they weren't cancelling Netflix. You may buy less cars, you buy cheaper toilet paper, you don't cancel Netflix, because most people that come home from their shit job or tough day need it. They live for it. I don't think the economic situation really affects this company, and thus, they're at a PE of fucking 140. How far can this company really go? Can they get a billion subscribers? I just don't see that happening, I really don't.\n\nThey're also going to shell out $3 BILLION DOLLARS this year. That's almost double 2016, and a billion over 2017. That's a lot of dough man, and if their growth isn't still exponential, how do they plan to start increasing their free cash flow. It's on a downward spiral, so what's the deal? They just stop paying for content? Can't. Management says they will, but how the fuck will you keep the buzz going for the service with the introduction of two competitors? New people to streaming won't just automatically buy Netflix now, Disney or Apple may be the first stop. Stop advertising? Maybe, but that's probably a fraction of what they spend on infrastructure and content.\n\nLong story short, I'm betting against them in two ways.\n\n* **Expected Move - $25.30** \\- It could be way more, or way less than this. They may give away 10% and rally it back in two days. This stocks just so volatile around their earnings reports.\n* **Noteworthy Earnings Moves**\n   * FQ2 17 $161.70 -&gt; $183.60\n   * FQ4 17 $227.58 -&gt; $250.29\n   * FQ2 18 $400.48 -&gt; $379.48\n   * FQ4 18 $351.39 -&gt; $339.10\n* **52 Week High: $423.21 -** This stocks just really overvalued in my opinion. I understand their subs are worth something but I think before it gets back here, it's going to trace back below $300 at some point.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm playing one or two at the money contracts on this probably, and maybe a way OTM straddle in May, but I'm not sure. It takes serious balls to bet against this stock, and it takes serious balls to play it period because the options are definitely appropriately priced, if not over priced, and it's a way to just light a bunch of fucking money on fire. It's earnings season though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EA (EA) - $101.83** ***- BULLISH*** \\- **They report on 5/7/19 after close.** I'm looking to start setting up some multi-leg and long term plays here. The fact of the matter is, I play Apex occasionally. I hate battle royale games, but I fucking love that game. My friends and I get fucked up and play once a week or so after we all get done working/with meetings. There is almost no chance they thought this game would blow up like it has, and regardless of the pull back in Twitch viewership, Apex did in 4 weeks what took Fortnite 16. Obviously, they share player bases, but I don't think it matters. Games cycle through this industry, and it's gone from PUBG, to H1Z1, to Fortnite, and I think Apex will continue making the company more money in the first year than they forecasted.\n\n* **My Target For Lotto's - $130-$140 by September** \\- They could hit this mark in the weeks after earnings, even. I think we'll see a rise in the coming weeks, especially if the software sector pops or gets any good news.\n* **52 Week High: $151.26 -** Seems this sector has lagged a bit on the recovery from December. I think that speaks to the room it has to run. Not really betting against it, more kids are born every day, and they floss their way around the house when I'm at family functions. Fuck, when I was a kid I just put olives on my fingers and ate them.\n* **Plays I'm Looking At -** I'm going to start accumulating cheap lotto options in big lots, that are quite a ways out of the money. I plan to add to my position slowly, and then liquidate some near earnings if the move starts running my way. I'll probably buy some FD's for the earnings week expiration, the week before, and if all works out, roll it into shares or more calls and ride it as long as I can.\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe're approaching all time highs still and I'm pretty confident we'll be achieving them. Almost every company guided low for this quarter, and we're seeing slowly the economy wasn't nearly as bad as we thought. Evidence: Financial earnings on Friday. I think that we'll see a 3:1 or 4:1 beat/miss rate, and betting the upside during earnings this season is going to be pretty easy to profit. Doesn't mean I'm blindly yolo'ing the upside, but I'm definitely leaning that way if I'm ever on the fence. Unless it's Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. That company is shit.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it's more likely SPY gains that week since it's weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it's a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it's probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\nEdit: Not doing this \n\nIf you've got something you are eyeing, I'll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. I probably won't go over them all and likely already have my thoughts on many, but I'll try to reply with thoughts on many. The threads will get longer week by week, so try to understand if I don't get to all of them. Below is a list of stocks I won't cover, and it will grow week by week. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I'll simply ignore your comment. This warning is all over the post.\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don't mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there's a conversation going on about it already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Private Messages/Chat Requests:**  Hit me up if you have questions.

Totally revolutionized the industry with their G6 continuous glucose monitoring system. Their sensors are used with Tandems insulin pumps and they've partnered with Eli Lilly (\nhttps://provider.dexcom.com/industry-news/dexcom-announces-development-agreement-lilly-integrate-dexcom-cgm-connected-diabetes) and Novo nordisk as well recently. The next gen G7 sensor is in development with Alphabet a development partner. \n\nThe stock has recently taken a beating due to competition from Abbott's freestyle libre system which is similar to DexComs system. There are subtle differences. I believe DexCom makes the superior product by a thin margin. The next generation product, the G7 will likely be far superior to anything on the market.\n\nI think the diabetes market is large enough to support multiple large competitors anyways. \n\nEarnings are May 1st. I am bullish because I believe outlook on this company is great, Tandem did great with their last earnings and diabetes is rampant. Go long. \n\n\nNovartis: \nCan we talk about this company for a sec?\n\nJust take a second and look at that beast of a pipeline. \n\nTake a look at some of their assets. Some big names include Entresto and Gleevec. I'm super bullish because of their gad Dotatate product Lutathera, used for imaging AND treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. It's some real advanced shit and a real money maker for hospitals. \n\nRecent shift to focus on high margin products, including sell off of Alcon. Market perceived this as negative for some reason? I'm bullish.\n\nCheck the RSI on this company in the teens. \n\nWe're going into earnings soon. This may be the one for FDs, tbh. \n\n\nGME:\nCome on now. Do I even need to say anything here? This pos going to Earth's core. Their business model is fucked with streaming games coming. Disc-less Xbox to be announced in May, that will be a shot to the knees. The more we hear about Stadia (alphabet's streaming game service) and the likely soon to be announced competition from Amzn, this stock will continue to crater further and further. Moreover, they've guided eps of 0.00 for first quarter. So that nice dividend they've been paying out for so long? That won't be sustainable much longer when their cash flow is negative and the coffers are empty.\n\nShort this shit. Long dated puts as volume allows. \n\n\nMCD: \nI'm gonna be honest here.

It's some really innovative stuff. Big data works, just ask Daddy Trump. \n\nLong dated calls/spreads and shares is the play here. \n\nThey've got earnings coming up, I don't see any particular reason to partake in FD type gambling. Instead, the smart move would be to sell puts at peak IV, as the worst that can happen is you pick up some shares of a great company that's very likely to do well long term. Or buy LEAP calls and sell weekly, OTM calls against those if you're bullish short term....

The volume didn\'t break even the average, so I not very confident in it. It hasn\'t consolidated yet, so there is a potential for tomorrow to be a red day (not 100% on this). Since $SPY is riding the 6 and 12 day EMAs, it\'s pretty solid trend. The lack of consolidation and the fact that the RSI has crossed into overbought (keep in mind, stocks and ETFs are capable of continuing above 70% for a while- but we usually see a pullback. So its possible to expect that tomorrow. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5x2bp0iks4u21.png\n\nThis isn\'t any particular pattern as far as I am aware, but I\'ve definitely seen this happen a few times with stocks before and it acts as an ascending wedge. \\*It could fall back.\\*\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/sxvdnm0as4u21.png\n\n\\*\\*$AAPL- (Bullish)\\*\\*\n\nI called the bull run on Apple around March 20th and i still see it happening.\n\nApple has ER in about a week, and a shit ton of ground to cover. Many stocks have to recover back before the Q4 bear run. Including $AMZN and this boi. This stock definitely feels like it can potentially rise back to around $230, If the ER is solid it\'ll probably be the catalyst that we need push up past the $210 resistance. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/suesyhqjv4u21.png\n\nThe cross on the RSI, isn\'t necessarily the cause for concern, but we should anticipate that we\'ll lose some momentum which is why you don\'t \\*BUY FDs ON SWINGS.\\* \n\n I swung this for a few days and made a decent percentage with minimal downside. It works (mostly). I\'ll probably get in and out through the rest of the week. \n\n\\*UNH- Bullish\\* \n\nThis stock is a paint point for me because I was in a Puts play in it when it was about $1.50. I pussied out and watched this bastard climb it\'s way to $11.00. But its a good play. It\'s recovering from a major market over reaction to the ER and the Bernie Sanders Medicare-for-all. \n\nI really like the options on this stock and they are powerful on solid moves. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zhplvkalx4u21.png\n\n\n\n The DMI+ is pushing upward while the - is downward with a stronger ADX. With the MACD is also recovering. And the Weekly bottom candle is (kind of) a Doji. With this week being a confirmation- thus far. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tz5gsf1205u21.png\n\nI\'d wait for it to break 232. It may try to fill a gap up to 234, which isnt that big, but gives it an official bull trend which is a good thing for calls as it\'ll break the 12 day EMA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Amazon (AMZN)- Bullish \\*\\* \n\nI definitely think I could confidently $LONG this stock up to 2000. It\'s just how $AMZN moves sometimes. May see some resistance around 1967. And probably 1950 since that\'s just how it does things. \n\nNot going to bother with a chart here. \n\nI am concerned though, because I\'ve been seeing a bearish divergence so It may reverese sometime soon, pretty strongly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Boeing (BA) -sidways until it crosses 384\\*\\* \n\nTheir ER is tomorrow morning. So basically I anticipate that they won\'t be down on revenue because the MAX 8 weren\'t discontinued till the end of the quarter. HOWEVER, we will definitely see them lowering their guidance for obvious reasons.\n\nSo the open gap from a bit ago has some room to fill. We have a support level at $363. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/v5ayc3y125u21.png\n\nIf the ER has a bullish sentiment behind it- then you can anticipate a large move. Probably to 378 or 380, depending on the open.  \n\nVolume Drop-off is because of ER so expect some interesting volatility tomorrow. (I can\'t really speak to how much, yet) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\##I\'m tired as fuck and have other shit to do now, so I\'ll just post the rest of my notes and update this later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*ROKU\\*\\* \n\n on the weekly is a double top, reaching its bottom, as well as on the daily a major break through a major support . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*JNJ\\*\\*\n\nGood guidance in ER but a strong 140 resistance.

It works (mostly). I\'ll probably get in and out through the rest of the week. \n\n\\*UNH- Bullish\\* \n\nThis stock is a paint point for me because I was in a Puts play in it when it was about $1.50. I pussied out and watched this bastard climb it\'s way to $11.00. But its a good play. It\'s recovering from a major market over reaction to the ER and the Bernie Sanders Medicare-for-all. \n\nI really like the options on this stock and they are powerful on solid moves. \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zhplvkalx4u21.png\n\n\n\n The DMI+ is pushing upward while the - is downward with a stronger ADX. With the MACD is also recovering. And the Weekly bottom candle is (kind of) a Doji. With this week being a confirmation- thus far. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/tz5gsf1205u21.png\n\nI\'d wait for it to break 232. It may try to fill a gap up to 234, which isnt that big, but gives it an official bull trend which is a good thing for calls as it\'ll break the 12 day EMA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Amazon (AMZN)- Bullish \\*\\* \n\nI definitely think I could confidently $LONG this stock up to 2000. It\'s just how $AMZN moves sometimes. May see some resistance around 1967. And probably 1950 since that\'s just how it does things. \n\nNot going to bother with a chart here. \n\nI am concerned though, because I\'ve been seeing a bearish divergence so It may reverese sometime soon, pretty strongly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Boeing (BA) -sidways until it crosses 384\\*\\* \n\nTheir ER is tomorrow morning. So basically I anticipate that they won\'t be down on revenue because the MAX 8 weren\'t discontinued till the end of the quarter. HOWEVER, we will definitely see them lowering their guidance for obvious reasons.\n\nSo the open gap from a bit ago has some room to fill. We have a support level at $363. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/v5ayc3y125u21.png\n\nIf the ER has a bullish sentiment behind it- then you can anticipate a large move. Probably to 378 or 380, depending on the open.  \n\nVolume Drop-off is because of ER so expect some interesting volatility tomorrow. (I can\'t really speak to how much, yet) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\##I\'m tired as fuck and have other shit to do now, so I\'ll just post the rest of my notes and update this later. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*ROKU\\*\\* \n\n on the weekly is a double top, reaching its bottom, as well as on the daily a major break through a major support . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*JNJ\\*\\*\n\nGood guidance in ER but a strong 140 resistance. (this note is from quite a bit ago.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*QCOM\\*\\*\n\n (also from about a week ago after the lawsuit ended) \n\nInsane Move, Outlook on this should be put side\n\n(STRONG) 76.5 Level, Most recent Highest High, High Vol Break Down for Trade\n\n(IDK) 81.23 Level, Got it in the last 5 Years, Was previous High at that Time, Pre-market seems to hit that Level\n\n(IDK) 78.38 Level, Bottom of that range from this level to 81.23, could act as "support"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\##Final Notes: \n\nI did notice that most if not all of my plays are $LONG. This is either because I\'m wrong, or the market it bullish, idiot. But seriously, some of these have intraday shorts that you\'ll want be on the look out for if you scalp at all. Otherwise, wait for confirmation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of these plays can be weighted by the whole market or sector depending on how everything goes. If you see $SPY jump up $10 or some bullshit like that, expect the same for most of the tech stocks. We\'re at a very interesting point in the market in my opinion and at this point it\'s anyone\'s game. We could continue to rally or all of the newbies entering the market will get mega-fucked and time will tell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven\'t entirely determined how I\'ll format these, but i will probably try to keep it up because if I don\'t I\'ll have an autistic fit and just buy a bunch of Macy\'s calls.'), ('Elon said short $TSLA', 'Elon said short $TSLA')], '2019-04-25': [('Me a year after selling my MSFT to double down on MU', 'Me a year after selling my MSFT to double down on MU'), ('My Autism - A Personal Story', 'My Autism - A Personal Story&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - I took out a personal loan for 12k. Lost it all. I took out a second personal loan for 20k. Lost it all. I took out a 3rd personal loan for 35k and managed to make back all my money.  Moral of the story, keep borrowing until you get it right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood afternoon my fellow Autists,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to make a post about the perils of options and stocks. I started options trading last summer while watching MU gains and MU profit porn. I jumped in with about 2.5k (which came from a reimbursement check from work). So rather than pay off my credit cards with it, I\'m like, "Let\'s see if I can turn this into some big gains!" Well, I turned it into 5k and was super excited. Queue "Stormy Weather" and a substantial loss. Well shit. Here comes another reimbursement check, let\'s see if I can double down. Queue a shitty earnings report. So I took my losses, transferred what I was supposed to pay my reimbursement checks towards to a 0% interest credit card for 18 months and am currently paying that shit down. I took a break from stocks in general for awhile, until the imfamous December 24th period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad had just given me 300$ for Christmas, and I transferred that and 100$ into my Robinhood account. Decided to buy calls on SPY on the 26th and instantly got 400% gains and was realized it was super easy. I thought to myself, "Only if I had more money, this could have been substantial!" So, I was in calls for a bit, riding the trend upward, but was drinking the bear kool-aid, and kept losing money here and there on puts. And finally, I log into my American Express account and see I pre-qualify for a personal loan of up to 15k. Now, at first I\'m like, "That\'s a stupid idea." I\'ve read your warnings, I\'ve seen the loss porn, and all that jazz and thought, "Nah." Well, it pops up a few times, and at this point, I\'m making some good moves, but my account is still less than $5,000. I\'ve been playing AMZN when it was swinging between 1600 and 1700, making a double amount here and there, but I wanted more. So finally, I dip my toes into it and sign up for 12k personal loan from AMEX. My goal here was to buy AMZN calls when it was around $1600. I did - and made a few thousand, but my total losses from all time was around 23k. I ended up losing the majority of that personal loan trying to time the top. So I did what any autist does, and kept doubling down on some stuff. I took out another personal loan through Lendingclub for about 20k+1600$ origination fee. After that, I did my riskiest play to date (other than gambling) was buying 25k worth of weekly NFLX 370$ calls and selling them for 31K. That was awesome. But that got me banned from Robinhood due to day trading and not finishing above 25k. (Just prior to this, I had 20k with of IWM puts when it was 158, expiring 2 weeks out. If would have held, they would have been worth 90k+ when it dropped to 151 the following week.) So I was mad at myself for that and wanted to make another big play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI transfer my money into my etrade account, and while I wait for funds to settle, I\'m watching AMZN rise from low 1600s. If I could trade in Robinhood or had my money been settled there, I would have all in\'d some weekly AMZN calls. I had to watch it rise to the 1700s and miss out. I wanted revenge. Queue that Monday when SPY rose from 271 to 278 in a single day. I did the autismo thing and bought weekly puts near open when it was 274 and watched 20k turn into 10k in a single day. I wasn\'t worried - it has to go down eventually right? Nope. So, I sold my puts and my account value turned into about 2k. I now worked on a strategy to earn back my money. After calculating how much I could afford in monthly payments, bills, and what not, I calculated I could take on one more personal loan payment. I wouldn\'t be as retarded this time, though. I got rejected from a couple of places, but SoFi - bless their retarded souls, decided they would give me a 35k personal loan. Had I not been approved of this personal loan, I would have cut my losses and just accepted my fate of 3 years worth of personal loan payments. A few days later, 35k landed in my account. I paid off some of my other personal loans, through some money into savings, and transferred about 30k in Etrade. I swore off weeklies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI purchased about 30k worth of $BB stock and JAN 2020 calls prior to their earnings and made about 20k. I sold some for profit on that day, and lost about 10k the next day when it decided to drop. I pulled out about 5k, made some payments, and then tried to play AMZN and NFLX again, and lost about 5k there, but I didn\'t gamble the whole farm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree weeks ago, I stumbled on "I pick stocks and options so you don\'t have to", and read through it. I decided to follow u/SoRefreshing on his TWTR play and bought some $36 strike and $41 strike calls for June 21st for a total of 27k. The day before earnings, Monday of this week, my account value sat at 19k and I was down 8k from that play. Earnings came out and I hit a high that day of 52k that day, and ended up around 48k. I sold some for profit, withdrew some money, and let it sit a day. Next day rolled around, I said fuck it, sold  75% of the rest, rolled others out to September, and bought some $FB stock and 5k worth of calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, around 2 PM, I decided one more yolo, and through everything (except 15k worth of TWTR Sep calls) into $FB calls. Today, I consider myself lucky. Hope you enjoyed my retardation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning, I withdrew about 10k from my account, sold some stuff off, repositioned some things, and now I\'m sitting at around 73k in my etrade account. \n\nHere is proof. \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/3qPCIfC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3qPCIfC.jpg)'), ('$AMZN Amazon Earnings thread; Keep all discussion here', '$AMZN Amazon Earnings thread; Keep all discussion hereEPS est: $4.667\n\nEPS actual:\n\nRevenue est: $59.683B\n\nRevenue actual:\n\nBeat on EPS 6/8\n\nBeat on revenue 6/8\n\n48 buy ratings, 1 hold, 1 sell\n\n$2,133.29 price target'), ('Short TSLA', 'Short TSLA'), ('Long $AMZN: Amazon computer system automatically fires lazy employees', 'Long $AMZN: Amazon computer system automatically fires lazy employees'), ('$TSLA naked options are free money.

Lost it all. I took out a second personal loan for 20k. Lost it all. I took out a 3rd personal loan for 35k and managed to make back all my money.  Moral of the story, keep borrowing until you get it right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood afternoon my fellow Autists,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to make a post about the perils of options and stocks. I started options trading last summer while watching MU gains and MU profit porn. I jumped in with about 2.5k (which came from a reimbursement check from work). So rather than pay off my credit cards with it, I\'m like, "Let\'s see if I can turn this into some big gains!" Well, I turned it into 5k and was super excited. Queue "Stormy Weather" and a substantial loss. Well shit. Here comes another reimbursement check, let\'s see if I can double down. Queue a shitty earnings report. So I took my losses, transferred what I was supposed to pay my reimbursement checks towards to a 0% interest credit card for 18 months and am currently paying that shit down. I took a break from stocks in general for awhile, until the imfamous December 24th period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad had just given me 300$ for Christmas, and I transferred that and 100$ into my Robinhood account. Decided to buy calls on SPY on the 26th and instantly got 400% gains and was realized it was super easy. I thought to myself, "Only if I had more money, this could have been substantial!" So, I was in calls for a bit, riding the trend upward, but was drinking the bear kool-aid, and kept losing money here and there on puts. And finally, I log into my American Express account and see I pre-qualify for a personal loan of up to 15k. Now, at first I\'m like, "That\'s a stupid idea." I\'ve read your warnings, I\'ve seen the loss porn, and all that jazz and thought, "Nah." Well, it pops up a few times, and at this point, I\'m making some good moves, but my account is still less than $5,000. I\'ve been playing AMZN when it was swinging between 1600 and 1700, making a double amount here and there, but I wanted more. So finally, I dip my toes into it and sign up for 12k personal loan from AMEX. My goal here was to buy AMZN calls when it was around $1600. I did - and made a few thousand, but my total losses from all time was around 23k. I ended up losing the majority of that personal loan trying to time the top. So I did what any autist does, and kept doubling down on some stuff. I took out another personal loan through Lendingclub for about 20k+1600$ origination fee. After that, I did my riskiest play to date (other than gambling) was buying 25k worth of weekly NFLX 370$ calls and selling them for 31K. That was awesome. But that got me banned from Robinhood due to day trading and not finishing above 25k. (Just prior to this, I had 20k with of IWM puts when it was 158, expiring 2 weeks out. If would have held, they would have been worth 90k+ when it dropped to 151 the following week.) So I was mad at myself for that and wanted to make another big play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI transfer my money into my etrade account, and while I wait for funds to settle, I\'m watching AMZN rise from low 1600s. If I could trade in Robinhood or had my money been settled there, I would have all in\'d some weekly AMZN calls. I had to watch it rise to the 1700s and miss out. I wanted revenge. Queue that Monday when SPY rose from 271 to 278 in a single day. I did the autismo thing and bought weekly puts near open when it was 274 and watched 20k turn into 10k in a single day. I wasn\'t worried - it has to go down eventually right? Nope. So, I sold my puts and my account value turned into about 2k. I now worked on a strategy to earn back my money. After calculating how much I could afford in monthly payments, bills, and what not, I calculated I could take on one more personal loan payment. I wouldn\'t be as retarded this time, though. I got rejected from a couple of places, but SoFi - bless their retarded souls, decided they would give me a 35k personal loan. Had I not been approved of this personal loan, I would have cut my losses and just accepted my fate of 3 years worth of personal loan payments. A few days later, 35k landed in my account. I paid off some of my other personal loans, through some money into savings, and transferred about 30k in Etrade. I swore off weeklies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI purchased about 30k worth of $BB stock and JAN 2020 calls prior to their earnings and made about 20k. I sold some for profit on that day, and lost about 10k the next day when it decided to drop. I pulled out about 5k, made some payments, and then tried to play AMZN and NFLX again, and lost about 5k there, but I didn\'t gamble the whole farm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree weeks ago, I stumbled on "I pick stocks and options so you don\'t have to", and read through it. I decided to follow u/SoRefreshing on his TWTR play and bought some $36 strike and $41 strike calls for June 21st for a total of 27k. The day before earnings, Monday of this week, my account value sat at 19k and I was down 8k from that play. Earnings came out and I hit a high that day of 52k that day, and ended up around 48k. I sold some for profit, withdrew some money, and let it sit a day. Next day rolled around, I said fuck it, sold  75% of the rest, rolled others out to September, and bought some $FB stock and 5k worth of calls. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, around 2 PM, I decided one more yolo, and through everything (except 15k worth of TWTR Sep calls) into $FB calls. Today, I consider myself lucky. Hope you enjoyed my retardation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis morning, I withdrew about 10k from my account, sold some stuff off, repositioned some things, and now I\'m sitting at around 73k in my etrade account. \n\nHere is proof. \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/3qPCIfC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/3qPCIfC.jpg)'), ('$AMZN Amazon Earnings thread; Keep all discussion here', '$AMZN Amazon Earnings thread; Keep all discussion hereEPS est: $4.667\n\nEPS actual:\n\nRevenue est: $59.683B\n\nRevenue actual:\n\nBeat on EPS 6/8\n\nBeat on revenue 6/8\n\n48 buy ratings, 1 hold, 1 sell\n\n$2,133.29 price target'), ('Short TSLA', 'Short TSLA'), ('$TSLA naked options are free money.

FB has a habit of fading the day after ER beat (it's beat the past three ER's counting this recent one) and the following day. **The play: 5/10 197.50c; or (courtesy of** u/IrregardlessOfFeels**): June 21st 220c for 0.44ish. This latter play is much safer: sell when FB gets to 198 or 200.** \n2. XLNX: ER showed that revenue was great. Dropped to 111 on Friday, only to bounce hard to 118. If you would have bought FD 120calls on Friday morning, when it was at 111, they cost 0.30 and ended up being 1.88 eod. That's $150 profit per contract (This is the kind of play I dream of: you buy 100x and end up making 15k in a day.) Anyways, the point is that investors are still buying XNLX as their 5g investment/bet. \\***The play: WAIT for the dip on Monday morning. See if it dips to 116ish and then jump in on 5/10 125c for hopefully under $1.0/contract.** For those who like TA, the daily and 4hr show a sexy *shooting star* candle! :) [https://www.tradingview.com/x/QFP7RyV8/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/QFP7RyV8/)\n3. IWM: So IWM has battled with the 158 MEGA IRON resistance so many times it's funny. It tried and failed back in Jan and March 2018. When it finally won on May 11 2018 (the only time it has won), it FLEW!! Now it tried in Feb and got rejected hard. So far IWM has tried to breatk 158 ***ELEVEN times in April,*** including Friday. It will certainly try to continue its attempt on Friday on Monday. If it breaks, it will fly to 160 easily; then consolidate at 160 for a day or two, and then fly again to 164. **The play: 5/10 162calls for 0.39 ish.** If IWM breaks 158 this week like I think, then this will give you an excellent return. (I plan on buying 100 of these on Monday on the dip to 157, if it does in fact dip). If you have a larger account, then **5/10 160calls for 0.95ish**, which will be *very* profitable if IWM hits 160 this week. Market seems SUPER euphorically hot right now. ER's are going well. GDP was amazing. SPY looks like it will most certainly make a new ATH this week. If SPY does make a new ATH on monday, then IWM should be able to break through 158 and it will FLY.

Remember: Fed Rate cuts are a tremendous blessing to small cap businesses who want cheap debt to grow their businesses. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLottery play: NVDA. Because of the INTC miss, NVDA has already had it's pre-ER cool off and reset. If AMD and AAPL beat, I think NVDA will gain momentum. ER is on 5/16. It held its 175 support on Friday, and 175 is strong support. So if it holds, it will only consolidate or go up. So the play is a ER run up play, which will be stimulated by tech beats this week (esp AMD). **The play: PRE-ER run up 5/10 190c, since 191 has been a magnet, for 1.37ish. Or 192.50c for $0.97ish. OR for ER IV play: 5/17 200c for $1.70ish.** This last play is pretty damn exciting. NVDA's ER IV boost has not yet been priced in. The premium is currently pricing in 49% IV, but during the day before ER the IV should shoot up between 150% to 200%. So if NVDA makes it to, say, 191 ish again the week of ER, those 200c's should be much more than 1.70ish. Plus, if NVDA continues to go up, you don't have to wait till week of ER to sell either if you're happy with profits."), ('Elon Musk must want to drive down $TSLA so SpaceX can buy it like $TSLA bought Solar City', 'Elon Musk must want to drive down $TSLA so SpaceX can buy it like $TSLA bought Solar CityThat was his plan to take it private all along.'), ('0 DTE options', '0 DTE optionsHello everyone I currently trade the SP500 and Nasdaq futures but want to dabble into  the ETF options such as SPY and QQQ.

Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won\'t divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it\'s high and buy IV when it\'s low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don\'t want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low\'s and high\'s, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nA lot of you ask me if I have anywhere outside of here you can follow me on, etc. Follow me on my reddit profile, first of all, that\'s where you\'ll get anything in the future. Yeah I\'m working on a blog and stuff but I\'m a busy dude in real life and it\'s taken a back seat to my real clients and obligations. I\'m still working on it. No, I won\'t share it here - mods have explicitly said no, so leave it there and **don\'t bother them about it.** That being said, I plan on making somewhere to share thoughts outside of this post, yes, it\'s coming, yes, but I\'m busy as fuck with my business(es) and clients, meetings, etc.\n\n# Some Thoughts About Last Week \n\n**What a week it was.** Mostly all the picks last week worked out in real time, same week which isn\'t always the case. Those of you that bought Twitter from a few weeks back on the longer dated option (which I always recommend) probably did pretttttty good with it. These picks don\'t necessarily always start this week, or end this week. These are the ideas that have crafted new trade theories based on what I believe to be true. Entering at the right time is an art, and I\'ve spoken about this so many times but:\n\nI cannot teach you how to trade. Only how to pick things to trade. The trading is the hard part - we\'re not investing -- we\'re trading. Essentially it\'s high level gambling: Knowing when to hold \'em and knowing when to fold \'em is what this game is about.\n\n**Just because a stock is listed here doesn\'t mean you blindly just enter a fucking trade on it.** Look for the entry, look for the catalysts, take advantage of sector moves or other binary events, take advantage of pullbacks or consolidation to look for a price. Set stop limits and don\'t blow your load on weeklies because there\'s very few cases where they work well (Disney anybody).\n\n**The trend is your friend.**\n\n# About Playing Earnings Events\n\nPeople ask how I normally trade earnings, are you selling? are you holding? what are you doing? etc. Here\'s my formula, it may or may not work for you but this is traditionally what I do.\n\nAny earnings events I play, I\'m normally in on the first sign of an uptrend/downtrend in the 2 week window prior to earnings OR I\'m playing by letting earnings dictate the trend, and buying after the IV crush happens.\n\n**THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND.**\n\nRemember: The **ENTIRE** predicating factor in my plays is normally to catch higher periods of volatility at the right time, to profit not only on a move, but on the increase in Vega value of the option. Buying FD\'s the day before an earnings report is the opposite of this and while it SEEMS like it\'s your only way to make a 10-bagger happen, it couldn\'t be further from the truth.\n\nBeing in BEFORE the volatility allows me to simply liquidate a portion of the contracts for a profit, sometimes regardless of it even going slightly against the current price (average doooooown).\n\n**I recommend finding a strategy that works for you and executing it.** If you buy 0-day or front month/front week FD\'s on earnings and lose, you should NOT be surprised. I\'d say you likely are going to lose on 75%+ of those trades, moderately profit on about 90% of the remaining, and pop off on 10% of the remaining 25% (2.5% of the time). Unless you have killer DD or a reason to think the market is pricing in too low of a move, you **CANNOT BEAT THE PRICING MODEL.** For you to win, something has to be wrong, skewed, mis-priced, you must know something about the company that you think analysts/market makers are wrong on, or you have to be advantageously positioned greek wise so that regardless what happens, you win.\n\nResearch **price neutral strategies** (butterflies and calendar spreads, specifically, I hate condors but you can look those up too) if you want a way to be **SHORT VEGA** without investing as much capital. I could write fucking pages on strategies, but I won\'t, and you should learn some about them on your own and fuck them up a few times before you figure out the right places to play them.\n\n**I bolded the words you need to research.** I\'m not commenting anymore on strategy stuff here. Most people still won\'t listen to this anyway, but...\n\n**A specific example:** I bought June MSFT $145 calls at $0.04 a piece, 40 of them, and then a chunk of $135\'s throughout the last couple days of the week before earnings. My scans showed that they were mis-priced and skewed, you couldn\'t have known this, but you can easily just by using intuition find these kinds of deals. They exist, trust me. Those $145 calls are now like $0.15 I think? But they were also $0.12 right before earnings, both because of the move up, but secondarily because of the Vega pump on the options. They barely moved in value after earnings, as the crush offset a lot of the price movement. I sold half (20) the day before earnings for 200%, and basically freerolled the rest. I sold a chunk between $0.14 and $0.16 after earnings, and still have 10 of them that I will iron fist until they go to 0 or make a grand or so. The trade is already profitable, I\'ve locked that in, and I get to ride the lotto ticket on the house. I have two months to watch and decide if I really want to let them wipe themselves out or just take some more cash and move on.\n\n**Buying price directional and holding, mathematically modeled, is a losing strategy when used by itself with no other factors taken into effect.** The smart traders will see this statement for what it means, others will see it to mean that you can\'t buy directional plays.

We know all about the good news and movement, I think it still has room to go but it\'s definitely going to find consolidation near 130 and chill for even another day or two longer than it has before it continues up. Pullback to 128-127 doesn\'t concern me and I\'ll just hold all my calls regardless. Looking at the movement of it, it\'s not completely out of the question to see one after earnings. I\'d feel comfortable just bag holding my June calls until probably the middle of May, if it\'s still flat then, I feel like the cushion I\'ve built is worth the risk for more upside here. I don\'t imagine it crashing down to 115 or anything, unless the entire market comes down with it.\n\n**Verizon (VZ) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $58.14, Closed: $56.58, H: $58.49 (pointless, as it was pre-market)\n\n* Yeah so they beat or whatever but it\'s a telecom company and their guidance was meh and the results were meh. I lost 60% on this trade, and just decided I\'d rather not watch for it or navigate it anymore. Can\'t win them all.\n\n**UnitedHealth (UNH) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $224.00, Closed: $237, H: $237.11\n\n* ***I got really lucky here.*** The timing was just pure luck that it occurred the week I listed it but it popped off and rose pretty much all week. I think that it\'s probably going to continue the trend as long as there\'s volume behind it because of the reasons listed last week: The assets and forward looking potential revenue are not reflected in the stock\'s price. \n\n**Tesla (TSLA) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $269.00, Closed: $235.14, L: $231.13\n\n* **This one made me feel like a prophet.** Let\'s quote myself: "It\'s always just a matter of time before they go back to $230 because of a car blowing up or somebody saying something stupid." $230ish? Check. Tesla exploded? Check. Tesla said stupid things about leaf blowers? Check. Print print print.\n\n**Facebook (FB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $178.25, Closed: $191.49, H: $198.48\n\n* Facebook had really stellar numbers in my opinion. Eventually, growth in USA has to stall and it did. The international numbers were fine, and the fact they\'re taking the front looking "Let\'s fight the privacy battle together" stance is great for sentiment and allows fund managers to freely continue piling into shares if they want to without their clients going SJW on them. I think the pullback is, well, whatever. People taking profit as they climb back near where they were last year, so wait for some high volume trading and an increase in price and this one still has room to make money. Sold half my calls for like 100%+ and the other half for a -2% loss because I held through the fall from grace for a day or two.\n\n**Intel (INTC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $58.15, Closed: $52.43, H: $59.29\n\n* Buy the dip in my opinion. Not gonna say much else here but the semis are under pressure -- but I think Intel is more isolated from the general semi companies solely because they\'ll always sell chips. Some of the old 1080ti cards that Nvidia sold are still running perfect and strong and the new gen offers an increase but not as incremental as people wanted. That being said, I think Nvidia is fine but they\'re a lot more prone to slowdowns than a company like Intel. I don\'t know when they\'ll stabilize, could be days or weeks, but when they do I\'d look to profit on the move back up. China trade deal could be a big catalyst proxy play here.\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 29th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself.** Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I\'m considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.  I may or may not enter trades on these or may already be in them. The bottom of the post has the options I\'m long on, as a secondary holding disclaimer.\n\nThere was a witch hunt in the Daily Discussion thread claiming I retroactively edit my posts HAHA like I give a fuck or something... I called Twitter, I don\'t really care what anybody says. Feels good from my side, BRAH. I don\'t list every play I make, just the ones I feel like the community would be most interested in playing. I don\'t mention the premium I may be selling (but will list it if it\'s on any of the options listed) and I don\'t mention any other neutral strategies I\'m holding if they\'re not in these stocks.\n\nI typed less commentary about each stock because there\'s so many this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) - $129.89 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Trend is your friend (anybody see a theme here?). Consolidation commencing, I plan on just holding my calls. Ride the wave. Numbers are good, Azure is growing, and if somehow before June that JEDI contract gets handed out and they get it, it goes up, hard and fast just the way I like it.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Holding my calls. Maybe adding more that are 10% or so OTM but knowing full well I may lose on them because it has to move, but if it does the payoff seems pretty immense and Mickey like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oracle (ORCL) - $55.41 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* For me, Oracle is kind of a proxy play and a momentum play. \n\nThere has been a pretty nice sized volume move on Oracle as of late and some of the bigger funds are adding to their holdings. The fact that Oracle is pretty cloud-driven, besides their enterprise on-site data storage (which is very much likely moving towards cloud based offerings) and that the data sector and cloud industry is booming ($TEAM anybody? Looks like it\'s climbing right back where it was after the ridiculous earnings selloff) I think it means they have a chance to start increasing market share. As a result, as more and more people buy into this theory, the price will rise as a forward looking idea and price it in. For me, the price is $56, if it can get over that and close there, the swing play is in full effect for me. It\'s right at new 52W highs and to me (trend, friend) and with any luck, the volume will hold up and we\'ll see it plow upwards further.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Specifically, some May monthly contracts at various strikes. Pick your poison, ROI comes with more risk, so the further out, the more risk. I\'m pretty likely to just buy right ATM, and double down on some out of the money ones if it starts going for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $178.09 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* BUYYYY THEEEE DIPPPPP. \n\nI am completely ignoring any \'market sector weakness\' people are talking about in semis. It\'s cyclical, yes, and that\'s something to be cognizant of. I\'m going to wait for the price to stabilize Monday and wait and see if any binary news pops its head out, orange man says something about China, etc. and make a decision if I want to enter or keep waiting. Ideally, it will go down even more, because Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. are going to be hugeeeeee benefactors to the trade deal news. **They report 5/16 and the fact the stock really hasn\'t moved much on a 2 month rolling basis, there seems to be upside on the idea of China, in and of itself.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Calls, various strikes, might even consider weeklies here because I\'m playing it as a swing. I don\'t want to personally throw a few thousand at like 2020 calls and have to let them sit there to profit 100%. I\'d rather just take a few shots at weeklies, or front month stuff, and see if I can catch a swing and just be appropriate each day or two and close out positions that are moving towards 20-50% losses, and take a few shots at it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disney (DIS) - $139.92 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* It\'s Mickey, mother fuckers. \n\nSaw Endgame, movie was pretty badass. They\'re going to enter a string of great movies, with Lion King also coming this year. Could they sell the news Monday? Sure, but idgaf. Mickey\'s my bro and I ride or die with him. If you don\'t know the updates here with Disney+ and what not, you\'re out of the loop and you should stop trading options. Nuff said imo. **They report next week, so it\'s important to pay attention to the fact that earnings and guidance COULD disappoint versus the share price at the time, and trigger a fat pullback. It\'s all risk/reward.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Throw a dart at a list of price strikes and buy them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Electronic Arts (EA) - $94.47 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- We talked about this one a week ago? I think. Or two weeks. \n\nEither way, it started to find that bottom entry point. People keep asking if I\'m concerned about Anthem. Those that are asking that I assume are gaming enthusiasts that watch a lot of clickbait YouTube videos and pay too much attention to what some random neckbeard think about the games that come out. The company made a killing on Apex (BUT THE BATTLE PASS!!!!! OMG, same shit, just shut up because people still bought it) and the number of people that I saw buying in game currency BEFORE the battle pass is immense. \n\nThey could not have imagined that they got to the player base they did so fast and more importantly the stock did not drop because of ANY of these reasons. It dropped because of the Origin security flaw. Flaw\'s fixed. Price hasn\'t gone back up. Not priced in. **They report NEXT WEEK so if I\'m going to up my position it will be this week, not next.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** June or even later calls. I\'m spread from strikes currently 115-125. I might even go deeper in the chain and bet on insane action in the next month. Depends how spicy I feel and whether Taco Tuesday is any good this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ) - $71.55 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report Wednesday after market.** A lot of people have heard me talk about this company. I **LOVE** Square. They have good tech and a good platform. I know that they\'re expanding their service offerings and improving on the software they acquired from Freshbooks. \n\nTheir appointments app is their bread and butter besides the payments fees, and the hardware sales help to push profits higher also. They just got me for like $600? I think or more even for a new iPad/stand setup. It just works well. This segways me to mention that if and when Stripe comes into the market as far as IPOs, be careful about being in Square or PayPal. Stripe is going to fucking crush it, they are the holy grail fintech company in my opinion.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Kind of sketch to get in now if you aren\'t, so I may just sell premium on these and then buy upside calls with the profits after earnings, but I\'m not 100% yet. I\'ll probably YOLO in on weeklies or something just because I can\'t help myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alaska Air (ALK) - $60.62 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* They just ate some price target cuts after earnings but I feel like analysts are pricing in the idea of a wide market pullback and the impacts of Boeing on the company. That being said I really like Alaska as a company and when I do fly, it\'s normally Alaska anywhere I go. Their price target cuts are still 15% or so above where the stock sits, and if the entire sector gets any type of positive news, they\'ll pop up along with Delta ($DAL) and Southwest ($LUV).\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** June or July\'s, trying to pick the strike that I feel they can reach, not surpass, and then selling a large portion of my position if they approach the price closely. In my opinion and modeling, $70.52 is the price my algorithm spit out at me. I won\'t say what goes into it, and I won\'t say what variables I set as the projection so don\'t ask, **and it means ABSOLUTELY nothing** but I just hate going against my computer because it turns into a snarky bitch when it\'s right and I\'m wrong. Either way, seems like the options aren\'t that pricy, although the spreads are kind of fucked on these. If you don\'t get a good fill on a dip at open when the bid spread crashes and rips the ask price down with it, then you probably won\'t find an advantageous position here. It\'s more lotto ticket than buying FD\'s on Square, honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Exxon Mobil (XOM) - $80.49 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* While the rest of the oil sector is buying itself up and combining companies into conglomerates even further, Exxon has shown some decided weakness and off their last earnings report, I\'d be willing to say we see a dip here that I\'m willing to jump on the train for. \n\nIt all depends on risk tolerance though because I\'m kind of betting against a hot market with where oil prices are at and it\'s completely possible the market 100% ignores everything that is out there on the company and is completely irrational and the price just goes up. Sure, crude pulled back but it\'s still way above where it was in recent months, so to me, that would signal that guidance for these companies could be getting sandbagged for the next round of earnings, so keep this in mind because they probably aren\'t re-working guidance based on oil pricing fluctuations but rather a range and probability model of the prices in certain economic conditions in similar years.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Another spot where I\'m willing to sling a bit at a 3-5% move on weeklies for puts because they\'re really not that expensive and people/algos will freak out over the Trump ceiling on the oil market. I\'m personally considering following up the weeklies with some that are longer expiration, at a deeper strike, and rolling my weeklies along the way until I decide I\'ve lost/made enough on the trade. Oil markets kind of a bitch sometimes and I have a slight vendetta against it for life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Occidental (OXY) - $61.31 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* I\'m going against the grain with this company because they continually are in the news and have allowed themselves to enter a bidding war with Chevron now over Anadarko. \n\nChevron will likely win this battle for the reason that I have a inkling that there\'s some options written into the deal for executives which would explain why they may take a lower priced offer for the company. If this happens, it will make Occidental appear snubbed and like a bitch, and thus, the price will go down because shareholders will lose faith in the ability of the board to get a deal done. Moreover, they\'ve raised their bid and showed they\'re willing to pay more, so Chevron could bid this way the fuck up and if the bidding war doesn\'t stop -- shareholders traditionally don\'t like a company paying way more for something just because someone bullied them into it.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** This is another play I like shorter term holdings on. I\'ll probably buy puts and hold for a day or two, and roll some profits if they win or pick a different entry. I\'d like to see lower volume on the day or timeframe I decide to enter, it would show me people aren\'t really trading it and stockholders or algo\'s could sell it off in anticipation of the entire situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify (SPOT) - $138.25 -** ***BEARISH*** \\- **They report tomorrow before market.** \n\nDon\'t take my bearish stance on Spotify to mean that I think the company is poorly run or a bad company. I think Spotify is a GREAT company but I\'ve spoken to three girls this week that exclusively use Apple Music now because it\'s \'convenient\'. Their family plan also seems to have impacted their ability to get individuals to buy accounts because I\'m sharing one with three friends, none of which live under the roof with me. Combined with the fact that Apple Music is indeed growing just as fast as they say it is, and taking market share, I think it\'s only a matter of time before Spotify tops out on growth. The stock isn\'t cheap or competitively priced anything so there has to be really positive news and guidance to go up.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** So it\'s too late to get any options for earnings on this BUT, I can easily play a swing on the report and draw a thesis, even if I\'m wrong. It\'s possible that at open, there\'s still a play to be made but I\'m definitely waiting for the IV to settle down.\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe\'re going to get to those all time highs sooner or later. I hope it\'s sooner because a lot of plays I have are kind of betting on the short term being to the upside above those highs. I think that there\'s piles of opportunities right now, and I think we\'re going to see volatility greatly increase this week and next as May approaches. There\'s little question that the sideways action represents some type of wide-spreading accumulation and consolidation, so the question is will the people accumulating for the next move upwards on the S&amp;P be stronger than those taking profit? If so, we make all time highs and continue cruising. If not? See you in a few weeks 2,700.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it\'s more likely SPY gains that week since it\'s weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it\'s a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it\'s probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Should I Hold Or Sell?\n\nFigure it out on your own. I can\'t tell you what\'s right for you nor do I care to. You have to learn to trade on your own, if this DD doesn\'t get you moving forward enough and you can\'t draw up a plan on how to trade it, then that\'s your problem and trading that stock or trading in general ***may not be for you.*** **To get better at this, play in markets you know well. Don\'t try to find the next Disney, play in stocks that move and behave somewhat rationally, and plan where you\'re entering and where you\'re exiting.**\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don\'t mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there\'s a conversation going on about it already.\n\nIf you\'ve got something you are eyeing, I\'ll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I\'ll simply ignore your comment.\n\n# Private Messages/Chat Requests\n\nI may or may not respond. Depends if the question is stupid or not.\n\n# Holdings Disclaimer\n\nOn listed plays: I am already hold various combinations of positions on Oracle (long/neutral), Microsoft (long), EA (long) and Disney (long).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I\'m going to go through and fix up typos and formatting after I eat pizza and salad and watch GoT.'), ('Me taking selfie before GOOGL earnings.', 'Me taking selfie before GOOGL earnings.'), ('$GOOGL Alphabet earnings thread; Keep all discussion here', '$GOOGL Alphabet earnings thread; Keep all discussion hereEst EPS: $10.38\n\nActual EPS:\n\nEst Revenue: $30.0B\n\nActual Revenue:\n\nBeat on EPS 8 of past 8\n\nBeat on revenue 6 of past 8'), ('THE OFFICIAL JOCO645 WATCHLIST', "THE OFFICIAL JOCO645 WATCHLISTHERE IT IS!

It is also on a confirmed uptrend. \n\nCVS calls- been consolidating for while, CVS has expanded into Target stores, it's more diversified than other retailers. CVS is very low due to sympathy with the Walgreens dip rather than its own merit. CVS has a lot of room to run post earnings.\n\nBP $44.5 calls May 10th- Had a big drop with huge sell off, RSI is extremely low. It will run up into earnings this week.

Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won\'t divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it\'s high and buy IV when it\'s low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don\'t want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low\'s and high\'s, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nA lot of you ask me if I have anywhere outside of here you can follow me on, etc. Follow me on my reddit profile, first of all, that\'s where you\'ll get anything in the future. Yeah I\'m working on a blog and stuff but I\'m a busy dude in real life and it\'s taken a back seat to my real clients and obligations. I\'m still working on it. No, I won\'t share it here - mods have explicitly said no, so leave it there and **don\'t bother them about it.** That being said, I plan on making somewhere to share thoughts outside of this post, yes, it\'s coming, yes, but I\'m busy as fuck with my business(es) and clients, meetings, etc.\n\n# Some Thoughts About Last Week \n\n**What a week it was.** Mostly all the picks last week worked out in real time, same week which isn\'t always the case. Those of you that bought Twitter from a few weeks back on the longer dated option (which I always recommend) probably did pretttttty good with it. These picks don\'t necessarily always start this week, or end this week. These are the ideas that have crafted new trade theories based on what I believe to be true. Entering at the right time is an art, and I\'ve spoken about this so many times but:\n\nI cannot teach you how to trade. Only how to pick things to trade. The trading is the hard part - we\'re not investing -- we\'re trading. Essentially it\'s high level gambling: Knowing when to hold \'em and knowing when to fold \'em is what this game is about.\n\n**Just because a stock is listed here doesn\'t mean you blindly just enter a fucking trade on it.** Look for the entry, look for the catalysts, take advantage of sector moves or other binary events, take advantage of pullbacks or consolidation to look for a price. Set stop limits and don\'t blow your load on weeklies because there\'s very few cases where they work well (Disney anybody).\n\n**The trend is your friend.**\n\n# About Playing Earnings Events\n\nPeople ask how I normally trade earnings, are you selling? are you holding? what are you doing? etc. Here\'s my formula, it may or may not work for you but this is traditionally what I do.\n\nAny earnings events I play, I\'m normally in on the first sign of an uptrend/downtrend in the 2 week window prior to earnings OR I\'m playing by letting earnings dictate the trend, and buying after the IV crush happens.\n\n**THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND.**\n\nRemember: The **ENTIRE** predicating factor in my plays is normally to catch higher periods of volatility at the right time, to profit not only on a move, but on the increase in Vega value of the option. Buying FD\'s the day before an earnings report is the opposite of this and while it SEEMS like it\'s your only way to make a 10-bagger happen, it couldn\'t be further from the truth.\n\nBeing in BEFORE the volatility allows me to simply liquidate a portion of the contracts for a profit, sometimes regardless of it even going slightly against the current price (average doooooown).\n\n**I recommend finding a strategy that works for you and executing it.** If you buy 0-day or front month/front week FD\'s on earnings and lose, you should NOT be surprised. I\'d say you likely are going to lose on 75%+ of those trades, moderately profit on about 90% of the remaining, and pop off on 10% of the remaining 25% (2.5% of the time). Unless you have killer DD or a reason to think the market is pricing in too low of a move, you **CANNOT BEAT THE PRICING MODEL.** For you to win, something has to be wrong, skewed, mis-priced, you must know something about the company that you think analysts/market makers are wrong on, or you have to be advantageously positioned greek wise so that regardless what happens, you win.\n\nResearch **price neutral strategies** (butterflies and calendar spreads, specifically, I hate condors but you can look those up too) if you want a way to be **SHORT VEGA** without investing as much capital. I could write fucking pages on strategies, but I won\'t, and you should learn some about them on your own and fuck them up a few times before you figure out the right places to play them.\n\n**I bolded the words you need to research.** I\'m not commenting anymore on strategy stuff here. Most people still won\'t listen to this anyway, but...\n\n**A specific example:** I bought June MSFT $145 calls at $0.04 a piece, 40 of them, and then a chunk of $135\'s throughout the last couple days of the week before earnings. My scans showed that they were mis-priced and skewed, you couldn\'t have known this, but you can easily just by using intuition find these kinds of deals. They exist, trust me. Those $145 calls are now like $0.15 I think? But they were also $0.12 right before earnings, both because of the move up, but secondarily because of the Vega pump on the options. They barely moved in value after earnings, as the crush offset a lot of the price movement. I sold half (20) the day before earnings for 200%, and basically freerolled the rest. I sold a chunk between $0.14 and $0.16 after earnings, and still have 10 of them that I will iron fist until they go to 0 or make a grand or so. The trade is already profitable, I\'ve locked that in, and I get to ride the lotto ticket on the house. I have two months to watch and decide if I really want to let them wipe themselves out or just take some more cash and move on.\n\n**Buying price directional and holding, mathematically modeled, is a losing strategy when used by itself with no other factors taken into effect.** The smart traders will see this statement for what it means, others will see it to mean that you can\'t buy directional plays. The ones that see it the first way are learning how to trade, the ones that see it the other way are the gamblers.\n\n# Results On Last Week\'s Picks\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $122.62, Closed: $129.89, High: $131.37\n\n* Win. We know all about the good news and movement, I think it still has room to go but it\'s definitely going to find consolidation near 130 and chill for even another day or two longer than it has before it continues up. Pullback to 128-127 doesn\'t concern me and I\'ll just hold all my calls regardless. Looking at the movement of it, it\'s not completely out of the question to see one after earnings. I\'d feel comfortable just bag holding my June calls until probably the middle of May, if it\'s still flat then, I feel like the cushion I\'ve built is worth the risk for more upside here. I don\'t imagine it crashing down to 115 or anything, unless the entire market comes down with it.\n\n**Verizon (VZ) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $58.14, Closed: $56.58, H: $58.49 (pointless, as it was pre-market)\n\n* Yeah so they beat or whatever but it\'s a telecom company and their guidance was meh and the results were meh. I lost 60% on this trade, and just decided I\'d rather not watch for it or navigate it anymore. Can\'t win them all.\n\n**UnitedHealth (UNH) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $224.00, Closed: $237, H: $237.11\n\n* ***I got really lucky here.*** The timing was just pure luck that it occurred the week I listed it but it popped off and rose pretty much all week. I think that it\'s probably going to continue the trend as long as there\'s volume behind it because of the reasons listed last week: The assets and forward looking potential revenue are not reflected in the stock\'s price. \n\n**Tesla (TSLA) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $269.00, Closed: $235.14, L: $231.13\n\n* **This one made me feel like a prophet.** Let\'s quote myself: "It\'s always just a matter of time before they go back to $230 because of a car blowing up or somebody saying something stupid." $230ish? Check. Tesla exploded? Check. Tesla said stupid things about leaf blowers? Check. Print print print.\n\n**Facebook (FB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $178.25, Closed: $191.49, H: $198.48\n\n* Facebook had really stellar numbers in my opinion. Eventually, growth in USA has to stall and it did. The international numbers were fine, and the fact they\'re taking the front looking "Let\'s fight the privacy battle together" stance is great for sentiment and allows fund managers to freely continue piling into shares if they want to without their clients going SJW on them. I think the pullback is, well, whatever. People taking profit as they climb back near where they were last year, so wait for some high volume trading and an increase in price and this one still has room to make money. Sold half my calls for like 100%+ and the other half for a -2% loss because I held through the fall from grace for a day or two.\n\n**Intel (INTC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $58.15, Closed: $52.43, H: $59.29\n\n* Buy the dip in my opinion. Not gonna say much else here but the semis are under pressure -- but I think Intel is more isolated from the general semi companies solely because they\'ll always sell chips. Some of the old 1080ti cards that Nvidia sold are still running perfect and strong and the new gen offers an increase but not as incremental as people wanted. That being said, I think Nvidia is fine but they\'re a lot more prone to slowdowns than a company like Intel. I don\'t know when they\'ll stabilize, could be days or weeks, but when they do I\'d look to profit on the move back up. China trade deal could be a big catalyst proxy play here.\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 29th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself.** Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I\'m considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.  I may or may not enter trades on these or may already be in them. The bottom of the post has the options I\'m long on, as a secondary holding disclaimer.\n\nThere was a witch hunt in the Daily Discussion thread claiming I retroactively edit my posts HAHA like I give a fuck or something... I called Twitter, I don\'t really care what anybody says. Feels good from my side, BRAH. I don\'t list every play I make, just the ones I feel like the community would be most interested in playing. I don\'t mention the premium I may be selling (but will list it if it\'s on any of the options listed) and I don\'t mention any other neutral strategies I\'m holding if they\'re not in these stocks.\n\nI typed less commentary about each stock because there\'s so many this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) - $129.89 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Trend is your friend (anybody see a theme here?). Consolidation commencing, I plan on just holding my calls. Ride the wave. Numbers are good, Azure is growing, and if somehow before June that JEDI contract gets handed out and they get it, it goes up, hard and fast just the way I like it.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Holding my calls. Maybe adding more that are 10% or so OTM but knowing full well I may lose on them because it has to move, but if it does the payoff seems pretty immense and Mickey like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oracle (ORCL) - $55.41 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* For me, Oracle is kind of a proxy play and a momentum play. \n\nThere has been a pretty nice sized volume move on Oracle as of late and some of the bigger funds are adding to their holdings. The fact that Oracle is pretty cloud-driven, besides their enterprise on-site data storage (which is very much likely moving towards cloud based offerings) and that the data sector and cloud industry is booming ($TEAM anybody? Looks like it\'s climbing right back where it was after the ridiculous earnings selloff) I think it means they have a chance to start increasing market share. As a result, as more and more people buy into this theory, the price will rise as a forward looking idea and price it in. For me, the price is $56, if it can get over that and close there, the swing play is in full effect for me. It\'s right at new 52W highs and to me (trend, friend) and with any luck, the volume will hold up and we\'ll see it plow upwards further.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Specifically, some May monthly contracts at various strikes. Pick your poison, ROI comes with more risk, so the further out, the more risk. I\'m pretty likely to just buy right ATM, and double down on some out of the money ones if it starts going for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $178.09 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* BUYYYY THEEEE DIPPPPP. \n\nI am completely ignoring any \'market sector weakness\' people are talking about in semis. It\'s cyclical, yes, and that\'s something to be cognizant of. I\'m going to wait for the price to stabilize Monday and wait and see if any binary news pops its head out, orange man says something about China, etc. and make a decision if I want to enter or keep waiting. Ideally, it will go down even more, because Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. are going to be hugeeeeee benefactors to the trade deal news. **They report 5/16 and the fact the stock really hasn\'t moved much on a 2 month rolling basis, there seems to be upside on the idea of China, in and of itself.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Calls, various strikes, might even consider weeklies here because I\'m playing it as a swing. I don\'t want to personally throw a few thousand at like 2020 calls and have to let them sit there to profit 100%. I\'d rather just take a few shots at weeklies, or front month stuff, and see if I can catch a swing and just be appropriate each day or two and close out positions that are moving towards 20-50% losses, and take a few shots at it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disney (DIS) - $139.92 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* It\'s Mickey, mother fuckers. \n\nSaw Endgame, movie was pretty badass. They\'re going to enter a string of great movies, with Lion King also coming this year. Could they sell the news Monday? Sure, but idgaf. Mickey\'s my bro and I ride or die with him. If you don\'t know the updates here with Disney+ and what not, you\'re out of the loop and you should stop trading options. Nuff said imo. **They report next week, so it\'s important to pay attention to the fact that earnings and guidance COULD disappoint versus the share price at the time, and trigger a fat pullback. It\'s all risk/reward.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Throw a dart at a list of price strikes and buy them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Electronic Arts (EA) - $94.47 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- We talked about this one a week ago? I think. Or two weeks. \n\nEither way, it started to find that bottom entry point. People keep asking if I\'m concerned about Anthem. Those that are asking that I assume are gaming enthusiasts that watch a lot of clickbait YouTube videos and pay too much attention to what some random neckbeard think about the games that come out. The company made a killing on Apex (BUT THE BATTLE PASS!!!!! OMG, same shit, just shut up because people still bought it) and the number of people that I saw buying in game currency BEFORE the battle pass is immense. \n\nThey could not have imagined that they got to the player base they did so fast and more importantly the stock did not drop because of ANY of these reasons. It dropped because of the Origin security flaw. Flaw\'s fixed. Price hasn\'t gone back up. Not priced in. **They report NEXT WEEK so if I\'m going to up my position it will be this week, not next.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** June or even later calls. I\'m spread from strikes currently 115-125. I might even go deeper in the chain and bet on insane action in the next month. Depends how spicy I feel and whether Taco Tuesday is any good this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ) - $71.55 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report Wednesday after market.** A lot of people have heard me talk about this company. I **LOVE** Square. They have good tech and a good platform. I know that they\'re expanding their service offerings and improving on the software they acquired from Freshbooks. \n\nTheir appointments app is their bread and butter besides the payments fees, and the hardware sales help to push profits higher also. They just got me for like $600? I think or more even for a new iPad/stand setup. It just works well. This segways me to mention that if and when Stripe comes into the market as far as IPOs, be careful about being in Square or PayPal. Stripe is going to fucking crush it, they are the holy grail fintech company in my opinion.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Kind of sketch to get in now if you aren\'t, so I may just sell premium on these and then buy upside calls with the profits after earnings, but I\'m not 100% yet. I\'ll probably YOLO in on weeklies or something just because I can\'t help myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alaska Air (ALK) - $60.62 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* They just ate some price target cuts after earnings but I feel like analysts are pricing in the idea of a wide market pullback and the impacts of Boeing on the company. That being said I really like Alaska as a company and when I do fly, it\'s normally Alaska anywhere I go. Their price target cuts are still 15% or so above where the stock sits, and if the entire sector gets any type of positive news, they\'ll pop up along with Delta ($DAL) and Southwest ($LUV).\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** June or July\'s, trying to pick the strike that I feel they can reach, not surpass, and then selling a large portion of my position if they approach the price closely. In my opinion and modeling, $70.52 is the price my algorithm spit out at me. I won\'t say what goes into it, and I won\'t say what variables I set as the projection so don\'t ask, **and it means ABSOLUTELY nothing** but I just hate going against my computer because it turns into a snarky bitch when it\'s right and I\'m wrong. Either way, seems like the options aren\'t that pricy, although the spreads are kind of fucked on these. If you don\'t get a good fill on a dip at open when the bid spread crashes and rips the ask price down with it, then you probably won\'t find an advantageous position here. It\'s more lotto ticket than buying FD\'s on Square, honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Exxon Mobil (XOM) - $80.49 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* While the rest of the oil sector is buying itself up and combining companies into conglomerates even further, Exxon has shown some decided weakness and off their last earnings report, I\'d be willing to say we see a dip here that I\'m willing to jump on the train for. \n\nIt all depends on risk tolerance though because I\'m kind of betting against a hot market with where oil prices are at and it\'s completely possible the market 100% ignores everything that is out there on the company and is completely irrational and the price just goes up. Sure, crude pulled back but it\'s still way above where it was in recent months, so to me, that would signal that guidance for these companies could be getting sandbagged for the next round of earnings, so keep this in mind because they probably aren\'t re-working guidance based on oil pricing fluctuations but rather a range and probability model of the prices in certain economic conditions in similar years.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Another spot where I\'m willing to sling a bit at a 3-5% move on weeklies for puts because they\'re really not that expensive and people/algos will freak out over the Trump ceiling on the oil market. I\'m personally considering following up the weeklies with some that are longer expiration, at a deeper strike, and rolling my weeklies along the way until I decide I\'ve lost/made enough on the trade. Oil markets kind of a bitch sometimes and I have a slight vendetta against it for life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Occidental (OXY) - $61.31 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* I\'m going against the grain with this company because they continually are in the news and have allowed themselves to enter a bidding war with Chevron now over Anadarko. \n\nChevron will likely win this battle for the reason that I have a inkling that there\'s some options written into the deal for executives which would explain why they may take a lower priced offer for the company. If this happens, it will make Occidental appear snubbed and like a bitch, and thus, the price will go down because shareholders will lose faith in the ability of the board to get a deal done. Moreover, they\'ve raised their bid and showed they\'re willing to pay more, so Chevron could bid this way the fuck up and if the bidding war doesn\'t stop -- shareholders traditionally don\'t like a company paying way more for something just because someone bullied them into it.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** This is another play I like shorter term holdings on. I\'ll probably buy puts and hold for a day or two, and roll some profits if they win or pick a different entry. I\'d like to see lower volume on the day or timeframe I decide to enter, it would show me people aren\'t really trading it and stockholders or algo\'s could sell it off in anticipation of the entire situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify (SPOT) - $138.25 -** ***BEARISH*** \\- **They report tomorrow before market.** \n\nDon\'t take my bearish stance on Spotify to mean that I think the company is poorly run or a bad company. I think Spotify is a GREAT company but I\'ve spoken to three girls this week that exclusively use Apple Music now because it\'s \'convenient\'. Their family plan also seems to have impacted their ability to get individuals to buy accounts because I\'m sharing one with three friends, none of which live under the roof with me. Combined with the fact that Apple Music is indeed growing just as fast as they say it is, and taking market share, I think it\'s only a matter of time before Spotify tops out on growth. The stock isn\'t cheap or competitively priced anything so there has to be really positive news and guidance to go up.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** So it\'s too late to get any options for earnings on this BUT, I can easily play a swing on the report and draw a thesis, even if I\'m wrong. It\'s possible that at open, there\'s still a play to be made but I\'m definitely waiting for the IV to settle down.\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe\'re going to get to those all time highs sooner or later. I hope it\'s sooner because a lot of plays I have are kind of betting on the short term being to the upside above those highs. I think that there\'s piles of opportunities right now, and I think we\'re going to see volatility greatly increase this week and next as May approaches. There\'s little question that the sideways action represents some type of wide-spreading accumulation and consolidation, so the question is will the people accumulating for the next move upwards on the S&amp;P be stronger than those taking profit? If so, we make all time highs and continue cruising. If not? See you in a few weeks 2,700.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it\'s more likely SPY gains that week since it\'s weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it\'s a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it\'s probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Should I Hold Or Sell?\n\nFigure it out on your own. I can\'t tell you what\'s right for you nor do I care to. You have to learn to trade on your own, if this DD doesn\'t get you moving forward enough and you can\'t draw up a plan on how to trade it, then that\'s your problem and trading that stock or trading in general ***may not be for you.*** **To get better at this, play in markets you know well. Don\'t try to find the next Disney, play in stocks that move and behave somewhat rationally, and plan where you\'re entering and where you\'re exiting.**\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don\'t mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there\'s a conversation going on about it already.\n\nIf you\'ve got something you are eyeing, I\'ll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I\'ll simply ignore your comment.\n\n# Private Messages/Chat Requests\n\nI may or may not respond. Depends if the question is stupid or not.\n\n# Holdings Disclaimer\n\nOn listed plays: I am already hold various combinations of positions on Oracle (long/neutral), Microsoft (long), EA (long) and Disney (long).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I\'m going to go through and fix up typos and formatting after I eat pizza and salad and watch GoT.'), ('THE OFFICIAL JOCO645 WATCHLIST', "THE OFFICIAL JOCO645 WATCHLISTHERE IT IS!

ER is coming this week and it will likely beat earnings. It is also on a confirmed uptrend. \n\nCVS calls- been consolidating for while, CVS has expanded into Target stores, it's more diversified than other retailers. CVS is very low due to sympathy with the Walgreens dip rather than its own merit. CVS has a lot of room to run post earnings.\n\nBP $44.5 calls May 10th- Had a big drop with huge sell off, RSI is extremely low. It will run up into earnings this week. I’d recommend selling right before ER for this one. XOM had a bad ER, BP’s ER could reflect the same. \n\nGE $10 calls May 10th- High risk high reward play 50/50 chance. The expectations are already extremely low. If it can beat expectations there could be an 8% upwards move. Expectations shouldn't be hard to beat. Overall GE is a shit company and I wouldn’t hold this for long.\n\nPFE  $41 calls May 10th- Earnings have historically been good for the Q1 ER. Stock is on an uptrend. \n\nAMD $31 calls May 10th- Playstation 5 confirmed they’re using AMD’s chips. ER could miss or beat. The main thing going for AMD is guidance will likely be raised due to the playstation deal. \n\nAMGN $190 May 10th- RSI solid, MACD confirmed uptrend, above the line of resistance.

Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won\'t divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it\'s high and buy IV when it\'s low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don\'t want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low\'s and high\'s, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nA lot of you ask me if I have anywhere outside of here you can follow me on, etc. Follow me on my reddit profile, first of all, that\'s where you\'ll get anything in the future. Yeah I\'m working on a blog and stuff but I\'m a busy dude in real life and it\'s taken a back seat to my real clients and obligations. I\'m still working on it. No, I won\'t share it here - mods have explicitly said no, so leave it there and **don\'t bother them about it.** That being said, I plan on making somewhere to share thoughts outside of this post, yes, it\'s coming, yes, but I\'m busy as fuck with my business(es) and clients, meetings, etc.\n\n# Some Thoughts About Last Week \n\n**What a week it was.** Mostly all the picks last week worked out in real time, same week which isn\'t always the case. Those of you that bought Twitter from a few weeks back on the longer dated option (which I always recommend) probably did pretttttty good with it. These picks don\'t necessarily always start this week, or end this week. These are the ideas that have crafted new trade theories based on what I believe to be true. Entering at the right time is an art, and I\'ve spoken about this so many times but:\n\nI cannot teach you how to trade. Only how to pick things to trade. The trading is the hard part - we\'re not investing -- we\'re trading. Essentially it\'s high level gambling: Knowing when to hold \'em and knowing when to fold \'em is what this game is about.\n\n**Just because a stock is listed here doesn\'t mean you blindly just enter a fucking trade on it.** Look for the entry, look for the catalysts, take advantage of sector moves or other binary events, take advantage of pullbacks or consolidation to look for a price. Set stop limits and don\'t blow your load on weeklies because there\'s very few cases where they work well (Disney anybody).\n\n**The trend is your friend.**\n\n# About Playing Earnings Events\n\nPeople ask how I normally trade earnings, are you selling? are you holding? what are you doing? etc. Here\'s my formula, it may or may not work for you but this is traditionally what I do.\n\nAny earnings events I play, I\'m normally in on the first sign of an uptrend/downtrend in the 2 week window prior to earnings OR I\'m playing by letting earnings dictate the trend, and buying after the IV crush happens.\n\n**THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND.**\n\nRemember: The **ENTIRE** predicating factor in my plays is normally to catch higher periods of volatility at the right time, to profit not only on a move, but on the increase in Vega value of the option. Buying FD\'s the day before an earnings report is the opposite of this and while it SEEMS like it\'s your only way to make a 10-bagger happen, it couldn\'t be further from the truth.\n\nBeing in BEFORE the volatility allows me to simply liquidate a portion of the contracts for a profit, sometimes regardless of it even going slightly against the current price (average doooooown).\n\n**I recommend finding a strategy that works for you and executing it.** If you buy 0-day or front month/front week FD\'s on earnings and lose, you should NOT be surprised. I\'d say you likely are going to lose on 75%+ of those trades, moderately profit on about 90% of the remaining, and pop off on 10% of the remaining 25% (2.5% of the time). Unless you have killer DD or a reason to think the market is pricing in too low of a move, you **CANNOT BEAT THE PRICING MODEL.** For you to win, something has to be wrong, skewed, mis-priced, you must know something about the company that you think analysts/market makers are wrong on, or you have to be advantageously positioned greek wise so that regardless what happens, you win.\n\nResearch **price neutral strategies** (butterflies and calendar spreads, specifically, I hate condors but you can look those up too) if you want a way to be **SHORT VEGA** without investing as much capital. I could write fucking pages on strategies, but I won\'t, and you should learn some about them on your own and fuck them up a few times before you figure out the right places to play them.\n\n**I bolded the words you need to research.** I\'m not commenting anymore on strategy stuff here. Most people still won\'t listen to this anyway, but...\n\n**A specific example:** I bought June MSFT $145 calls at $0.04 a piece, 40 of them, and then a chunk of $135\'s throughout the last couple days of the week before earnings. My scans showed that they were mis-priced and skewed, you couldn\'t have known this, but you can easily just by using intuition find these kinds of deals. They exist, trust me. Those $145 calls are now like $0.15 I think? But they were also $0.12 right before earnings, both because of the move up, but secondarily because of the Vega pump on the options. They barely moved in value after earnings, as the crush offset a lot of the price movement. I sold half (20) the day before earnings for 200%, and basically freerolled the rest. I sold a chunk between $0.14 and $0.16 after earnings, and still have 10 of them that I will iron fist until they go to 0 or make a grand or so. The trade is already profitable, I\'ve locked that in, and I get to ride the lotto ticket on the house. I have two months to watch and decide if I really want to let them wipe themselves out or just take some more cash and move on.\n\n**Buying price directional and holding, mathematically modeled, is a losing strategy when used by itself with no other factors taken into effect.** The smart traders will see this statement for what it means, others will see it to mean that you can\'t buy directional plays. The ones that see it the first way are learning how to trade, the ones that see it the other way are the gamblers.\n\n# Results On Last Week\'s Picks\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $122.62, Closed: $129.89, High: $131.37\n\n* Win. We know all about the good news and movement, I think it still has room to go but it\'s definitely going to find consolidation near 130 and chill for even another day or two longer than it has before it continues up. Pullback to 128-127 doesn\'t concern me and I\'ll just hold all my calls regardless. Looking at the movement of it, it\'s not completely out of the question to see one after earnings. I\'d feel comfortable just bag holding my June calls until probably the middle of May, if it\'s still flat then, I feel like the cushion I\'ve built is worth the risk for more upside here. I don\'t imagine it crashing down to 115 or anything, unless the entire market comes down with it.\n\n**Verizon (VZ) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $58.14, Closed: $56.58, H: $58.49 (pointless, as it was pre-market)\n\n* Yeah so they beat or whatever but it\'s a telecom company and their guidance was meh and the results were meh. I lost 60% on this trade, and just decided I\'d rather not watch for it or navigate it anymore. Can\'t win them all.\n\n**UnitedHealth (UNH) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $224.00, Closed: $237, H: $237.11\n\n* ***I got really lucky here.*** The timing was just pure luck that it occurred the week I listed it but it popped off and rose pretty much all week. I think that it\'s probably going to continue the trend as long as there\'s volume behind it because of the reasons listed last week: The assets and forward looking potential revenue are not reflected in the stock\'s price. \n\n**Tesla (TSLA) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $269.00, Closed: $235.14, L: $231.13\n\n* **This one made me feel like a prophet.** Let\'s quote myself: "It\'s always just a matter of time before they go back to $230 because of a car blowing up or somebody saying something stupid." $230ish? Check. Tesla exploded? Check. Tesla said stupid things about leaf blowers? Check. Print print print.\n\n**Facebook (FB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $178.25, Closed: $191.49, H: $198.48\n\n* Facebook had really stellar numbers in my opinion. Eventually, growth in USA has to stall and it did. The international numbers were fine, and the fact they\'re taking the front looking "Let\'s fight the privacy battle together" stance is great for sentiment and allows fund managers to freely continue piling into shares if they want to without their clients going SJW on them. I think the pullback is, well, whatever. People taking profit as they climb back near where they were last year, so wait for some high volume trading and an increase in price and this one still has room to make money. Sold half my calls for like 100%+ and the other half for a -2% loss because I held through the fall from grace for a day or two.\n\n**Intel (INTC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $58.15, Closed: $52.43, H: $59.29\n\n* Buy the dip in my opinion. Not gonna say much else here but the semis are under pressure -- but I think Intel is more isolated from the general semi companies solely because they\'ll always sell chips. Some of the old 1080ti cards that Nvidia sold are still running perfect and strong and the new gen offers an increase but not as incremental as people wanted. That being said, I think Nvidia is fine but they\'re a lot more prone to slowdowns than a company like Intel. I don\'t know when they\'ll stabilize, could be days or weeks, but when they do I\'d look to profit on the move back up. China trade deal could be a big catalyst proxy play here.\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 29th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself.** Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I\'m considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.  I may or may not enter trades on these or may already be in them. The bottom of the post has the options I\'m long on, as a secondary holding disclaimer.\n\nThere was a witch hunt in the Daily Discussion thread claiming I retroactively edit my posts HAHA like I give a fuck or something... I called Twitter, I don\'t really care what anybody says. Feels good from my side, BRAH. I don\'t list every play I make, just the ones I feel like the community would be most interested in playing. I don\'t mention the premium I may be selling (but will list it if it\'s on any of the options listed) and I don\'t mention any other neutral strategies I\'m holding if they\'re not in these stocks.\n\nI typed less commentary about each stock because there\'s so many this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) - $129.89 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Trend is your friend (anybody see a theme here?). Consolidation commencing, I plan on just holding my calls. Ride the wave. Numbers are good, Azure is growing, and if somehow before June that JEDI contract gets handed out and they get it, it goes up, hard and fast just the way I like it.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Holding my calls. Maybe adding more that are 10% or so OTM but knowing full well I may lose on them because it has to move, but if it does the payoff seems pretty immense and Mickey like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oracle (ORCL) - $55.41 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* For me, Oracle is kind of a proxy play and a momentum play. \n\nThere has been a pretty nice sized volume move on Oracle as of late and some of the bigger funds are adding to their holdings. The fact that Oracle is pretty cloud-driven, besides their enterprise on-site data storage (which is very much likely moving towards cloud based offerings) and that the data sector and cloud industry is booming ($TEAM anybody? Looks like it\'s climbing right back where it was after the ridiculous earnings selloff) I think it means they have a chance to start increasing market share. As a result, as more and more people buy into this theory, the price will rise as a forward looking idea and price it in. For me, the price is $56, if it can get over that and close there, the swing play is in full effect for me. It\'s right at new 52W highs and to me (trend, friend) and with any luck, the volume will hold up and we\'ll see it plow upwards further.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Specifically, some May monthly contracts at various strikes. Pick your poison, ROI comes with more risk, so the further out, the more risk. I\'m pretty likely to just buy right ATM, and double down on some out of the money ones if it starts going for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $178.09 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* BUYYYY THEEEE DIPPPPP. \n\nI am completely ignoring any \'market sector weakness\' people are talking about in semis. It\'s cyclical, yes, and that\'s something to be cognizant of. I\'m going to wait for the price to stabilize Monday and wait and see if any binary news pops its head out, orange man says something about China, etc. and make a decision if I want to enter or keep waiting. Ideally, it will go down even more, because Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. are going to be hugeeeeee benefactors to the trade deal news. **They report 5/16 and the fact the stock really hasn\'t moved much on a 2 month rolling basis, there seems to be upside on the idea of China, in and of itself.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Calls, various strikes, might even consider weeklies here because I\'m playing it as a swing. I don\'t want to personally throw a few thousand at like 2020 calls and have to let them sit there to profit 100%. I\'d rather just take a few shots at weeklies, or front month stuff, and see if I can catch a swing and just be appropriate each day or two and close out positions that are moving towards 20-50% losses, and take a few shots at it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disney (DIS) - $139.92 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* It\'s Mickey, mother fuckers. \n\nSaw Endgame, movie was pretty badass. They\'re going to enter a string of great movies, with Lion King also coming this year. Could they sell the news Monday? Sure, but idgaf. Mickey\'s my bro and I ride or die with him. If you don\'t know the updates here with Disney+ and what not, you\'re out of the loop and you should stop trading options. Nuff said imo. **They report next week, so it\'s important to pay attention to the fact that earnings and guidance COULD disappoint versus the share price at the time, and trigger a fat pullback. It\'s all risk/reward.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Throw a dart at a list of price strikes and buy them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Electronic Arts (EA) - $94.47 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- We talked about this one a week ago? I think. Or two weeks. \n\nEither way, it started to find that bottom entry point. People keep asking if I\'m concerned about Anthem. Those that are asking that I assume are gaming enthusiasts that watch a lot of clickbait YouTube videos and pay too much attention to what some random neckbeard think about the games that come out. The company made a killing on Apex (BUT THE BATTLE PASS!!!!! OMG, same shit, just shut up because people still bought it) and the number of people that I saw buying in game currency BEFORE the battle pass is immense. \n\nThey could not have imagined that they got to the player base they did so fast and more importantly the stock did not drop because of ANY of these reasons. It dropped because of the Origin security flaw. Flaw\'s fixed. Price hasn\'t gone back up. Not priced in. **They report NEXT WEEK so if I\'m going to up my position it will be this week, not next.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** June or even later calls. I\'m spread from strikes currently 115-125. I might even go deeper in the chain and bet on insane action in the next month. Depends how spicy I feel and whether Taco Tuesday is any good this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ) - $71.55 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report Wednesday after market.** A lot of people have heard me talk about this company. I **LOVE** Square. They have good tech and a good platform. I know that they\'re expanding their service offerings and improving on the software they acquired from Freshbooks. \n\nTheir appointments app is their bread and butter besides the payments fees, and the hardware sales help to push profits higher also. They just got me for like $600? I think or more even for a new iPad/stand setup. It just works well. This segways me to mention that if and when Stripe comes into the market as far as IPOs, be careful about being in Square or PayPal. Stripe is going to fucking crush it, they are the holy grail fintech company in my opinion.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Kind of sketch to get in now if you aren\'t, so I may just sell premium on these and then buy upside calls with the profits after earnings, but I\'m not 100% yet. I\'ll probably YOLO in on weeklies or something just because I can\'t help myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alaska Air (ALK) - $60.62 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* They just ate some price target cuts after earnings but I feel like analysts are pricing in the idea of a wide market pullback and the impacts of Boeing on the company. That being said I really like Alaska as a company and when I do fly, it\'s normally Alaska anywhere I go. Their price target cuts are still 15% or so above where the stock sits, and if the entire sector gets any type of positive news, they\'ll pop up along with Delta ($DAL) and Southwest ($LUV).\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** June or July\'s, trying to pick the strike that I feel they can reach, not surpass, and then selling a large portion of my position if they approach the price closely. In my opinion and modeling, $70.52 is the price my algorithm spit out at me. I won\'t say what goes into it, and I won\'t say what variables I set as the projection so don\'t ask, **and it means ABSOLUTELY nothing** but I just hate going against my computer because it turns into a snarky bitch when it\'s right and I\'m wrong. Either way, seems like the options aren\'t that pricy, although the spreads are kind of fucked on these. If you don\'t get a good fill on a dip at open when the bid spread crashes and rips the ask price down with it, then you probably won\'t find an advantageous position here. It\'s more lotto ticket than buying FD\'s on Square, honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Exxon Mobil (XOM) - $80.49 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* While the rest of the oil sector is buying itself up and combining companies into conglomerates even further, Exxon has shown some decided weakness and off their last earnings report, I\'d be willing to say we see a dip here that I\'m willing to jump on the train for. \n\nIt all depends on risk tolerance though because I\'m kind of betting against a hot market with where oil prices are at and it\'s completely possible the market 100% ignores everything that is out there on the company and is completely irrational and the price just goes up. Sure, crude pulled back but it\'s still way above where it was in recent months, so to me, that would signal that guidance for these companies could be getting sandbagged for the next round of earnings, so keep this in mind because they probably aren\'t re-working guidance based on oil pricing fluctuations but rather a range and probability model of the prices in certain economic conditions in similar years.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Another spot where I\'m willing to sling a bit at a 3-5% move on weeklies for puts because they\'re really not that expensive and people/algos will freak out over the Trump ceiling on the oil market. I\'m personally considering following up the weeklies with some that are longer expiration, at a deeper strike, and rolling my weeklies along the way until I decide I\'ve lost/made enough on the trade. Oil markets kind of a bitch sometimes and I have a slight vendetta against it for life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Occidental (OXY) - $61.31 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* I\'m going against the grain with this company because they continually are in the news and have allowed themselves to enter a bidding war with Chevron now over Anadarko. \n\nChevron will likely win this battle for the reason that I have a inkling that there\'s some options written into the deal for executives which would explain why they may take a lower priced offer for the company. If this happens, it will make Occidental appear snubbed and like a bitch, and thus, the price will go down because shareholders will lose faith in the ability of the board to get a deal done. Moreover, they\'ve raised their bid and showed they\'re willing to pay more, so Chevron could bid this way the fuck up and if the bidding war doesn\'t stop -- shareholders traditionally don\'t like a company paying way more for something just because someone bullied them into it.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** This is another play I like shorter term holdings on. I\'ll probably buy puts and hold for a day or two, and roll some profits if they win or pick a different entry. I\'d like to see lower volume on the day or timeframe I decide to enter, it would show me people aren\'t really trading it and stockholders or algo\'s could sell it off in anticipation of the entire situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify (SPOT) - $138.25 -** ***BEARISH*** \\- **They report tomorrow before market.** \n\nDon\'t take my bearish stance on Spotify to mean that I think the company is poorly run or a bad company. I think Spotify is a GREAT company but I\'ve spoken to three girls this week that exclusively use Apple Music now because it\'s \'convenient\'. Their family plan also seems to have impacted their ability to get individuals to buy accounts because I\'m sharing one with three friends, none of which live under the roof with me. Combined with the fact that Apple Music is indeed growing just as fast as they say it is, and taking market share, I think it\'s only a matter of time before Spotify tops out on growth. The stock isn\'t cheap or competitively priced anything so there has to be really positive news and guidance to go up.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** So it\'s too late to get any options for earnings on this BUT, I can easily play a swing on the report and draw a thesis, even if I\'m wrong. It\'s possible that at open, there\'s still a play to be made but I\'m definitely waiting for the IV to settle down.\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe\'re going to get to those all time highs sooner or later. I hope it\'s sooner because a lot of plays I have are kind of betting on the short term being to the upside above those highs. I think that there\'s piles of opportunities right now, and I think we\'re going to see volatility greatly increase this week and next as May approaches. There\'s little question that the sideways action represents some type of wide-spreading accumulation and consolidation, so the question is will the people accumulating for the next move upwards on the S&amp;P be stronger than those taking profit? If so, we make all time highs and continue cruising. If not? See you in a few weeks 2,700.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it\'s more likely SPY gains that week since it\'s weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it\'s a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it\'s probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Should I Hold Or Sell?\n\nFigure it out on your own. I can\'t tell you what\'s right for you nor do I care to. You have to learn to trade on your own, if this DD doesn\'t get you moving forward enough and you can\'t draw up a plan on how to trade it, then that\'s your problem and trading that stock or trading in general ***may not be for you.*** **To get better at this, play in markets you know well. Don\'t try to find the next Disney, play in stocks that move and behave somewhat rationally, and plan where you\'re entering and where you\'re exiting.**\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don\'t mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there\'s a conversation going on about it already.\n\nIf you\'ve got something you are eyeing, I\'ll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I\'ll simply ignore your comment.\n\n# Private Messages/Chat Requests\n\nI may or may not respond. Depends if the question is stupid or not.\n\n# Holdings Disclaimer\n\nOn listed plays: I am already hold various combinations of positions on Oracle (long/neutral), Microsoft (long), EA (long) and Disney (long).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I\'m going to go through and fix up typos and formatting after I eat pizza and salad and watch GoT.'), ('THE OFFICIAL JOCO645 WATCHLIST', "THE OFFICIAL JOCO645 WATCHLISTHERE IT IS! I DARE YOU TO BET AGAINST THIS! WAIT TILL THE END OF THE WEEK, AFTER ALL THE DUST SETTLES YOU WILL ALL FINALLY SEE THAT I AM A GOOD TRADER!\n\n\n\nAMC 16.5 calls May 3rd- Highest sales ever with end game, It might be a good idea to buy shares premarket monday if you want to harness the full pop.\n\nMRK $79 calls May 10th- The stock bottomed out on April 18th. ER is coming this week and it will likely beat earnings. It is also on a confirmed uptrend. \n\nCVS calls- been consolidating for while, CVS has expanded into Target stores, it's more diversified than other retailers. CVS is very low due to sympathy with the Walgreens dip rather than its own merit. CVS has a lot of room to run post earnings.\n\nBP $44.5 calls May 10th- Had a big drop with huge sell off, RSI is extremely low. It will run up into earnings this week. I’d recommend selling right before ER for this one. XOM had a bad ER, BP’s ER could reflect the same. \n\nGE $10 calls May 10th- High risk high reward play 50/50 chance. The expectations are already extremely low. If it can beat expectations there could be an 8% upwards move. Expectations shouldn't be hard to beat. Overall GE is a shit company and I wouldn’t hold this for long.\n\nPFE  $41 calls May 10th- Earnings have historically been good for the Q1 ER. Stock is on an uptrend. \n\nAMD $31 calls May 10th- Playstation 5 confirmed they’re using AMD’s chips. ER could miss or beat. The main thing going for AMD is guidance will likely be raised due to the playstation deal. \n\nAMGN $190 May 10th- RSI solid, MACD confirmed uptrend, above the line of resistance. Will likely beat earnings.\n\n\nYou can thank me for making you a fuck ton of money here: gf.me/u/sg8uw4"), ("I pick options so you don't have to [Week beginning April 29th, 2019]", 'I pick options so you don\'t have to [Week beginning April 29th, 2019]**Disclaimer:** This is not investment advice, all the information herein is simply opinion of the author and should be viewed as such. **Options investing is risky and volatile, and** **you should be prepared and able to sustain 100% loss of any capital invested.** This post and replies by author do not take into account any individual’s personal situation or circumstances and is not advice to any individual person.

Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews. These are my own scripts, and I won\'t divulge much more than that about it. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it\'s high and buy IV when it\'s low, follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don\'t want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low\'s and high\'s, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nA lot of you ask me if I have anywhere outside of here you can follow me on, etc. Follow me on my reddit profile, first of all, that\'s where you\'ll get anything in the future. Yeah I\'m working on a blog and stuff but I\'m a busy dude in real life and it\'s taken a back seat to my real clients and obligations. I\'m still working on it. No, I won\'t share it here - mods have explicitly said no, so leave it there and **don\'t bother them about it.** That being said, I plan on making somewhere to share thoughts outside of this post, yes, it\'s coming, yes, but I\'m busy as fuck with my business(es) and clients, meetings, etc.\n\n# Some Thoughts About Last Week \n\n**What a week it was.** Mostly all the picks last week worked out in real time, same week which isn\'t always the case. Those of you that bought Twitter from a few weeks back on the longer dated option (which I always recommend) probably did pretttttty good with it. These picks don\'t necessarily always start this week, or end this week. These are the ideas that have crafted new trade theories based on what I believe to be true. Entering at the right time is an art, and I\'ve spoken about this so many times but:\n\nI cannot teach you how to trade. Only how to pick things to trade. The trading is the hard part - we\'re not investing -- we\'re trading. Essentially it\'s high level gambling: Knowing when to hold \'em and knowing when to fold \'em is what this game is about.\n\n**Just because a stock is listed here doesn\'t mean you blindly just enter a fucking trade on it.** Look for the entry, look for the catalysts, take advantage of sector moves or other binary events, take advantage of pullbacks or consolidation to look for a price. Set stop limits and don\'t blow your load on weeklies because there\'s very few cases where they work well (Disney anybody).\n\n**The trend is your friend.**\n\n# About Playing Earnings Events\n\nPeople ask how I normally trade earnings, are you selling? are you holding? what are you doing? etc. Here\'s my formula, it may or may not work for you but this is traditionally what I do.\n\nAny earnings events I play, I\'m normally in on the first sign of an uptrend/downtrend in the 2 week window prior to earnings OR I\'m playing by letting earnings dictate the trend, and buying after the IV crush happens.\n\n**THE TREND IS YOUR FRIEND.**\n\nRemember: The **ENTIRE** predicating factor in my plays is normally to catch higher periods of volatility at the right time, to profit not only on a move, but on the increase in Vega value of the option. Buying FD\'s the day before an earnings report is the opposite of this and while it SEEMS like it\'s your only way to make a 10-bagger happen, it couldn\'t be further from the truth.\n\nBeing in BEFORE the volatility allows me to simply liquidate a portion of the contracts for a profit, sometimes regardless of it even going slightly against the current price (average doooooown).\n\n**I recommend finding a strategy that works for you and executing it.** If you buy 0-day or front month/front week FD\'s on earnings and lose, you should NOT be surprised. I\'d say you likely are going to lose on 75%+ of those trades, moderately profit on about 90% of the remaining, and pop off on 10% of the remaining 25% (2.5% of the time). Unless you have killer DD or a reason to think the market is pricing in too low of a move, you **CANNOT BEAT THE PRICING MODEL.** For you to win, something has to be wrong, skewed, mis-priced, you must know something about the company that you think analysts/market makers are wrong on, or you have to be advantageously positioned greek wise so that regardless what happens, you win.\n\nResearch **price neutral strategies** (butterflies and calendar spreads, specifically, I hate condors but you can look those up too) if you want a way to be **SHORT VEGA** without investing as much capital. I could write fucking pages on strategies, but I won\'t, and you should learn some about them on your own and fuck them up a few times before you figure out the right places to play them.\n\n**I bolded the words you need to research.** I\'m not commenting anymore on strategy stuff here. Most people still won\'t listen to this anyway, but...\n\n**A specific example:** I bought June MSFT $145 calls at $0.04 a piece, 40 of them, and then a chunk of $135\'s throughout the last couple days of the week before earnings. My scans showed that they were mis-priced and skewed, you couldn\'t have known this, but you can easily just by using intuition find these kinds of deals. They exist, trust me. Those $145 calls are now like $0.15 I think? But they were also $0.12 right before earnings, both because of the move up, but secondarily because of the Vega pump on the options. They barely moved in value after earnings, as the crush offset a lot of the price movement. I sold half (20) the day before earnings for 200%, and basically freerolled the rest. I sold a chunk between $0.14 and $0.16 after earnings, and still have 10 of them that I will iron fist until they go to 0 or make a grand or so. The trade is already profitable, I\'ve locked that in, and I get to ride the lotto ticket on the house. I have two months to watch and decide if I really want to let them wipe themselves out or just take some more cash and move on.\n\n**Buying price directional and holding, mathematically modeled, is a losing strategy when used by itself with no other factors taken into effect.** The smart traders will see this statement for what it means, others will see it to mean that you can\'t buy directional plays. The ones that see it the first way are learning how to trade, the ones that see it the other way are the gamblers.\n\n# Results On Last Week\'s Picks\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $122.62, Closed: $129.89, High: $131.37\n\n* Win. We know all about the good news and movement, I think it still has room to go but it\'s definitely going to find consolidation near 130 and chill for even another day or two longer than it has before it continues up. Pullback to 128-127 doesn\'t concern me and I\'ll just hold all my calls regardless. Looking at the movement of it, it\'s not completely out of the question to see one after earnings. I\'d feel comfortable just bag holding my June calls until probably the middle of May, if it\'s still flat then, I feel like the cushion I\'ve built is worth the risk for more upside here. I don\'t imagine it crashing down to 115 or anything, unless the entire market comes down with it.\n\n**Verizon (VZ) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $58.14, Closed: $56.58, H: $58.49 (pointless, as it was pre-market)\n\n* Yeah so they beat or whatever but it\'s a telecom company and their guidance was meh and the results were meh. I lost 60% on this trade, and just decided I\'d rather not watch for it or navigate it anymore. Can\'t win them all.\n\n**UnitedHealth (UNH) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $224.00, Closed: $237, H: $237.11\n\n* ***I got really lucky here.*** The timing was just pure luck that it occurred the week I listed it but it popped off and rose pretty much all week. I think that it\'s probably going to continue the trend as long as there\'s volume behind it because of the reasons listed last week: The assets and forward looking potential revenue are not reflected in the stock\'s price. \n\n**Tesla (TSLA) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $269.00, Closed: $235.14, L: $231.13\n\n* **This one made me feel like a prophet.** Let\'s quote myself: "It\'s always just a matter of time before they go back to $230 because of a car blowing up or somebody saying something stupid." $230ish? Check. Tesla exploded? Check. Tesla said stupid things about leaf blowers? Check. Print print print.\n\n**Facebook (FB) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $178.25, Closed: $191.49, H: $198.48\n\n* Facebook had really stellar numbers in my opinion. Eventually, growth in USA has to stall and it did. The international numbers were fine, and the fact they\'re taking the front looking "Let\'s fight the privacy battle together" stance is great for sentiment and allows fund managers to freely continue piling into shares if they want to without their clients going SJW on them. I think the pullback is, well, whatever. People taking profit as they climb back near where they were last year, so wait for some high volume trading and an increase in price and this one still has room to make money. Sold half my calls for like 100%+ and the other half for a -2% loss because I held through the fall from grace for a day or two.\n\n**Intel (INTC) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $58.15, Closed: $52.43, H: $59.29\n\n* Buy the dip in my opinion. Not gonna say much else here but the semis are under pressure -- but I think Intel is more isolated from the general semi companies solely because they\'ll always sell chips. Some of the old 1080ti cards that Nvidia sold are still running perfect and strong and the new gen offers an increase but not as incremental as people wanted. That being said, I think Nvidia is fine but they\'re a lot more prone to slowdowns than a company like Intel. I don\'t know when they\'ll stabilize, could be days or weeks, but when they do I\'d look to profit on the move back up. China trade deal could be a big catalyst proxy play here.\n\n# The Picks for Week of April 29th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself.** Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I\'m considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.  I may or may not enter trades on these or may already be in them. The bottom of the post has the options I\'m long on, as a secondary holding disclaimer.\n\nThere was a witch hunt in the Daily Discussion thread claiming I retroactively edit my posts HAHA like I give a fuck or something... I called Twitter, I don\'t really care what anybody says. Feels good from my side, BRAH. I don\'t list every play I make, just the ones I feel like the community would be most interested in playing. I don\'t mention the premium I may be selling (but will list it if it\'s on any of the options listed) and I don\'t mention any other neutral strategies I\'m holding if they\'re not in these stocks.\n\nI typed less commentary about each stock because there\'s so many this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) - $129.89 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Trend is your friend (anybody see a theme here?). Consolidation commencing, I plan on just holding my calls. Ride the wave. Numbers are good, Azure is growing, and if somehow before June that JEDI contract gets handed out and they get it, it goes up, hard and fast just the way I like it.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Holding my calls. Maybe adding more that are 10% or so OTM but knowing full well I may lose on them because it has to move, but if it does the payoff seems pretty immense and Mickey like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oracle (ORCL) - $55.41 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* For me, Oracle is kind of a proxy play and a momentum play. \n\nThere has been a pretty nice sized volume move on Oracle as of late and some of the bigger funds are adding to their holdings. The fact that Oracle is pretty cloud-driven, besides their enterprise on-site data storage (which is very much likely moving towards cloud based offerings) and that the data sector and cloud industry is booming ($TEAM anybody? Looks like it\'s climbing right back where it was after the ridiculous earnings selloff) I think it means they have a chance to start increasing market share. As a result, as more and more people buy into this theory, the price will rise as a forward looking idea and price it in. For me, the price is $56, if it can get over that and close there, the swing play is in full effect for me. It\'s right at new 52W highs and to me (trend, friend) and with any luck, the volume will hold up and we\'ll see it plow upwards further.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Specifically, some May monthly contracts at various strikes. Pick your poison, ROI comes with more risk, so the further out, the more risk. I\'m pretty likely to just buy right ATM, and double down on some out of the money ones if it starts going for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $178.09 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* BUYYYY THEEEE DIPPPPP. \n\nI am completely ignoring any \'market sector weakness\' people are talking about in semis. It\'s cyclical, yes, and that\'s something to be cognizant of. I\'m going to wait for the price to stabilize Monday and wait and see if any binary news pops its head out, orange man says something about China, etc. and make a decision if I want to enter or keep waiting. Ideally, it will go down even more, because Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. are going to be hugeeeeee benefactors to the trade deal news. **They report 5/16 and the fact the stock really hasn\'t moved much on a 2 month rolling basis, there seems to be upside on the idea of China, in and of itself.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Calls, various strikes, might even consider weeklies here because I\'m playing it as a swing. I don\'t want to personally throw a few thousand at like 2020 calls and have to let them sit there to profit 100%. I\'d rather just take a few shots at weeklies, or front month stuff, and see if I can catch a swing and just be appropriate each day or two and close out positions that are moving towards 20-50% losses, and take a few shots at it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disney (DIS) - $139.92 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* It\'s Mickey, mother fuckers. \n\nSaw Endgame, movie was pretty badass. They\'re going to enter a string of great movies, with Lion King also coming this year. Could they sell the news Monday? Sure, but idgaf. Mickey\'s my bro and I ride or die with him. If you don\'t know the updates here with Disney+ and what not, you\'re out of the loop and you should stop trading options. Nuff said imo. **They report next week, so it\'s important to pay attention to the fact that earnings and guidance COULD disappoint versus the share price at the time, and trigger a fat pullback. It\'s all risk/reward.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Throw a dart at a list of price strikes and buy them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Electronic Arts (EA) - $94.47 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- We talked about this one a week ago? I think. Or two weeks. \n\nEither way, it started to find that bottom entry point. People keep asking if I\'m concerned about Anthem. Those that are asking that I assume are gaming enthusiasts that watch a lot of clickbait YouTube videos and pay too much attention to what some random neckbeard think about the games that come out. The company made a killing on Apex (BUT THE BATTLE PASS!!!!! OMG, same shit, just shut up because people still bought it) and the number of people that I saw buying in game currency BEFORE the battle pass is immense. \n\nThey could not have imagined that they got to the player base they did so fast and more importantly the stock did not drop because of ANY of these reasons. It dropped because of the Origin security flaw. Flaw\'s fixed. Price hasn\'t gone back up. Not priced in. **They report NEXT WEEK so if I\'m going to up my position it will be this week, not next.**\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** June or even later calls. I\'m spread from strikes currently 115-125. I might even go deeper in the chain and bet on insane action in the next month. Depends how spicy I feel and whether Taco Tuesday is any good this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ) - $71.55 -** ***BULLISH*** \\- **They report Wednesday after market.** A lot of people have heard me talk about this company. I **LOVE** Square. They have good tech and a good platform. I know that they\'re expanding their service offerings and improving on the software they acquired from Freshbooks. \n\nTheir appointments app is their bread and butter besides the payments fees, and the hardware sales help to push profits higher also. They just got me for like $600? I think or more even for a new iPad/stand setup. It just works well. This segways me to mention that if and when Stripe comes into the market as far as IPOs, be careful about being in Square or PayPal. Stripe is going to fucking crush it, they are the holy grail fintech company in my opinion.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Kind of sketch to get in now if you aren\'t, so I may just sell premium on these and then buy upside calls with the profits after earnings, but I\'m not 100% yet. I\'ll probably YOLO in on weeklies or something just because I can\'t help myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alaska Air (ALK) - $60.62 -** ***BULLISH*** *-* They just ate some price target cuts after earnings but I feel like analysts are pricing in the idea of a wide market pullback and the impacts of Boeing on the company. That being said I really like Alaska as a company and when I do fly, it\'s normally Alaska anywhere I go. Their price target cuts are still 15% or so above where the stock sits, and if the entire sector gets any type of positive news, they\'ll pop up along with Delta ($DAL) and Southwest ($LUV).\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** June or July\'s, trying to pick the strike that I feel they can reach, not surpass, and then selling a large portion of my position if they approach the price closely. In my opinion and modeling, $70.52 is the price my algorithm spit out at me. I won\'t say what goes into it, and I won\'t say what variables I set as the projection so don\'t ask, **and it means ABSOLUTELY nothing** but I just hate going against my computer because it turns into a snarky bitch when it\'s right and I\'m wrong. Either way, seems like the options aren\'t that pricy, although the spreads are kind of fucked on these. If you don\'t get a good fill on a dip at open when the bid spread crashes and rips the ask price down with it, then you probably won\'t find an advantageous position here. It\'s more lotto ticket than buying FD\'s on Square, honestly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Exxon Mobil (XOM) - $80.49 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* While the rest of the oil sector is buying itself up and combining companies into conglomerates even further, Exxon has shown some decided weakness and off their last earnings report, I\'d be willing to say we see a dip here that I\'m willing to jump on the train for. \n\nIt all depends on risk tolerance though because I\'m kind of betting against a hot market with where oil prices are at and it\'s completely possible the market 100% ignores everything that is out there on the company and is completely irrational and the price just goes up. Sure, crude pulled back but it\'s still way above where it was in recent months, so to me, that would signal that guidance for these companies could be getting sandbagged for the next round of earnings, so keep this in mind because they probably aren\'t re-working guidance based on oil pricing fluctuations but rather a range and probability model of the prices in certain economic conditions in similar years.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Another spot where I\'m willing to sling a bit at a 3-5% move on weeklies for puts because they\'re really not that expensive and people/algos will freak out over the Trump ceiling on the oil market. I\'m personally considering following up the weeklies with some that are longer expiration, at a deeper strike, and rolling my weeklies along the way until I decide I\'ve lost/made enough on the trade. Oil markets kind of a bitch sometimes and I have a slight vendetta against it for life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Occidental (OXY) - $61.31 -** ***BEARISH*** *-* I\'m going against the grain with this company because they continually are in the news and have allowed themselves to enter a bidding war with Chevron now over Anadarko. \n\nChevron will likely win this battle for the reason that I have a inkling that there\'s some options written into the deal for executives which would explain why they may take a lower priced offer for the company. If this happens, it will make Occidental appear snubbed and like a bitch, and thus, the price will go down because shareholders will lose faith in the ability of the board to get a deal done. Moreover, they\'ve raised their bid and showed they\'re willing to pay more, so Chevron could bid this way the fuck up and if the bidding war doesn\'t stop -- shareholders traditionally don\'t like a company paying way more for something just because someone bullied them into it.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** This is another play I like shorter term holdings on. I\'ll probably buy puts and hold for a day or two, and roll some profits if they win or pick a different entry. I\'d like to see lower volume on the day or timeframe I decide to enter, it would show me people aren\'t really trading it and stockholders or algo\'s could sell it off in anticipation of the entire situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify (SPOT) - $138.25 -** ***BEARISH*** \\- **They report tomorrow before market.** \n\nDon\'t take my bearish stance on Spotify to mean that I think the company is poorly run or a bad company. I think Spotify is a GREAT company but I\'ve spoken to three girls this week that exclusively use Apple Music now because it\'s \'convenient\'. Their family plan also seems to have impacted their ability to get individuals to buy accounts because I\'m sharing one with three friends, none of which live under the roof with me. Combined with the fact that Apple Music is indeed growing just as fast as they say it is, and taking market share, I think it\'s only a matter of time before Spotify tops out on growth. The stock isn\'t cheap or competitively priced anything so there has to be really positive news and guidance to go up.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** So it\'s too late to get any options for earnings on this BUT, I can easily play a swing on the report and draw a thesis, even if I\'m wrong. It\'s possible that at open, there\'s still a play to be made but I\'m definitely waiting for the IV to settle down.\n\n# State of the Market\n\nWe\'re going to get to those all time highs sooner or later. I hope it\'s sooner because a lot of plays I have are kind of betting on the short term being to the upside above those highs. I think that there\'s piles of opportunities right now, and I think we\'re going to see volatility greatly increase this week and next as May approaches. There\'s little question that the sideways action represents some type of wide-spreading accumulation and consolidation, so the question is will the people accumulating for the next move upwards on the S&amp;P be stronger than those taking profit? If so, we make all time highs and continue cruising. If not? See you in a few weeks 2,700.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it\'s more likely SPY gains that week since it\'s weighted towards them, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it\'s a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it\'s probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions. Example: Verizon on top of Apple is good - if their streaming service is good and requires iPhone hardware, the market may see a boost in iPhone sales from Verizon and ATT, etc. Corresponding plays.\n\n# Should I Hold Or Sell?\n\nFigure it out on your own. I can\'t tell you what\'s right for you nor do I care to. You have to learn to trade on your own, if this DD doesn\'t get you moving forward enough and you can\'t draw up a plan on how to trade it, then that\'s your problem and trading that stock or trading in general ***may not be for you.*** **To get better at this, play in markets you know well. Don\'t try to find the next Disney, play in stocks that move and behave somewhat rationally, and plan where you\'re entering and where you\'re exiting.**\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don\'t mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there\'s a conversation going on about it already.\n\nIf you\'ve got something you are eyeing, I\'ll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I\'ll simply ignore your comment.\n\n# Private Messages/Chat Requests\n\nI may or may not respond. Depends if the question is stupid or not.\n\n# Holdings Disclaimer\n\nOn listed plays: I am already hold various combinations of positions on Oracle (long/neutral), Microsoft (long), EA (long) and Disney (long).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I\'m going to go through and fix up typos and formatting after I eat pizza and salad and watch GoT.')], '2019-04-30': [('$GOOGL', '$GOOGL'), ('LONG $TSLA', 'LONG $TSLA'), ('$AAPL Apple Earnings Thread; Keep all discussion here', '$AAPL Apple Earnings Thread; Keep all discussion hereEPS est: $2.37\n\nEPS actual:\n\nRevenue est: $57.6B\n\nRevenue actual:'), ('Current state of the Bears’ as SPY approaches green', 'Current state of the Bears’ as SPY approaches green'), ('AAPL can burn', 'AAPL can burn'), ('From NZ so cant invest in TSLA.

Negatives for Intel include: CPU IPC has been largely stagnant for the past FOUR years. For those not familiar, IPC is Instructions Per Clock. It has nothing to do with the number of CPU cores, or the speed of a chip, and is entirely about how many instructions are executed per clock cycle. So a 2.0GHz chip with ah higher IPC will perform better than a 2.0GHz chip with a lower IPC. If the clock speeds increase, performance will go up, but newer chips with the same IPC won't be any faster when running at that 2.0GHz speed.\n\nWith Inte, 10nm being delayed itself would just mean that clock speeds won't go up, but a lack of any IPC improvements show that Intel is not improving the design of its chips well enough. So, what has Intel been doing over the past FOUR years where IPC hasn't improved? Intel finally improved the thermal interface material for better cooling of the chip itself(under the cover), so you see some speed increases, but there were already enthusiasts who were removing the lid from the chip to do this improvement themselves;, and the results has shown that the chips themselves have not really been improved, the news chips have better assembly.\n\nSo, AMD....When AMD first launched Ryzen in 2017, many people were surprised, if not shocked. Not only did AMD release 8 core chips(while Intel had stayed with 4 core chips) in the consumer space, but the new Zen core design was fairly competitive on an IPC basis as well. This allowed AMD to be every competitive with their new chips, and the only advantage that Intel had was a slight advantage in IPC, as well as high clock speeds. AMD offering double the number of cores did make Ryzen a very competitive product in most areas. Since that time, AMD boosted the IPC from first to second generation, as well as providing a bit better clock speed. Looking forward, the third generation Ryzen chips are expected in the next months (announcement and specs due on May 27th), with a 13-15% IPC improvement over second generation, and potentially a jump of 20% in clock speeds. Yes, this is a 20% boost on top of the 13-15% performance boost even at the previous speeds, so you can see how big of a jump this is expected to be, depending on clock speeds.\n\nAMD isn't stagnant in IPC, isn't stagnant in clock speeds, and may even double the core counts to 16 cores in consumer grade chips. This is why things look very promising for AMD in the second half of 2019. Intel isn't expected to have 10nm desktop chips ready before 2021 at this point, so that is why those who understand the technology see so much potential for AMD right now. AMD has at the very least, a year where it will be well ahead of Intel. Q1 and Q2 are the periods before the new chips are released, and many are waiting to buy the new chips, so a slowdown in sales SHOULD be expected.\n\n***TLDR - SU BAE WILL GIVE US THE GOODS IN THE SECOND HALF***\n\n**SHORT TERM** 5/3 $29/28.5P  \n**LONG TERM** 11/15 $28C"), ('TSLA to $4,000.

I kind of think it will try for 200 again.... but there's a good possibility that will trade sideways in a channel: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZwVmnA5b/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZwVmnA5b/) .     I was right about it mooning yesterday (Friday): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk04nw/what\\_are\\_your\\_moves\\_tomorrow\\_may\\_03/emdb449?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk04nw/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_may_03/emdb449?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) .   To get back into calls, see if MCD dips to 196.## on Monday and then get into 5/31 202.50calls for less than 1.00. If you followed my play, those 202.50c 5/31's went from 0.55 to 1.00, so almost doubled yesterday. Anyway, keep an eye on MCD and BTFD.... if there's even a dip from now to 200. :( \n2. IWM: in this bull market IWM was destined to break 160 (like I said last week; see link above). It closed above 160 on Friday at 160.53. Last year, on 5/17/2018, IWM finally broke 160, and then flew to 163. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/N4eMRFvD/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/N4eMRFvD/) I think there is a very high probability that IWM is going to 163 very soon, possibly by Friday. If ETSY beats on Wednesday (and ETSY is the largest holding in IWM, btw), IWM will likely go to 163 on Thursday. Once it hits 163, it will likely cool off and consolidate back to 161.## before it makes its next leg up to 164.38ish. After that the next key resistance level is 166.69: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/pbOtleNn/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pbOtleNn/) This is based off of 2018, the only other time IWM has been in 160+ territory. I think these resistance numbers will work again, since the ALGO's bots will trade off of the 2018 data anyways. **The play: on whatever dip Monday provides, 5/25 165c for ideally slightly less than 0.60, but 0.60 would be a fine price. Could put a limit order in for 0.59 and see if it gets filled on Monday (but it may not), esp. if we open with a gap up on Monday.**                    IWM is looking SUPER bullish to me! Look at this YUGE fucking daily candle breaking out of upper BB band: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/zmCmUN3N/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zmCmUN3N/) Solid volume. This thing is gonna fly, imo. \n3. SPY 5/17 300c for ideally 0.30. I plan on picking up 10 of these and will sell when SPY hits 296ish. \n4. NVDA: I am convinced that NVDA will find it's way back to 191 by ER, which is on 5/16. I might be wrong, of course. Last ER, NVDA wanted to get to 160 no matter what before ER and it did. NVDA is probably manipulated, which is fine with me. It is my theory that on 5/16, the IV will boost to 150%+, which has been the case for the past three ER's (I don't know what it's done before that because I wasn't trading before that). If i'm right, the 5/17calls right now are pricing in the IV at 50%. Now even if it doesn't get to 150% (which it will), there's no way it will stay at 50%; that's for sure. NVDA is at 183 right now. **The play: 5/17 200c for 1.75-1.80ish (currently pricing in 50% IV, which is just silly).** I have a theory that if two conditions are met by 5/16, this play will be profitable: (1) NVDA does reach at least 191 by 5/16 (super possible; it may go even higher, to 193), and (2) the IV does go to 150%+ like it should. If these two conditions are met, THETA will be defeated/muted. I picked one up on Friday. I plan to pick up one more on Monday. If my prediction's right, I think these 200c contracts will be around $4.00. That's a 100%. Let's see. (I think it's worth looking into these things and experimenting a bit if one plans to trade long term, imo). \n5. SQ. Looks like it established a bottom to me (maybe others who know TA better than me can comment?): 4hour: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/EJD9Kok0/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/EJD9Kok0/) Daily: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/6WDb6q91](https://www.tradingview.com/x/6WDb6q91/) .  Looks like SQ is in a following wedge, but has established a bottom with those LONG bottom candle sicks, confirmed by a Green candle with long bottom stick. This indicated, to my understanding, seller exhaustion. Here's an interesting play, inspired by this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk8vho/made\\_it\\_out\\_of\\_msft\\_alive/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk8vho/made_it_out_of_msft_alive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) .   **The Play (1k profit, theta gang style):**  **Sell 67.50put and buy 67put, for credit of $16. Open 63 of these credit bull put spreads for $1008.** To keep the full $1k profit, SQ just has to close above 67.50 on Friday. I think this is quite likely, especially if this is going to be bullish week, which it's looking like to me. There is great loss protection, since the long put is so close in price to the short put. Theta should burn on this FD credit spread. SQ just has to hold 67.50 for five trading days. Open this spread on an SQ dip, for a higher credit, and then open however many (my goal is 1k credit profit). **Collateral is needed for this play: for 63 contracts, $3150 collateral is required.** That's not bad for possibility of making 1k. Of course, you can close these spreads anytime. Let's say SQ wants to test 70 this week, at least once, before getting rejected hard (i think this is quite possible), then close everything for a profit and release your collateral (i don't know how much profit this would yield).\n\n**ER PLAYS** [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk7041/most\\_anticipated\\_earnings\\_releases\\_for\\_the\\_week/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk7041/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/)\n\n1.

Picks are generated from that scan. Those scans are ran through scripts that check certain volatility skews and other metrics based on volume and volatility ratios. These are my own scripts, and nah, you can\'t have them. The indicative theory here is sell IV when it\'s high and buy IV when it\'s low (for the most part) follow trends and follow the big money (I rarely list my credit spread plays, because I don\'t want someone to blow their retirement out of the water based on my advice). Volatility is literally the most important aspect in options pricing and finding positive EV situations. A few of the criteria for the ToS scans are:\n\n* Market cap of $5B+\n* Daily volume of 1M+\n* Volume, volume differential, RSI, 52 week low\'s and high\'s, ToS sizzle, and a few others decide what comes out of the scan, then selected as a pick based on script results/current market conditions/sentiment.\n\n# My Project Update\n\nIf you want to stay up to date on the things I\'m working on outside of here, follow me on my Reddit profile and feel free to message me. I\'m doing multiple things, including making a blog to post expanded commentary on certain market events, and some free training content on nuance type things (analyzing stocks, backtesting, etc).

I have a couple other things in the pipeline, so if you want to know more about them, as I said you can follow me on here.\n\n# Results On Last Week\'s Picks\n\nIf you blindly bought in on Monday, most the picks were extremely profitable come Wednesday, I think all but one. However, JPow released his infinity gauntlet ([https://imgur.com/RY2XdtS](https://imgur.com/RY2XdtS)), and we all took the dick Wednesday and Thursday, I\'m sure. Well, all of us except those that had cheap credit spreads to buy back and close.\n\nWednesday and Thursday can be discredited for almost all last week\'s daily price action because the entire broad market was down, regardless what you were playing. Friday was an awesome recovery and shows that we aren\'t just in a massive bubble, depending what happens Monday with Trump\'s fiasco today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Microsoft (MSFT) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $129.93, Closed: $128.89, High: $131.23\n\n* "Consolidation commencing" - I ended up cashing out my calls mid week. I lost my heart to hold my $135s mid week on Wednesday, and cashed them out at super solid 175% or so. I\'ve had them since like a week before earnings, so it was about time to move on. We saw a lot of back/fill action and consolidation until JPow unleashed the bears, however it had a pretty massive day on Friday. There were definitely points to get in on this mid week last week and if you bought the dip, you could have had a good week on it and might have a good one this week, even with the Trump shit coming to light tonight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Oracle (ORCL) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $55.29, Closed: $54.78, High: $55.50\n\n* "For me, Oracle is kind of a proxy play and a momentum play." - And it still is. I think we\'re seeing a lot of consolidation here still and people are pretty likely to buy any impending dip on it with Monday\'s market. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nvidia (NVDA) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $178.39, Closed: $183.00, High: $184.87\n\n* "BUYYYY THEEEE DIPPPPP." - Not much to say here. It traded strong all week on the prior week\'s semi sector weakness and I think it did so appropriately. Earnings are coming up, so you may see quite a bit of people buying this stock up pre-earnings on the thesis that AMD beat earnings, so it\'s likely Nvidia will also (not to mention, EVERY COMPANY IS BEATING this earnings seasons because of the sandbagged guidance previously).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disney (DIS) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $142.19 (after hours rise), Closed: $134.28, High: $143.05 (pre-market monday)\n\n* "It\'s Mickey, mother fuckers." - Yknow... this one pissed me off a bit. I had a chance to get out of my very profitable calls Monday after the initial dip, and did not do that. I sold Tuesday a bit after open and just decided to watch. That being said, we\'re back around where we were after the Disney+ announcement, and if it goes any lower, I\'m very tempted to buy back into calls or even sell puts against earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Electronic Arts (EA) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $94.89, Closed: $92.50 High: $97.20\n\n* "Buy the dip?" - So there\'s a lot to be said here. It\'s a perfect example of a good trader wins and a greedy one eats the dick. There was definitely a point on Monday AND Tuesday to enter, and a clear point on Wednesday to exit if your greed didn\'t get to you. You got another chance on Thursday morning, even. The way I look at this company has not changed whatsoever: They have been so heavily beat down for the last few quarters, and lost such a huge amount of their stock\'s value that the upside is much more likely than the downside. It\'s kind of like a game of limbo right now, but I\'m not sure they can clear under another bar. We saw clear buying action off the $90ish lows before last week, and plenty of buying action even on Wednesday. The way I look at it is that most the bad news is priced into this stock, and none of the good news. Company valuation is improving, fundamentals in general, are improving, so they\'d have to have a god awful earnings report to do any worse than they already are, and I just don\'t see that happening. They still hold some of the most popular sports franchises, which cannot be discredited, either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Square (SQ) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $71.54, Closed: $68.52 High: $74.73\n\n* "I **LOVE** Square" - And nothing has changed, either. As far as the trade, if you held through earnings, that\'s the risk we take, right? There was obvious places to profit here. Their payments processed number was disappointing in the quarterly report, but I think with this stock we\'re playing the long game. The earnings report made it all seem a lot worse than it was, and they bottomed out at $66 at one point last week. This is similar to what happened to $TEAM a few weeks ago, and Atlassian is almost back where they were pre-earnings. Same thing is likely happening here as far as a mean reversion goes. I think the company is strong, they fill an important and needed niche, but Dorsey needs to focus a lot more on expanded market penetration than his bullshit Cash App. Long term, the app has potential to get them into the peer to peer space a bit more, but I think his initial vision was probably as people using it like Apple Pay, and that, I just don\'t see happening. All of that being said, they don\'t have any real threat in the space (PayPal\'s card reader experiment was anything but successful) and they hold a special spot, doing a special thing for small and medium sized businesses (even some larger ones). They will likely focus on expanding service revenues, and I still am bullish on Square. It\'s a good spot to average down/buy in because in my opinion it\'s going back over $70 in short time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alaska Air (ALK) -** ***BULLISH*** \\- Opened week: $60.30, Closed: $62.47, High: $63.26\n\n* "I always fly Alaska" - And still will. The stock showed some great strength throughout all of the mid week bullshit, was mostly unaffected, and if you bought any time Monday, you\'re green and probably staying green, I went to almost all cash on Friday afternoon in my options account so -- this is one of the last ones I have, will likely liquidate Monday morning at some point, but may go back in if they clear/hold over $63. Not much else to analyze here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Exxon Mobil (XOM) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $80.12, Closed: $77.47, Low: $77.24\n\n* "Exxon has shown some decided weakness" - Now, the entire oil sector kind of pulled back a bit, but we\'re in a backing/filling period with it and I expect the sector to rebound sometime soon. It may not be this week but it\'s hard for me to stay bearish much below $75 or so in the short term. Played out as expected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Occidental (OXY) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $60.00, Closed: $57.95, Low: $56.95\n\n* "Bidding war with Chevron now over Anadarko" - The Buffett news helped them out a bit, and Icahn building a position is interesting also. That being said, I\'m probably ready to be out of this. My main thesis was in general, they had introduced a level of uncertainty that was too much on the speculative news over the deal and that they would likely retract since the deal is anything but done, and they did. Now -- if they don\'t get the deal with Anadarko -- we could see it really pull back further, as stockholder sentiment will likely fall hard if they can\'t get a deal done with Buffett literally throwing cash at them. I\'m also leaning bullish on the oil sector after last week, so it\'s hard to stay bearish here for consistencies sake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Spotify (SPOT) -** ***BEARISH*** \\- Opened week: $144.40, Closed: $136.16, Low: $131.86\n\n* "The stock isn\'t cheap or competitively priced" - Buying action reinforced that thought (or selling action, in this case). Even if you weren\'t in before earnings, there was a chance to get in on puts and make a good profit by Thursday\'s dip. That first candle on Monday morning should have been enough indication that it was going lower, too. \n\n# State of the Market\n\nBull and bear in a China shop right now - literally. It\'s just a lot to take in from a lot of angles. \n\nThe dip off the Fed announcing they weren\'t doing anything was disappointing (obviously a cut was priced in at that point, solely based off price action, so no question about that now) but now we look for other catalysts to continue higher. The China trade deal is a big one but it seems that Trump is completely off his rocker and going full Elon on Twitter. The way I look at it is that a pullback is more imminent (could be one or two days, or could be a full week, or we can go full December, who knows) but the stabilization on Thursday and the buying action on Friday is a really good sign. It means that at least enough investors didn\'t really care about what the Fed said and decided at the prices equities are at, it was still worth buying things back up. If the market really disintegrates this week on Monday because of what Trump has said, I\'m likely not trading a whole lot until the market shows its colors on Wednesday.\n\nWhat I\'m trying to get at is that you need to be fluid with your strategies. \n\nSome of the ones I had written down for this week like Google calls, Nvidia calls, selling put spreads on Amazon, selling put spreads on Apple, are all probably up in smoke over one tweet on a Sunday. My Alibaba catch up trade is also probably up in fucking smoke after what he said as I was about to buy FD calls on it.\n\nI have them in my playbook still, but I may just hold onto them until an opportunity presents itself at some point whether it\'s this week or not. Now that earnings are behind us for a lot of companies, you can draw a thesis on a company based on their guidance and post earnings performance. Now is the time to be playing longer dated calls in single leg strategies, and now is the time to be formulating what shares you want to own in a wider portfolio because you know what sectors are poised to outperform, and what headwinds face other sectors. \n\nSo we\'re shifting gears to include two sector based strategies this week, as an example of how to be fluid. Let\'s be clear... until the market shows some type of bottom or stabilization Monday(Tues/Wed)? on decent volume: I\'m sitting out. You do what you want.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The Picks for Week of May 6th, 2019\n\n**All of the commentary on specific tickers are simply notes I wrote to myself.** Each ticker listed is not a suggestion to buy or sell, but simply the ones I took notes on that I\'m considering entering. These notes are not to you personally. These are not complete transcriptions -- simply summaries of my thoughts. Do your own DD.  I may or may not enter trades on these or may already be in them. The bottom of the post has the options I\'m long on, as a secondary holding disclaimer.\n\nBecause I get shit for going with market trends, I\'m going to try to pick things tat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nvidia (NVDA) - $183.01** ***- BULLISH***\n\nThey report on 5/16. So... after AMD\'s actually very solid earnings report, and them subsequently not holding their gains, I posted in the daily discussion that I was about to go balls deep in AMD calls. Well, I did. I bought a fuckton of cheap lottos at $28.50 strike and they all... expired worthless because I fell asleep mid morning Thursday and held too long. Too bad, so sad. That being said -- I think AMD\'s successful earnings report creates an opportunity to get bullish on Nvidia again.\n\nI think Nvidia is in general, a better company than AMD, and AMD has to compete with both Intel and Nvidia, while Nvidia is only competing with one. Intel\'s shitty quarter may speak a lot to why AMD\'s was so good, but I think that overall, the huge uptick in Fortnite, Apex, etc. means graphic card sales probably closed some of the gap down from when the crypto bubble burst.\n\nThey are **VERY EXPOSED** to the China trade talks however. If the sector shows some real weakness, I plan to wait until it\'s done and find a GOOD ENTRY POINT HERE. I think the stock at some point is heading back north of $210, so it\'s all about being a magician with your entry point and being patient.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** June/July north of 200 calls, or if shorter dated, ATM once the market stabilizes this week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Amazon (AMZN) - $1,962.46** ***- BULLISH***\n\nBecause it\'s an easy pick and it\'s Amazon... right? BERKSHIRE DID IT WHY CAN\'T I?! That being said... yeah there\'s a ton of momentum behind this move. Once again, the market is probably going to be shit on Monday morning, so there\'s a chance to play a catch up here after missing the move on Friday.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** I saw a lot of cool gains on Friday morning on that pop -- but we likely are not getting a 3% day in this again overnight. I\'m looking at slightly OTM calls, short expiration, mid May, trying to find a dip to buy on and wait for a rise on solid volume. I\'m also going to try to replicate what some people did in the thread, and buy FD\'s on Thursday (because I cannot help myself) before close if the stock is down at all and Trump hasn\'t burned the entire market to the ground.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Financials ETF (XLF) - $28.06** ***- BULLISH*** \n\nThe banks have shown all kinds of strength in the last few months if you check the trend on this ETF. They\'ve held above the $27 point which is really important, and I think we can see that continue for longer if the markets don\'t deteriorate into a complete pullback.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** May 17 calls, Jun 21 lottos. Likely playing the May\'s for the swing and not looking to take them too far into profit, and let the June\'s ride if the May\'s work out. If the May\'s do not work out, I will adjust my strikes for the Junes, average down if I can, and go back in on Junes, and watch/adjust as needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alaska Air (ALK) - $62.48 -** ***BULLISH***\n\nLike I said in my recap, this stock showed immense strength through the rest of the market selling off. It\'s also on a good uptrend, has broken the $62 range which was really important point of resistance, and could be on it\'s way back to $70+. I like it still this week.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Only monthlies here, so front month ATM/1 strike inside, longer dated 3% OTM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Alibaba (BABA) - $195.21** ***- BEARISH***\n\nThis could be the pick that makes me look pretty fucking stupid, but I just cannot see how they can hold the last week or two worth of gains with how the trade talks are going. They\'re super exposed and some of these gains had to be the pricing in of a successful trade deal. Once the trade talk bullshit stabilizes (if it does) it\'s likely just going north again, so this has to be a short term play.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** Front week ATM puts, monthlies somewhere between $190 and $185. Considering selling call spreads near the money on short term expirations, or even one or two strikes inside as the risk rewards pretty good if we can get a fat dip. I\'ll just eat max loss and pay to close them out if they don\'t work out rather than end up short shares.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**USA Oil ETF (USO) - $12.86** ***-*** ***BULLISH***\n\nSo the oil sector, as a WHOLE has shown a bit of strength over the last few months. While we\'re in the midst of a pullback, I think this is one to be watched. I may/probably won\'t trade it this week, but if we can see some positive action in the price of oil this week -- it\'s worth jumping on board. There\'s a decidedly obvious pullback at the EXACT moment in it all, but I think after a really good run this year without any hesitation, it was coming.\n\n* **Plays I\'m Looking At -** FD\'s if they\'re still cheap Monday at $13, or $13.50 lottos at $2 a pop. June/July around the same strike, and $14\'s seem appealing even in June. Will be waiting on ALL these plays if the sector shows weakness Monday morning/afternoon, and pending any real news in the oil sector. If the pullback continues, just waiting and adjusting strikes appropriately until I feel comfortable entering and know I will average down if I\'m wrong on timing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What Strike(s) Are You Looking At?\n\nI used to list these in detail, but I don\'t put as much detail into these now for multiple reasons. I\'ve tried to slowly add more detail to help people see how I think about the trade in general, but YMMV. You should pick your own strikes, because I could very well be wrong. \n\nThe majority of the time, if I\'m playing anything near week or near month, it\'s going to be ATM or VERY slightly OTM. Sometimes I get the FD itch, like everybody else. I will regularly throw $100 or some shit at some SPY/QQQ lottos during strength or in volatile environments. In more stable environments, I\'m less likely to do this. \n\nIf I\'m holding two or three months out I\'m likely buying further OTM as I feel more comfortable accepting a 100% capital risk as the capital invested is normally lower and I\'m much more speculative but have more upside. I\'m also willing to average down on these positions heavily on down days. \n\nIf I\'m selling credit spreads or cash secured puts, it all depends. If I\'m truly heavily bearish, I\'m selling at the money shit and watching it depreciate quickly on a near week expiry. If I\'m just sure it\'s in a consolidation period, I\'m a bit OTM. If I\'m really feeling like gambling, I might even sell ITM credit spreads on either side (calls if I\'m bearish, puts if I\'m bullish) and try to capture both Vega and intrinsic. \n\nIf it\'s earnings, it all depends on my outlook on the company, it\'s current price levels/volume, and other economic/market factors, as well as sector influences. I can be very bullish short term but bearish past this month based on uncertainty, because uncertainty rules all.\n\n# Can I Just Blindly Follow You And Win?\n\nNope, that\'s why it\'s called trading. In fact, you probably can\'t trade on the long side for more than 20% or so of your total plays and win in the long term (2-5 years). Six months, or one year, or whatever is not the type of trading volume to even form a real decision on a trend. Even a few thousand trades isn\'t really enough, and you may be working in a certain market environment where a strategy works, until it does not anymore.\n\nI cannot teach you how to trade. Only how to pick things to trade. The trading is the hard part - we\'re not investing -- we\'re trading. Essentially it\'s high level gambling: Knowing when to hold \'em and knowing when to fold \'em is what this game is about.\n\n**Just because a stock is listed here doesn\'t mean you blindly just enter a fucking trade on it.** Look for the entry, look for the catalysts, market news, sector strength/weakness, uncertainties, take advantage of sector moves up or other binary events, take advantage of pullbacks or consolidation to look for a price.\n\n**The trend is your friend.**\n\nEntries, exits, risk allowance on your portfolio, diversification of strategies, adjusting trades, legging in and out of positions, and many other tactics will decide your success. Starting with long calls or puts, or more desirably debit spreads (to limit capital exposure), are a good way to get a feel for how prices fluctuate. That will allow you to deduce more complicated strategies and decide what type of options trader you want to be. **There\'s multiple ways to profit off the same exact underlying,** at some points there will be longs AND shorts that profit at the end of the week.\n\n**READ THIS:** The majority of people who win in the market are net sellers. That doesn\'t mean that there\'s never a situation where a single leg call or put is a good/okay idea. Somewhere between 50-90% of my activities with options at any given time is spent SELLING PREMIUM. I will **never** list a stock as Bullish that I have credit spreads open on or that I\'m selling premium on. \n\nNo more than 15% of my entire portfolio is in options at any time which is still incredibly high for the average person, but with the technological advantage and automation at my fingertips, I\'m okay with having that level of risk. I also used to play poker semi-professionally, so I\'m not risk averse, in any way shape or form.\n\nTake this for what it is.\n\n# About Correlated/Corresponding Picks\n\nCorrelated picks are important. An example is playing Apple/Facebook/Microsoft and SPY. If any of those gain, it\'s more likely SPY gains that week since it\'s weighted towards them and the sector is likely doing well, and the S&amp;P is weighted towards them. Calls in both double dips, but can see your money evaporate also. Buying tech sector puts and SPY calls makes no sense, for the exact same rationale unless it\'s a pure hedge against share value, or an isolated catalyst like a lawsuit or acquisition, in which case, it\'s probably going to pull the ETF/index down or up with it anyway. The best way to double dip is to find complimentary positions.\n\n# Should I Hold Or Sell?\n\nFigure it out on your own. I can\'t tell you what\'s right for you nor do I care to. You have to learn to trade on your own, if this DD doesn\'t get you moving forward enough and you can\'t draw up a plan on how to trade it, then that\'s your problem and trading that stock or trading in general ***may not be for you.*** **To get better at this, play in markets you know well.** Play in stocks that move and behave somewhat rationally with sector news and are CURRENTLY in a correlated state (market goes up, stock goes up, and vice versa), and plan where you\'re entering and where you\'re exiting.\n\n# Will You Cover This Ticker/Give Me Your Thoughts On This?\n\n**Post coverage requests in this post. Not to my private messages.**\n\n**BEFORE YOU ASK FOR A TICKER:** Lots of people ask for the same thing, I don\'t mind adding color commentary on specifics if you have a question about a certain aspect of the company, but please just load all the comments and CTRL+F (CMD+F for Mac) and look for that ticker to see if there\'s a conversation going on about it already.\n\nIf you\'ve got something you are eyeing, I\'ll occasionally be willing to offer my thoughts on the company and the underlying. **I can not, and will not tell you when to enter/exit/buy/sell any stock or option,** however. I will simply say what I think about the specific ticker and their outlook. Once again, it is simply **my opinion and not advice.** **If you ask for a ticker overview, include the ticker symbol with a $, like $AAPL,** so I can just search the thread for them. If you ask me specifically for advice on your own position, or situation, I\'ll simply ignore your comment.\n\n# Private Messages/Chat Requests\n\nI may or may not respond. Depends if the question is worth answering or if you just glazed over the post. I won\'t answer private messages about specific stocks. **Post coverage requests in this post.** Strategy based things, more likely.\n\n# Holdings Disclaimer\n\nOn listed plays: I am long Alaska Air options.

Now a new Intel chip vulnerability nicknamed “ZombieLoad” has been\xa0revealed to the public, and though it’s already being patched by three major operating system makers, there’s some bad news: full protection could reduce your CPU’s performance by up to 40%.\nIn a just-published\xa0support document,\xa0Apple suggests that full ZombieLoad mitigation will require Intel chip users to disable Intel’s hyper-threading processing feature — a major selling point of the chipmaker’s CPUs. During testing this month, Apple says that it found “as much as a 40 percent reduction in performance with tests that include multithreaded workloads and public benchmarks,” though actual performance impacts will vary between machines.\nGoogle and Microsoft (via\xa0TechCrunch) have also started the process of patching their Intel-based operating systems. In\xa0Google’s case, Chrome OS devices have already received some protections and will receive more in the next OS release; Intel-only Android devices are rare, but will receive OS patches once device makers deploy them. Microsoft is releasing\xa0patches\xa0for Windows today, and has already protected Azure users. Some microcode processor updates will come from Microsoft directly, and others from device makers.\nThe ZombieLoad issue was apparently disclosed to Intel one month ago, and impacts all Intel processors produced since 2011. Chips from AMD and ARM are not believed to be susceptible to this flaw. According to vendors, there are no known real-world exploits of the vulnerability at this point, though the researchers simply say that they don’t know if it’s been abused in the wild.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/venturebeat.com/2019/05/14/intel-zombieload-flaw-forces-os-patches-with-up-to-40-performance-hits/amp/'), ('Some good DD regarding INTC security flaw.

The performance impact alone can, according to Intel, be as high as 9%, and this leaps up to nearly 50% if you also (as many recommend) turn off hyperthreading. The article is long, but well worth a read. I\'ve bolded the following two excerpts from the full text:\n\n**According to the VU, Intel tried to downplay the severity of the leak by officially paying $40,000 in reward and "$80,000" in addition. That offer was politely refused.**\n\n**"If it were up to Intel, they would have wanted to wait another six months"**\n\nSource here: [https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/05/14/hackers-mikken-op-het-intel-hart-a3960208](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/05/14/hackers-mikken-op-het-intel-hart-a3960208)\n\nTranslation from Dutch to English:\n\n# VU discovers megaleak in Intel chips\n\nThanks to a mistake, the VU uncovered a mega breach in Intel chips. Intel pays the price for a fast but risky design.\n\nThe news in brief:\n\n* **Researchers from the VU University Amsterdam have found an extensive data breach that is present in all Intel processors. These chips are in more than 80 percent of all computers and servers.**\n* **On Tuesday evening, Intel and VU announced the details of RIDL (Rogue In-Flight Data Load), a vulnerability that allows malicious parties to "steal almost all data" from computers. Unauthorized persons can view the data that the processor is currently processing.**\n* **The vulnerability is in all Intel processors of the last ten years - including the very latest. Hackers can exploit the vulnerability by hiding code in a web advertisement.**\n\nTwo rack cabinets from the Ikea full of computer walls, a jumble of cables and a stack of second-hand processors. It is not immediately the test lab that you expect from which VU University researchers uncovered the sophisticated, super-complex leak in recent months.\n\nHere, in room P455, on the fourth floor of the W&amp;N building in Amsterdam, it was demonstrated that all Intel processors of the past ten years are susceptible to a major leak. This means that more than 80 percent of all computers in the world are susceptible to an attack that gives access to data at the heart of the computer.\n\nRIDL, as the new vulnerability was baptized, came to light by chance. On Tuesday 11 September, Stephan van Schaijk, Computer Science student at VU University Amsterdam, worked on his study assignment: investigating a leak in the Intel processor.\n\nVan Schaijk: „I was busy for an hour but did not advance. I adjusted something in my code and then I saw something strange appear on the screen. Values \u200b\u200bI did not expect. "\n\nVan Schaijk had made a mistake, a bug in a bug, with which he could suddenly watch what happened in another program. It was a bigger and more serious leak than he was actually looking for.\n\nHis colleagues and teachers were just as surprised. Together, they wrote more than 20 "exploits" attack scenarios in a short time that would allow hackers to take control of the computer.\n\nOne of those tricks: by logging in with an incorrect password, the attacker forces the computer to compare the wrong password with the correct password. This data runs through the \'pipelines\' of the chip and can be intercepted, after which the hacker can retrieve the correct password after some tinkering. "You find fragments. As if you are going to get a paper document through the shredder and then reassemble the shreds, ”says Herbert Bos, professor of system and network security at the VU.\n\nStephan van Schaijk was sent out to buy as many different processors as possible, to see if they were all vulnerable.\n\nAnd that was true. Even the oldest one, from 2008, that was picked up via Marktplaats, turned out to be vulnerable to RIDL, or Rogue In-Flight Data Load. And so, Intel was immediately warned.\n\nA beer please\n\nIt is not the first time that Intel gets into trouble with a leak in its processors. The chip is extra fast because it is ahead of things: each time the processor speculates which data is probably needed next. This presents risks because computer processes do not remain well separated from each other.\n\nAssistant professor Kaveh Razavi compares it to a café: the processor works like a waitress who assumes that you want to drink the same as the one before you. The glass is poured automatically without the waitress checking whether you can have that beer.\n\nThe solution: the tray must be emptied after every order. That makes the processor slower. Depending on the programs you use, the speed difference can be considerable, the researchers expect. That explains why Intel has been struggling so long to fix this leak.\n\nRIDL cuts right through all existing security layers. This applies to the data centers where virtual systems often run on the same server. The encrypted environment that Intel devised for business customers is also vulnerable.\n\nPremium with aftertaste\n\nAlthough parts of the leak were found by several researchers from different universities and companies, the VU has discovered the majority. Amsterdam University is also the only party to receive a reward: $100,000 (89,000 euros), Intel\'s maximum reward for discoverers of critical leaks.\n\nThere is a small taste to the premium. **According to the VU, Intel tried to downplay the severity of the leak by officially paying $40,000 in reward and "$80,000" in addition. That offer was politely refused.**\n\nAnyone who accepts a reward must also adhere to the rules. In this case, that meant: no consultation between researchers and uncertainty about which software manufacturers were warned in advance. According to the researchers, tech companies do not reason in the interests of the user, but of the shareholder.\n\nIntel initially failed to notify Google and Mozilla, two major browser manufacturers.\n\nThe VU tried to force the manufacturer to come out faster. Eventually the VU forced Intel to come out in May - otherwise the university would publish the details itself. "**If it were up to Intel, they would have wanted to wait another six months**," says Bos.\n\nIntel had promised that the next generation of chips would not be vulnerable to RIDL, but that is not the case.\n\nHackers usually anticipate software vulnerabilities. Undiscovered holes (zero days) in important programs are sold for a lot of money in the black circuit. But after Specter and Meltdown, two fundamental holes that were previously found in Intel chips, both the ethical computer experts and the criminal figures are pointing their hardware. "Processors have become so complex that chip makers no longer have security under control," said Bos.\n\nAnd what should you do as a computer user? Update, update and update again. It is expected that all major software manufacturers will close the gap or have already closed the latest releases. It\'s not for nothing that RIDL comes out on Patch Tuesday, the monthly update day from Microsoft.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/boyhwo/intel\\_tried\\_to\\_bribe\\_vu\\_university\\_amsterdam\\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/boyhwo/intel_tried_to_bribe_vu_university_amsterdam_into/)'), ('5/15 SPY 300C: Goodnight, sweet prince.', '5/15 SPY 300C: Goodnight, sweet prince.We are gathered here today to mourn the loss of 5/15 SPY 300 calls.

Now a new Intel chip vulnerability nicknamed “ZombieLoad” has been\xa0revealed to the public, and though it’s already being patched by three major operating system makers, there’s some bad news: full protection could reduce your CPU’s performance by up to 40%.\nIn a just-published\xa0support document,\xa0Apple suggests that full ZombieLoad mitigation will require Intel chip users to disable Intel’s hyper-threading processing feature — a major selling point of the chipmaker’s CPUs. During testing this month, Apple says that it found “as much as a 40 percent reduction in performance with tests that include multithreaded workloads and public benchmarks,” though actual performance impacts will vary between machines.\nGoogle and Microsoft (via\xa0TechCrunch) have also started the process of patching their Intel-based operating systems. In\xa0Google’s case, Chrome OS devices have already received some protections and will receive more in the next OS release; Intel-only Android devices are rare, but will receive OS patches once device makers deploy them. Microsoft is releasing\xa0patches\xa0for Windows today, and has already protected Azure users. Some microcode processor updates will come from Microsoft directly, and others from device makers.\nThe ZombieLoad issue was apparently disclosed to Intel one month ago, and impacts all Intel processors produced since 2011. Chips from AMD and ARM are not believed to be susceptible to this flaw. According to vendors, there are no known real-world exploits of the vulnerability at this point, though the researchers simply say that they don’t know if it’s been abused in the wild.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/venturebeat.com/2019/05/14/intel-zombieload-flaw-forces-os-patches-with-up-to-40-performance-hits/amp/'), ('$INTC with a massive new hardware exploit. buy $AMD?', '$INTC with a massive new hardware exploit. buy $AMD?')], '2019-05-16': [('Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE) to collaborate on new cloud based solutions for gaming experiences and solutions, and also explore collaboration in areas of semiconductors and AI', 'Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE) to collaborate on new cloud based solutions for gaming experiences and solutions, and also explore collaboration in areas of semiconductors and AI'), ('NVDA earnings, thoughts?', 'NVDA earnings, thoughts?'), ('PROTIP: Selling OTM June 2021 SPY puts is free money', 'PROTIP: Selling OTM June 2021 SPY puts is free money$130 trading for $1/contract.

The general idea is that the statements and actions of federal legislators can have an effect on broader markets. I try to provide interesting happenings as well as participants. I don't suggest any specific positions: I'd like those to come from consensus in the discussion. Thus, this is flagged as Discussion rather than DD.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n- All of this is subject to change at any time (i.e. votes can be delayed, hearings can be canceled, witnesses can be struck). The House and Senate operate under their own rules, and those rules are entirely enforced by the chambers themselves.\n- The House is controlled by Democrats, and the Senate is controlled by Republicans. So if a hearing is happening in the House, it is somewhat safe to assume that it reflect a relatively liberal position. However, the committees have representation by both parties, so the discussion won't be entirely one-sided.\n- In general, recorded votes on the ``floor'' of either chamber are taken the most seriously, followed by votes (or hearings) taken by the full committee, followed by votes (or hearings) by a subcommittee.\n- The Senate is generally taken more seriously than the House, since it moves slower and is less likely to produce legislation. Thus, the legislation it does produce is exceptionally important. A corollary, though, is that the Senate has much less activity in any given week (only 100 members, but the same workload [plus appointments] as the 435-member House).\n- The floor schedule of either chamber is notoriously hard to predict more than a day or two in advance, as it is structured almost entirely by party leadership and can change on the whims of that leadership. Hearings, however, are relatively more stable and scheduled. (In other words, the hearings are much more certain to happen, while the votes can be added or subtracted with much less certainty.)\n- This is not all activity, just activity most likely to be relevant to financial markets. There is also no guarantee this activity has an effect on any individual stock or market. I'm not an expert, and this is not advice. It is the beginning of a discussion.\n\n***\n\nResults from last week:\n\n- UNH dropped as low as $232 from over $240 last Friday, after the passage of HR 987 (lowering drug prices)\n- GILD dropped almost immediately on Friday morning after posting the Congressional discussion, and it extended that decline through Monday (along with the broader market, to be fair)\n- BA recordings were leaked on Wednesday night, which just happened to be the day before the FAA hearing\n- XLF had a broadly down week, despite the market pickup\n- NRG and OXY both had awful days on Thursday, suggesting truth to the adage that it's almost universally bad to appear before Congress\n\n***\n\nShared activity (across both chambers):\n\nThe House is also like to take vote on HR 1994, a bill to encourage retirement savings (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr1994ih/pdf/BILLS-116hr1994ih.pdf). This is paired with an as yet unnumbered Senate bill to do the same (https://www.portman.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/Retirement%20Security%20%26%20Savings%20Act%20-%202019%20final_0.pdf), which is important because it's bipartisan (introduced with Chuck Grassley). The (Senate) bill would delay the mandatory minimum distribution age to 75 and provide more flexibility about student loan repayments (https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2019/05/14/new-retirement-bill-would-boost-rmd-age-to-75/?slreturn=20190417081424). The two versions are (as of now) pretty different, and only the House version is being voted on this week, but this legislation has a strong chance of emerging from both chambers. \n\nThe House (on 5/21: https://appropriations.house.gov/events/markups/fy2020-energy-water-and-defense-full-committee-appropriations-bills) and Senate (on 5/22: https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/19-05-22-schedule-for-armed-services-full-committee-markup-of-the-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2020) will markup their chamber's versions of defense appropriations. This isn't the same as holding a hearing or taking a vote; it's just to make committee-specific changes before sending a bill along to the floor. The process will probably be pretty mundane, but there's an off chance that news will break about dollar amounts appropriated to defense contractors. \n\n***\n\nHouse activity:\n\nThe House is likely to take a vote on HR 1500, a bill to put consumers first, which broadly means strengthening the CFPB and enforcing regulations on lenders (https://rules.house.gov/bill/116/hr-1500, better text at https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20190520/CP-116HR1500RH-COMPARED-RCP116-15.pdf). But it contains a pretty damaging amendment requiring credit score generators to provide a free version of the score directly to consumers (https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/COHEN_017_xml%205.14515191754165416.pdf). The additionally nice thing here is that it isolates clear losers, like TRU. \n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 5/21 on growing the cyber talent pipeline (https://homeland.house.gov/hearings-and-markups/hearings/growing-and-diversifying-cyber-talent-pipeline). Witnesses include Wesley Simpson, Chief Operating Officer, International Information System Security Certification Consortium; Richard Gallot, President, Grambling State University; Dr. Amelia Estwick, National Cybersecurity Institute, Excelsior College; and Candace Worley, Vice President and Chief Technical Strategist, McAfee. \n\nThe House will hold full committee hearings on 5/22 on modernizing infrastructure (https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/full-committee-hearing-on-lift-america-modernizing-our-infrastructure). Beyond construction, though, the bill will seek to include money for broadband buildout (https://www.benton.org/blog/house-commerce-democrats-propose-40-billion-broadband-buildout-newest-version-infrastructure), which might have an effect on telecoms and other industry players. \n\nThe House will hold full committee hearings on the tension between facial recognition and privacy (https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/hearings/full-committee-hearing-law-enforcement-s-use-of-facial-recognition-technology). This comes on the heels of municipal action against the same technology by San Francisco (https://www.theroot.com/citing-fears-of-worsening-racial-bias-san-francisco-vo-18348154920). A variety of companies are developing this technology, and the more narrowly tailored the company is to revenue based on it, the more this could have an effect (or at least is something to monitor).\n\nThe House will blast drug companies &lt;again again&gt; this week. The House will hold subcommittee hearings on 5/21 on improving prescription drug prices (https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20190521/109551/HHRG-116-IF14-20190521-SD001.pdf). A separate subcommittee will hold hearings on 5/21 on protecting patients from surprise medical bills (https://waysandmeans.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/chairman-doggett-announces-health-subcommittee-hearing-protecting). In addition, the House will hold full committee hearings on 5/21 on establishing a single-payer healthcare system (https://budget.house.gov/legislation/hearings/key-design-components-and-considerations-establishing-single-payer-health-care). Witnesses include Mark Hadley, Deputy Director, Congressional Budget Office; Dr. Jessica Banthin, Deputy Assistant Director for Health, Retirement, and Long-Term Analysis, Congressional Budget Office; and Dr. Jeffrey Kling, Associate Director for Economic Analysis, Congressional Budget Office. The hearing is almost certainly just saber-rattling (i.e. signalling threat rather than making policy), but the witness list &lt;does not&gt; include industry representatives, so the story might be shaded towards government over private industry. \n\nLastly, the House will hold subcommittee hearings on 5/22 on student debt and the oversight of for-profit colleges (https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO05/20190522/109532/HHRG-116-GO05-20190522-SD001.pdf). The witnesses are TBD, but this should be a layup to score easy Democrat points against clear losers like LOPE. \n\n***\n\nSenate activity:\n\nA pair of hearings that could be bad for FB, GOOGL, TTD, and other digital advertisers. The Senate will hold full committee hearings on 5/21 on data privacy and competition policy (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/understanding-the-digital-advertising-ecosystem-and-the-impact-of-data-privacy-and-competition-policy; witnesses TBD), while separate full committee hearings on the use of ``persuasive technology on internet platforms'' (i.e. online campaigns; https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=ED70F463-BA16-40B8-9C93-67AA5991AA6D) will happen the same day. For the latter hearing, the witnesses include Dr. Dean Eckles, Assistant Professor of Marketing, MIT Sloan School of Management; Mr. Tristan Harris, Co-Founder and Executive Director, Center for Humane Technology; Mr. Jason Hreha, former Head of Behavioral Science, Walmart; Ms. Rashida Richardson, Director of Policy Research, AI Now Institute; and Ms. Maggie Stanphill, Director, Google User Experience, Google, Inc. In case you were wondering, the Center for Humane Technology believes that ``Today’s tech platforms are caught in a race to the bottom of the brain stem to extract human attention. It's a race we're all losing. The result: addiction, social isolation, outrage, misinformation, and political polarization.'' So I'll give you one guess what their testimony will be like. If the Senate signals any real action, there will almost certainly be an appetite to mirror that action in the House.\n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on 5/22 on the risks of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) (https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/5/examining-legislation-to-address-the-risks-associated-with-per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas).

(In other words, the hearings are much more certain to happen, while the votes can be added or subtracted with much less certainty.)\n- This is not all activity, just activity most likely to be relevant to financial markets. There is also no guarantee this activity has an effect on any individual stock or market. I'm not an expert, and this is not advice. It is the beginning of a discussion.\n\n***\n\nResults from last week:\n\n- UNH dropped as low as $232 from over $240 last Friday, after the passage of HR 987 (lowering drug prices)\n- GILD dropped almost immediately on Friday morning after posting the Congressional discussion, and it extended that decline through Monday (along with the broader market, to be fair)\n- BA recordings were leaked on Wednesday night, which just happened to be the day before the FAA hearing\n- XLF had a broadly down week, despite the market pickup\n- NRG and OXY both had awful days on Thursday, suggesting truth to the adage that it's almost universally bad to appear before Congress\n\n***\n\nShared activity (across both chambers):\n\nThe House is also like to take vote on HR 1994, a bill to encourage retirement savings (https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-116hr1994ih/pdf/BILLS-116hr1994ih.pdf). This is paired with an as yet unnumbered Senate bill to do the same (https://www.portman.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/Retirement%20Security%20%26%20Savings%20Act%20-%202019%20final_0.pdf), which is important because it's bipartisan (introduced with Chuck Grassley). The (Senate) bill would delay the mandatory minimum distribution age to 75 and provide more flexibility about student loan repayments (https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2019/05/14/new-retirement-bill-would-boost-rmd-age-to-75/?slreturn=20190417081424). The two versions are (as of now) pretty different, and only the House version is being voted on this week, but this legislation has a strong chance of emerging from both chambers. \n\nThe House (on 5/21: https://appropriations.house.gov/events/markups/fy2020-energy-water-and-defense-full-committee-appropriations-bills) and Senate (on 5/22: https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/19-05-22-schedule-for-armed-services-full-committee-markup-of-the-national-defense-authorization-act-for-fiscal-year-2020) will markup their chamber's versions of defense appropriations. This isn't the same as holding a hearing or taking a vote; it's just to make committee-specific changes before sending a bill along to the floor. The process will probably be pretty mundane, but there's an off chance that news will break about dollar amounts appropriated to defense contractors. \n\n***\n\nHouse activity:\n\nThe House is likely to take a vote on HR 1500, a bill to put consumers first, which broadly means strengthening the CFPB and enforcing regulations on lenders (https://rules.house.gov/bill/116/hr-1500, better text at https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20190520/CP-116HR1500RH-COMPARED-RCP116-15.pdf). But it contains a pretty damaging amendment requiring credit score generators to provide a free version of the score directly to consumers (https://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/COHEN_017_xml%205.14515191754165416.pdf). The additionally nice thing here is that it isolates clear losers, like TRU. \n\nThe House will hold subcommittee hearings on 5/21 on growing the cyber talent pipeline (https://homeland.house.gov/hearings-and-markups/hearings/growing-and-diversifying-cyber-talent-pipeline). Witnesses include Wesley Simpson, Chief Operating Officer, International Information System Security Certification Consortium; Richard Gallot, President, Grambling State University; Dr. Amelia Estwick, National Cybersecurity Institute, Excelsior College; and Candace Worley, Vice President and Chief Technical Strategist, McAfee. \n\nThe House will hold full committee hearings on 5/22 on modernizing infrastructure (https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/full-committee-hearing-on-lift-america-modernizing-our-infrastructure). Beyond construction, though, the bill will seek to include money for broadband buildout (https://www.benton.org/blog/house-commerce-democrats-propose-40-billion-broadband-buildout-newest-version-infrastructure), which might have an effect on telecoms and other industry players. \n\nThe House will hold full committee hearings on the tension between facial recognition and privacy (https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/hearings/full-committee-hearing-law-enforcement-s-use-of-facial-recognition-technology). This comes on the heels of municipal action against the same technology by San Francisco (https://www.theroot.com/citing-fears-of-worsening-racial-bias-san-francisco-vo-18348154920). A variety of companies are developing this technology, and the more narrowly tailored the company is to revenue based on it, the more this could have an effect (or at least is something to monitor).\n\nThe House will blast drug companies &lt;again again&gt; this week. The House will hold subcommittee hearings on 5/21 on improving prescription drug prices (https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20190521/109551/HHRG-116-IF14-20190521-SD001.pdf). A separate subcommittee will hold hearings on 5/21 on protecting patients from surprise medical bills (https://waysandmeans.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/chairman-doggett-announces-health-subcommittee-hearing-protecting). In addition, the House will hold full committee hearings on 5/21 on establishing a single-payer healthcare system (https://budget.house.gov/legislation/hearings/key-design-components-and-considerations-establishing-single-payer-health-care). Witnesses include Mark Hadley, Deputy Director, Congressional Budget Office; Dr. Jessica Banthin, Deputy Assistant Director for Health, Retirement, and Long-Term Analysis, Congressional Budget Office; and Dr. Jeffrey Kling, Associate Director for Economic Analysis, Congressional Budget Office. The hearing is almost certainly just saber-rattling (i.e. signalling threat rather than making policy), but the witness list &lt;does not&gt; include industry representatives, so the story might be shaded towards government over private industry. \n\nLastly, the House will hold subcommittee hearings on 5/22 on student debt and the oversight of for-profit colleges (https://docs.house.gov/meetings/GO/GO05/20190522/109532/HHRG-116-GO05-20190522-SD001.pdf). The witnesses are TBD, but this should be a layup to score easy Democrat points against clear losers like LOPE. \n\n***\n\nSenate activity:\n\nA pair of hearings that could be bad for FB, GOOGL, TTD, and other digital advertisers. The Senate will hold full committee hearings on 5/21 on data privacy and competition policy (https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/understanding-the-digital-advertising-ecosystem-and-the-impact-of-data-privacy-and-competition-policy; witnesses TBD), while separate full committee hearings on the use of ``persuasive technology on internet platforms'' (i.e. online campaigns; https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=ED70F463-BA16-40B8-9C93-67AA5991AA6D) will happen the same day. For the latter hearing, the witnesses include Dr. Dean Eckles, Assistant Professor of Marketing, MIT Sloan School of Management; Mr. Tristan Harris, Co-Founder and Executive Director, Center for Humane Technology; Mr. Jason Hreha, former Head of Behavioral Science, Walmart; Ms. Rashida Richardson, Director of Policy Research, AI Now Institute; and Ms. Maggie Stanphill, Director, Google User Experience, Google, Inc. In case you were wondering, the Center for Humane Technology believes that ``Today’s tech platforms are caught in a race to the bottom of the brain stem to extract human attention. It's a race we're all losing. The result: addiction, social isolation, outrage, misinformation, and political polarization.'' So I'll give you one guess what their testimony will be like. If the Senate signals any real action, there will almost certainly be an appetite to mirror that action in the House.\n\nThe Senate will hold full committee hearings on 5/22 on the risks of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) (https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/5/examining-legislation-to-address-the-risks-associated-with-per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas).

As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That’s because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we’re introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features – Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance – help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.\n\n[Elon Musk Makes $500 Billion Autonomy Pitch to Investors | May 2 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-02/musk-is-said-to-make-500-billion-autonomy-pitch-to-investors)\n\nThe chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a “half-trillion dollar market cap company,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn’t open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.\n\n[Tesla delays electric semi truck production to next year | Apr 25th 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/04/25/tesla-semi-delay-electric-truck-production-next-year/)\n\nDuring its first quarter 2019 earnings call last night, Tesla confirmed that it is delaying the production of Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck program, to next year.

As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with "crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard," noted Musk in a previous tweet. We suspect that whatever a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150 can do, Tesla will one-up those figures.\n\n[Musk Says Tesla \\`Would Love to Be\' in India This Year or Next | March 15 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-15/musk-says-tesla-would-love-to-be-in-india-this-year-or-next)\n\nElon Musk isn’t giving up on bringing Tesla Inc. to India. “Would love to be there this year.

A performance version of the vehicle is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. “It has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,” Musk said. “So this thing will be really tight on corners.” The $47,000 long-range Model Y will come first in the fall of 2020, and it will have a range of 300 miles, Musk said. Tesla will also sell an all-wheel drive dual-motor version for $51,000 and a performance version for $60,000 — both of which will be available in fall 2020. The cheaper, standard range version with a range of 230 miles won’t be available until 2021, Musk said. It will sell for $39,000.\n\n[Introducing V3 Supercharging | March 6 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)\n\nTesla has more than 12,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia and our network continues to grow daily: more than 99% of the U.S. population is covered by the network, and we anticipate similar coverage in Europe by the end of 2019. Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we’re announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.\n\n[Tesla’s Model 3 was the best-selling EV in the world last year | Feb 22 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236707/tesla-model-3-2018-best-selling-ev-global)\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.\n\n[Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)\n\nAccording to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017— and that doesn’t even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it’s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a “Standby” state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car’s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alert” state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alarm” state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car’s audio system. If a car switches to “Alarm” state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They’ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.\n\n# [Leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/management)\n\n**Elon Musk - CEO**\n\nElon oversees the company\'s product strategy -- including the design, engineering and manufacturing of electric vehicles and battery products for consumers.

CEO Elon Musk is turning to the insurance business in an attempt to achieve what the automaker has so far struggled with on the vehicle pricing front: lower costs for customers. Tesla says it will start offering insurance this month that taps internal data from the AutoPilot driver-assist system to reduce rates. Musk, on Tesla\'s first-quarter earnings call, said the product would "be much more compelling than anything else out there."\n\n[Tesla (TSLA) is going to get up to $2 billion from Fiat-Chrysler to meet emission standards | May 7 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/05/07/tesla-tsla-2-billion-fiat-chrysler-emission-standards/)\n\nWe recently learned that Tesla and Fiat-Chrysler (FCA) reached a deal to pool their fleet together in Europe for the purpose of the latter avoiding emission requirement fines. It was first reported to be worth a few hundred million dollars, but FCA now says that it will pay Tesla up to $2 billion for the emission credits.\n\n[Tesla (TSLA) closes its massive $2.7 billion capital raise to boost its cash position | May 8 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/05/08/tesla-tsla-closes-capital-raise/)\n\nTesla announced today that it closed its new capital raise yesterday and it was over-subscribed with underwriters selling the additional shares and notes for total proceeds of $2.7 billion to boost Tesla’s cash position.\n\n[Elon Musk Confirms He Bought $25 Million in Tesla Stock Last Week | May 7 2019](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-tesla-stock-buy-51557202259)\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed in a regulatory filing late Monday that he purchased $25 million of his company’s stock in a public offering last week. He bought the shares on Thursday, May 2.

As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That’s because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we’re introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features – Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance – help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.\n\n[Elon Musk Makes $500 Billion Autonomy Pitch to Investors | May 2 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-02/musk-is-said-to-make-500-billion-autonomy-pitch-to-investors)\n\nThe chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a “half-trillion dollar market cap company,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn’t open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.\n\n[Tesla delays electric semi truck production to next year | Apr 25th 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/04/25/tesla-semi-delay-electric-truck-production-next-year/)\n\nDuring its first quarter 2019 earnings call last night, Tesla confirmed that it is delaying the production of Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck program, to next year. The executive also said that they are currently testing the electric trucks with maximum loads and that they are making improvements to the design. Musk previously said that Tesla aims to manufacture 100,000 electric trucks per year. Over the past two years, Tesla has been taking reservations for the electric truck and said that the production versions will have 300-mile and 500-mile range versions for $150,000 and $180,000 respectively.\n\n[The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther | April 23 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther)\n\nBeginning today, Model S and Model X now come with an all-new drivetrain design that increases each vehicle’s range substantially, achieving a landmark 370 miles and 325 miles on the EPA cycle for Model S and Model X Long Range, respectively. Using the same 100 kWh battery pack, these design and architecture updates will allow drivers to travel farther than ever before, charging less frequently and getting more range out of every dollar spent on charging. We’re also introducing a brand-new adaptive suspension system for Model S and Model X, along with a few other improvements for the best range, acceleration, and ride comfort ever, plus a Ludicrous Mode upgrade for our most loyal customers.\n\n[Elon Musk said Tesla cars will probably be better than humans at driving by the end of 2019 | Apr 17 2019](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-predicts-tesla-cars-better-than-humans-at-driving-by-end-of-2019-2019-4?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=referral)\n\nTesla vehicles will likely be better at driving than humans by the end of 2019, CEO Elon Musk said in an interview with MIT research scientist Lex Fridman. "I think it will become very quickly — maybe even towards the end of this year, but I would say I\'d be shocked if it\'s not next year, at the latest — that having a human intervene will decrease safety," Musk said. Musk later said that Tesla\'s autonomous-driving technology was improving at an exponential rate, and that it seemed to him that the company is ahead of its competitors in the autonomous-driving industry.\n\n[Introducing a More Seamless Navigate on Autopilot | April 3, 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-more-seamless-navigate-autopilot?utm_campaign=NoA&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social)\n\nSince we first introduced Navigate on Autopilot last year, Tesla drivers have traveled more than 66 million miles using the feature, and more than 9 million suggested lane changes have been successfully executed with the feature in use. Today, we’re beginning to roll out our latest version of Navigate on Autopilot for a more seamless active guidance experience. In this new version, drivers will now have the option to use Navigate on Autopilot without having to confirm lane changes via the turn stalk.\n\n[Musk Hints Tesla Pickup Truck Will Make Ram Seem "Puny" | Mar 31, 2019](https://insideevs.com/news/343601/musk-hints-tesla-pickup-truck-will-make-ram-seem-puny/)\n\nOf course, we need some context here to explain what Musk is referring to, so here\'s the tweets:@RamLover69 You would still be physically fatigued if you tried to haul 12,000 lbs of steel beams like I do every day with my Dodge Ram, 2019s motor trend truck of the year.@elonmusk 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children’s toys?It\'s not a secret that Tesla is working on an electric pickup truck. In fact, it\'s scheduled to be revealed sometime later this year. As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with "crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard," noted Musk in a previous tweet. We suspect that whatever a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150 can do, Tesla will one-up those figures.\n\n[Musk Says Tesla \\`Would Love to Be\' in India This Year or Next | March 15 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-15/musk-says-tesla-would-love-to-be-in-india-this-year-or-next)\n\nElon Musk isn’t giving up on bringing Tesla Inc. to India. “Would love to be there this year.

A performance version of the vehicle is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. “It has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,” Musk said. “So this thing will be really tight on corners.” The $47,000 long-range Model Y will come first in the fall of 2020, and it will have a range of 300 miles, Musk said. Tesla will also sell an all-wheel drive dual-motor version for $51,000 and a performance version for $60,000 — both of which will be available in fall 2020. The cheaper, standard range version with a range of 230 miles won’t be available until 2021, Musk said. It will sell for $39,000.\n\n[Introducing V3 Supercharging | March 6 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)\n\nTesla has more than 12,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia and our network continues to grow daily: more than 99% of the U.S. population is covered by the network, and we anticipate similar coverage in Europe by the end of 2019. Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we’re announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.\n\n[Tesla’s Model 3 was the best-selling EV in the world last year | Feb 22 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236707/tesla-model-3-2018-best-selling-ev-global)\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.\n\n[Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)\n\nAccording to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017— and that doesn’t even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it’s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a “Standby” state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car’s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alert” state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alarm” state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car’s audio system. If a car switches to “Alarm” state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They’ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.\n\n# [Leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/management)\n\n**Elon Musk - CEO**\n\nElon oversees the company\'s product strategy -- including the design, engineering and manufacturing of electric vehicles and battery products for consumers.

In a previous thread from today, some of you asked what the Nifty Fifty and are apparently too lazy to use google, so I wanted to regale you with its history. The Nifty Fifty was a group of high growth stock such as McDonald’s, Disney, Polaroid, Xerox, and 46 others that existed during the 1960’s and early 1970’s. These were the original FANG names that had new technology such as copiers, drive through windows, franchise business models, and cameras that developed film instantly. Competition couldn’t touch them. They were the Golden Geese and anyone who didn’t own them were basically idiots... \n\nThey benefitted from secular AND cyclical growth trends in the United States and were growing earnings by 20-30% per year. Every money manager that tried to outperform it got crushed and many of those mutual funds that underperformed went out of business. As the Nifty Fifty became more of a sure bet, more and more professionals and individuals entrusted their money to the Nifty Fifty. This led to multiples in the 50-70x range for earnings. But people didn’t care- they had outperformed for years and growth seemed limitless! why would they stop now?\n\nEventually, the party was over in the 1970’s and the Nifty Fifty got crushed to the tune of 70-80%. Sometimes it was earnings slowing down, sometimes just multiple compression, other times inflation just ripped everyone to shreds, sometimes new technology came around that made them obsolete. Some went bankrupt. \n\nI’m not sure what the lesson is here. Maybe it is there is no such thing as a sure thing? I don’t know if the QQQ or SPY or FANG is a similar bubble or not- but I just like the story and thought you guys would like it too.'), ('Snap Employees Looking at Snaps', 'Snap Employees Looking at SnapsI\'m still not sure how this stock is making money.

[https://imgur.com/a/eub7tPi](https://imgur.com/a/eub7tPi) The first piece of data set I am watching is the CBOE SKEW index. SKEW tracks the slope of the implied volatility curve of OTM SPX puts. Essentially it tracks the demand for protection of black swan events or tail risk hedges. Right now this index is insanely low. In the past 8 years, the index has only been this low twice, October 15 2014, and January 3rd 2019. After the first occurrence, SPY rallied more than 10% in the next 30 days and we all know what happened after January 3rd. Right now the larger players that trade SPX contracts are demanding very low amounts of downside protection.\n\n2. [https://imgur.com/a/Yzel8Eg](https://imgur.com/a/Yzel8Eg) Next is the VIX Call/Put ratio. The 10 period moving average of the VIX C/P ratio is noticeably low and has been one of my favorite leading indicators. On may 3rd 2019 I made a comment expressing my concerns that the VIX Call/Put ratio was extremely high and that we should expect some volatility in the markets. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk04nw/what\\_are\\_your\\_moves\\_tomorrow\\_may\\_03/emdm7d2/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bk04nw/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_may_03/emdm7d2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).

[https://imgur.com/a/JwPL0xQ](https://imgur.com/a/JwPL0xQ) Lastly, my own model that utilizes LSTM neural networks to forecast the SPY closing prices predicted the slump we have seen the past two days and is predicting a rally closing out this week and into the next. I use the past 23 years of Closing price, RSI, and Momentum and If you are curious about the model check my comment history for information and back tests. \n\nWith some important economic data coming out tomorrow the extremely near term outlook is unpredictable so take that into account.

I believe analysts are very retarded and they're missing very basic stuff, focusing on shenanigans. Here are my thoughts. This is a serious DD for once, but I'm sure if I posted it on r/investing, I would get immediately downvoted to the ground (they are such retards, Jesus). \n\nPart of my DD is very subjective, but I feel subjectivity plays an important part. If you are always perfectly objective, then you agree with the market's current price and everything is justified, and you're never going to make any money.\n\n**I'll start with the fundamentals, then technicals.**\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\n**-Right now, Tesla is the only company I can imagine being a 20-bagger.** There are others of course, but I can't identify them. I have a high risk tolerance and have told myself for two years that if Tesla dipped I would go all in. So I'm very happy about the current drop, especially since the dip is not really justified (just a bunch of analysts snowballing into lowering their PTs)\n\n**-Industry isn't destiny.** First of all, worst case scenario Tesla is a profitable auto company, worth $50B. But keep in mind people didn't believe in Apple, because they were selling hardware. Which isn't the whole story: iOs, Mac Os, etc. are 50% of the product. A mac without Mac Os is essentially a well-designed PC. I'm not even going to mention how valuable iOs is. Just because you buy the hardware (a mac, an iPhone...) doesn't mean you don't buy the OS: it's included in the price. Which is different than PCs for which you buy the hardware + windows.\n\nPeople don't get that Tesla is the same: the software is 50% of the product. Actually, even more, since you can literally control, tweak, improve, fix everything through software. And I'm not even talking about autopilot: for example, teslas can now detect issues and immediately order parts themselves to be delivered to the local repair center.\n\nThere's more: Teslas can now also detect issues in the making, while the car still works, and have a checking appointment scheduled in order to check the issue, BEFORE the car breaks down. Can you imagine how much people would pay to have a car that never unexpectedly breaks down?\n\nAnd that's just one example of things you can do with software.\n\n**-Design:** the design is so superior. Yeah some people don't like it, just like Apple's design and design choices. They still make a shitton of money. Tesla's design is just next level.\n\n**-Data:** not even going to expand on the value of the data collected by cars and all the purposes it could serve.\n\n**-I find that in the past, everything I've been obsessed with has turned into incredibly profitable businesses.** I found myself obsessed with Tesla since the model 3. I have no idea why. But this was even before I started looking at the stock.\n\n**-Brand value and advertising:** unbelievable how good the brand is. How everyone knows it with zero advertising. I'm a high school teacher in france, in the middle of NOWHERE, and the other day I saw a student wearing a tesla hoodie. It's the cool thing now. The next generation will be the Tesla generation.\n\n**-On a personal level, I really don't care much for cars.** I thought all I needed is AC and cruise control basically. I try to invest all my money and a car is just an expense. I bought mine for 7,000 euro, great car. Great design, looks decent. Reliable, low fuel usage (74 MPG). I couldn't be happier with it, and yet I know I will buy a model 3 at some point. I will hate myself for spending that much and I would never have considered, in my life, spending over 10,000 euro for a car. Yeah.\n\n**-Oil keeps rising, and ICE cars are going to be banned.** In Strasbourg, in France where I'm from, diesel will be banned from the city as soon as 2024. Electric is the future, better for quality of driving and quality of life. Which means that of course, there will still be ICE cars for some time, and the shift will be gradual and never 100%, but the room for growth in this market is enormous.\n\n**-The demand issues are a joke.** Here in France, I have yet to see a single model 3. I don't know if demand will be an issue in the future, but for now there is still huge room for expansion.\n\n**-The bankruptcy concerns are also a joke.** I would be much more concerned if we were in a deep recession.\n\n**-The financials are bad,** but first, they have had profitable quarters. Moreover, I believe the dilution will be worth it over the long term. So yeah right now it doesn't seem shareholder-friendly but the value creation is so intense that it will still be positive. I will add that I was extremely skeptical on Tesla for years. I then realized the potential.\n\n**-Obviously, a DCF approach doesn't work.** I've tried. So indeed, there is a part of belief in this, and it is indeed a risky play, there's no denying it. But just look at the growth and rising revenue, coupled with all the positive things I mentioned. Add to that the relatively low bankruptcy probability. There is a considerable chance it will work out.\n\n**-To expand on my previous point, for cases like these, sometimes the story is more important than the current financials.** I know it sounds like bubble talk but consider this: the market has no idea how to value Tesla, and that's normal because no one has an idea how to properly value it, because it's impossible. If you focus on the story, it is obvious that what they have achieved and what they will achieve will be worth a whole lot. If you approach this like Mr. Market, then you will miss it. Let me add that my risk tolerance is high, and I'm perfectly fine losing money. In fact I would kick myself much more for missing an opportunity than staying on the side out of fear.\n\n**-Competition is a joke.** Auto manufacturers in general are not agile enough. They make cars based on the ICE model (see the Bolt for example). And, again, let's talk about software: their software is absolute crap. The user interface is, but also and more importantly what's behind it. No other manufacturer is even able to make over the air updates....\nYeah some people hate Apple and prefer Android. That's fine, Apple is still a trillion dollar company with a small market share.\n\n**-Of course, there are a million of possibilities and uses that come out of this software approach.** When they bought the original iPhone, people had no idea all the uses it could generate now. We are starting to see a couple things like sentry mode, or autopilot, or summon, but there will be many more. The software approach makes everything possible. I have a macbook pro from 2013, this thing is SO MUCH BETTER on the current Mac Os than the one it was shipped with in 2013.\n\n\nThats all I can think of from the top of my head but I'm sure there are other things. Will add them later if I think about it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Now let's talk about the short term and technicals, and why I have been and will keep averaging down:**\n\n-I don't believe it will dip below $150, or at least not much lower. Despite the recent negativity, plenty of people are still hyped beyond belief.\n\n-The more Tesla dips, the more likely it is someone will try to buy them out, possibly aggressively. If this occurs and I haven't averaged down, I'm fucked if the buyout price is lower than my average cost. No way of recuperating the difference. Many people, especially on r/investing, laugh at the possibility of Tesla being bought out. That's retarded. Although it would indeed be a nightmare to manage the company, many giants right now don't know how to make good use of their cash and some CEOs would die for a growth opportunity like that. If Tesla dipped to $20b valuation or less, even with all the liabilities it would be very, VERY cheap especially if you could add the financial firepower of a huge company. So not extremely likely, but I wouldn't dismiss that possibility.\n\n-Frankly it just seems unrealistic for Tesla to be valued at $20B or less. Not with the current outlook at least. If there's a recession, sure, but then everything's going to shit, not just TSLA."), ('Hey guys whats up with this FDIC insurance? Can I get my lost money due to trade war back?

So I'm very happy about the current drop, especially since the dip is not really justified (just a bunch of analysts snowballing into lowering their PTs)\n\n**-Industry isn't destiny.** First of all, worst case scenario Tesla is a profitable auto company, worth $50B. But keep in mind people didn't believe in Apple, because they were selling hardware. Which isn't the whole story: iOs, Mac Os, etc. are 50% of the product. A mac without Mac Os is essentially a well-designed PC. I'm not even going to mention how valuable iOs is. Just because you buy the hardware (a mac, an iPhone...) doesn't mean you don't buy the OS: it's included in the price. Which is different than PCs for which you buy the hardware + windows.\n\nPeople don't get that Tesla is the same: the software is 50% of the product. Actually, even more, since you can literally control, tweak, improve, fix everything through software. And I'm not even talking about autopilot: for example, teslas can now detect issues and immediately order parts themselves to be delivered to the local repair center.\n\nThere's more: Teslas can now also detect issues in the making, while the car still works, and have a checking appointment scheduled in order to check the issue, BEFORE the car breaks down. Can you imagine how much people would pay to have a car that never unexpectedly breaks down?\n\nAnd that's just one example of things you can do with software.\n\n**-Design:** the design is so superior. Yeah some people don't like it, just like Apple's design and design choices. They still make a shitton of money. Tesla's design is just next level.\n\n**-Data:** not even going to expand on the value of the data collected by cars and all the purposes it could serve.\n\n**-I find that in the past, everything I've been obsessed with has turned into incredibly profitable businesses.** I found myself obsessed with Tesla since the model 3. I have no idea why. But this was even before I started looking at the stock.\n\n**-Brand value and advertising:** unbelievable how good the brand is. How everyone knows it with zero advertising. I'm a high school teacher in france, in the middle of NOWHERE, and the other day I saw a student wearing a tesla hoodie. It's the cool thing now. The next generation will be the Tesla generation.\n\n**-On a personal level, I really don't care much for cars.** I thought all I needed is AC and cruise control basically. I try to invest all my money and a car is just an expense. I bought mine for 7,000 euro, great car. Great design, looks decent. Reliable, low fuel usage (74 MPG). I couldn't be happier with it, and yet I know I will buy a model 3 at some point. I will hate myself for spending that much and I would never have considered, in my life, spending over 10,000 euro for a car. Yeah.\n\n**-Oil keeps rising, and ICE cars are going to be banned.** In Strasbourg, in France where I'm from, diesel will be banned from the city as soon as 2024. Electric is the future, better for quality of driving and quality of life. Which means that of course, there will still be ICE cars for some time, and the shift will be gradual and never 100%, but the room for growth in this market is enormous.\n\n**-The demand issues are a joke.** Here in France, I have yet to see a single model 3. I don't know if demand will be an issue in the future, but for now there is still huge room for expansion.\n\n**-The bankruptcy concerns are also a joke.** I would be much more concerned if we were in a deep recession.\n\n**-The financials are bad,** but first, they have had profitable quarters. Moreover, I believe the dilution will be worth it over the long term. So yeah right now it doesn't seem shareholder-friendly but the value creation is so intense that it will still be positive. I will add that I was extremely skeptical on Tesla for years. I then realized the potential.\n\n**-Obviously, a DCF approach doesn't work.** I've tried. So indeed, there is a part of belief in this, and it is indeed a risky play, there's no denying it. But just look at the growth and rising revenue, coupled with all the positive things I mentioned. Add to that the relatively low bankruptcy probability. There is a considerable chance it will work out.\n\n**-To expand on my previous point, for cases like these, sometimes the story is more important than the current financials.** I know it sounds like bubble talk but consider this: the market has no idea how to value Tesla, and that's normal because no one has an idea how to properly value it, because it's impossible. If you focus on the story, it is obvious that what they have achieved and what they will achieve will be worth a whole lot. If you approach this like Mr. Market, then you will miss it. Let me add that my risk tolerance is high, and I'm perfectly fine losing money. In fact I would kick myself much more for missing an opportunity than staying on the side out of fear.\n\n**-Competition is a joke.** Auto manufacturers in general are not agile enough. They make cars based on the ICE model (see the Bolt for example). And, again, let's talk about software: their software is absolute crap. The user interface is, but also and more importantly what's behind it. No other manufacturer is even able to make over the air updates....\nYeah some people hate Apple and prefer Android. That's fine, Apple is still a trillion dollar company with a small market share.\n\n**-Of course, there are a million of possibilities and uses that come out of this software approach.** When they bought the original iPhone, people had no idea all the uses it could generate now. We are starting to see a couple things like sentry mode, or autopilot, or summon, but there will be many more. The software approach makes everything possible. I have a macbook pro from 2013, this thing is SO MUCH BETTER on the current Mac Os than the one it was shipped with in 2013.\n\n\nThats all I can think of from the top of my head but I'm sure there are other things. Will add them later if I think about it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Now let's talk about the short term and technicals, and why I have been and will keep averaging down:**\n\n-I don't believe it will dip below $150, or at least not much lower. Despite the recent negativity, plenty of people are still hyped beyond belief.\n\n-The more Tesla dips, the more likely it is someone will try to buy them out, possibly aggressively. If this occurs and I haven't averaged down, I'm fucked if the buyout price is lower than my average cost. No way of recuperating the difference. Many people, especially on r/investing, laugh at the possibility of Tesla being bought out. That's retarded. Although it would indeed be a nightmare to manage the company, many giants right now don't know how to make good use of their cash and some CEOs would die for a growth opportunity like that. If Tesla dipped to $20b valuation or less, even with all the liabilities it would be very, VERY cheap especially if you could add the financial firepower of a huge company. So not extremely likely, but I wouldn't dismiss that possibility.\n\n-Frankly it just seems unrealistic for Tesla to be valued at $20B or less. Not with the current outlook at least. If there's a recession, sure, but then everything's going to shit, not just TSLA.")], '2019-06-02': [('u/rhibkr’s investment club puts in a market order for 700 shares of TSLA at $243.

Dow had its largest one week gain of 2019 after FED alluded to the fact, they may consider cutting interest rates. Obviously, the punch in the dick was Trumps announcement of tariffs on Mexico the day after I created the post above. While we are now well above those levels and even appear to have a trade deal with them now, it was not very fun holding calls that day. Ended up rolling them out so Theta didn’t fuck me over. \n\nI ended up selling to early on Thursday, but the Friday jobs number could have gone either way so I decided to get out. I am now net delta negative after opening some positions Friday, more on that latter. I appreciate the support the last post got along with people sending me pictures of their returns, was cool to be able to help some people out.\n\nOn to this week\n\nI’ll start off by saying this won’t be the same type of post I made last week as well as it may be considerably longer. Focusing more on the model I use, if that doesn’t float your boat, you don’t have to read this, or do and shit post below. Either one works for me. \n\nThe data\n\n1. I’ll skip the SKEW index for now. It has increased since my last post but day to day it is not a particularly helpful indicator. \n\n2. [https://imgur.com/a/nTjPATV](https://imgur.com/a/nTjPATV) The 10 period moving average of the VIX call put ratio has increased a fair amount since my last post indicating there are increasingly more long bets on the VIX over the course of this rally. I will also add that the VIX has held up surprisingly well the past week, indicating the larger insinuations and traders that trade SPX options are buying more downside protection even with this rally. **Whenever VIX and SPX have a positive correlation, it generally is not a good sign**.\n\n3. [https://imgur.com/a/qUJX49s](https://imgur.com/a/qUJX49s) The DIX has fallen slightly over this rally, nothing to shocking though and is still fairly high. Something that does concern me is the GEX. The GEX is a measure of market makers hedging obligations and the sharp rise over the past week looks somewhat similar to that of May 16 2019, and Nov 7 2018. Not an ideal time to buy after the GEX spikes. For more info see [https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/docs](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/docs)\n\n4. From a TA perspective, a **pull back to start the week is by far the most likely outcome**. For SPY QQQ and IWM, there is bearish divergence on the PPO and Momentum and the Slow stochastic is about to cross below 80 on the 30 min chart. The hourly tell similar storied but the Slow Stochastic is slightly farther from 80. Look for this to stick below 80 as a sign the short-term trend has changed. [https://imgur.com/a/9g9M9ru](https://imgur.com/a/9g9M9ru)\n\nThe model\n\nI have made some significant changes to the model I use. I decided to go from using inputs based solely off of the close of SPY, to using a **broader array of inputs such as oil prices and treasury yields** as well as I ramped up the number of Epochs used. Unfortunately, I have decided to keep the exact data/input structure I used private for my own reasons, mainly because I feel as if it is my secret sauce. I’ve spent quite a bit of time working on it and making the methods more well-known doesn’t exactly do me any favors. That being said, if you have any questions/criticisms regarding the model, please look at my older posts before asking them and I may or may not answer them. \n\nHere are the back test for the past ten weeks [https://imgur.com/a/ceuKDCr](https://imgur.com/a/ceuKDCr), sorry for the formatting, I didn’t feel like making each one its own picture. An important note, is that I switched from having the forecast and SPY having separate axis, to having a **shared y-axis using a percentage change from t=0**. One reason I think I missed timed my long entry last week is that I was using a relative scale. \n\nIf I had used the % scale, I would have seen that the model was predicting a 4% downside to start off the period, but SPY had only fell 1.5% when I was looking to go long. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess. The only back test that did not turn out so good was the one starting 3/27. While SPY did finish that period with a slight pull back, the model predicted a much more significant down turn which we did not see. \n\nHere is the sum off the back tests along with the forecast for the next two weeks: [https://imgur.com/a/3AUFoe1](https://imgur.com/a/3AUFoe1). I went with the dual axis as over a long period time using a percentage method separate the graphs so that they are not as easy to compare, seeing as they are 20 day forecasts I think that this makes the most sense over a long period of time. **The correlation between the forecasts and SPY is .305**. Not perfect but doesn’t appear to be random. I will have to get a larger sample size to confirm this latter. \n\nHere is the forecast on a % terms: [https://imgur.com/a/Ixzn0eQ](https://imgur.com/a/Ixzn0eQ). I will be looking for a pull back early this weak to enter long positions and close my 6/14 call credit spreads, **looking for about 284-285 on SPY**. From my back tests it is clear that some movements are exaggerated and often don’t occur exactly on the predicted day, so I think it is safe to say you should not expect a 4% drop Monday. You’ll have to use some other data point to confirm a near term bottom.\n\nLooking at the forecast together with the data, I will be playing call credit spreads, continuing to hold my SPY, V, and ROKU call credit spreads I opened Friday, and looking to get into ITM call debt spreads late this week. I will add that holding naked calls in this environment does not offer a favorable risk to reward ratio. ITM debt spreads will be my preferred strategy until the trade/economic outlook is clearer. Especially sense the Mexico trade news came out after hours Friday, I have no idea how the futures will react.\n\nAs always, ***This Is Not Advice To Buy Or Sell Any Security*** and you need to do your own research to come to your own conclusions.

As some may know, I've made some good ones in my short month as a member. If you followed me and did what I said you'd be way green. I've made about 12k since being a member.. It started after antitrust news and I predicted a surging ADBE because it dropped and had nothing to do with that, then went on and predicted FBs huge rise when it was at a laughable 170, my latest gem was a couple days ago when I predicted a quick rise in CRM. And while CRM is likely not done and will reach 160s by next week, I'm on to new things.\n\nAdmittedly, this new prediction isn't my usual variety. I tend to target stocks that have fallen for what I consider fake reasons, and are due for a recovery to their normal trading range. Thos is normally news related drops. Was the case with ADBE, FB, and CRM. All of which are back to their ranges so new opportunity is limited, but CRM still has potential. This new prediction isn't technically undervalued, or even below its normal trading range, two metrics I normally use, but it is affected by recent news that could affect it and recent price movement that helps gauge it. I'll explain.\n\nPrediction: AMD for tomorrow, and possibly Friday. It could reach as high as 34, but probably closer to 32. It was trading in the 27-29.5 range for weeks, back and forth, so we already know it is capable of seesawing. Once it broke 29.5 resistance that is now its support, so I don't expect a drop lower than that without some devastating news. It closed near 30.5 today and didn't go much lower for long, good sign. Here's why the prediction. When Trump tweeted something recently about meeting Xi it went above 32. This shows trade concerns weigh heavily on AMD, and chips in general. The FED just gave their rate plan and the markets will begin pricing in a 100% chance of a rate cut in July. This pricing in should affect whole market tomorrow, but maybe moreso on China related stocks. The rate cuts are largely to counter damage done by Trumps trade war. Damage that would be done to AMD and other chip stocks. Since the damage will be mitigated without a shadow of a doubt now, I see a rise incoming for AMD closer to the post Trump tweet about meeting with Xi, which should be around 32, but small chance of higher. \n\nSo get AMD calls at open if no gap up. I got them at end of day today, and throught as it dipped. Good luck all.

So instead of exercising my buy option for me, the assigned my sell option.

I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 1st, 2019.\n\n# **What to watch in markets for the week ahead: After G-20, focus shifts to jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/28/what-to-watch-in-markets-for-the-week-ahead-after-g-20-focus-shifts-to-jobs-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The monthly jobs number is always important but this time, it could be even bigger news, since it may actually help tell us how much the Fed will cut interest rates this summer.\n*****\n&gt; The report won’t be the only bit of data the Fed will look at before it meets July 30-31, but it could show whether the economy has hit a weak enough streak in hiring that the Fed will want to act.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect that 158,000 jobs were created in June, up sharply from the disappointing 75,000 in May, according to Refinitiv. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.6% and average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; “It’s going to be better than last month. Otherwise, we’ve got a problem,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Natixis Americas. “We’re saying it’s something like 130,000. If it’s weak, the markets are going to assume the Fed’s going 50 [basis points]. If you have a number in June, like you had in May, they would go 50.”\n*****\n&gt; After the weekend’s G-20 headlines, the jobs report is the big focus for markets in the coming week, along with OPEC’s two-day meeting Monday and Tuesday. OPEC is widely expected to extend 1.2 million barrels a day in production cuts in a deal with Russia, and oil isn’t expected to react much, unless there’s a surprise.\n*****\n&gt; Markets also kick off the third quarter in the holiday-shortened Fourth of July week, after one of the best first halves in more than 20 years for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs report follows some other important data in the coming week, and comes as the slowing in the economy is taking a worrisome turn and beginning to hit some of the consumer-related data. A lagging indicator, the jobs data may provide some guidance on the well-being of consumers, which drive about 70% of the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; Both consumer confidence and consumer sentiment readings in June were weaker amid concerns about trade. Consumer spending increased just 0.2% in May, leading some economists on Friday to slash their expectations for both consumption in the second quarter and second quarter economic growth. J.P. Morgan economists trimmed their second quarter GDP forecast to 1.5% from 1.9%\n*****\n&gt; The economy now exits the second quarter, and first half of the year, with some big doubts hanging over the outlook. That makes some of the data in the coming week, the first week of the third quarter, even more relevant. For instance, ISM manufacturing and PMI manufacturing data are released Monday. Both are important to the outlook or the manufacturing sector, which has been weak. Car sales are released Tuesday, and they will also be an important look into manufacturing and the consumer.\n*****\n&gt; “If the jobs number is good but let’s say the CPI and retail sales data turns out to be a lot softer, or GDP revised meaningfully down, it’s not just employment. The possibility of the Fed doing more than 25 [basis points] does not end with the employment report,” LaVorgna said.\n*****\n&gt; The May jobs report was an important turning point for markets, changing the minority view of some economists that the Fed could cut interest rates into a consensus expectation. But that consensus has not settled on when and how much the Fed will chop rate.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed signaled after its June meeting that it was leaning toward a cut, exiting its neutral posture, and that it could act soon if it had to.\n*****\n&gt; So the jobs report, “is important for better or worse. The market’s been bullying the Fed for the last couple of decades and if anything, it’s gotten even more powerful. If it’s weak, the market is going to push them to do more, but the Fed will be fearful of disappointing the market. They’ll also be fearful the economy is weak against the backdrop of trade uncertainty,” said LaVorgna.\n*****\n&gt; At this point, fed funds futures are pricing in a full quarter-point rate cut for the July meeting and a portion of a second cut. Economists mostly expect two cuts this year, whether starting in July or September, with another likely by either September or December.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/vLg0YrK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cpGJG5e.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OMBCnxB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/icdbnZ8.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qzritvf.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PxxJq9E.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7sAo6Sh.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZCRsP8T.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for next month:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LA02AwI.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\nNONE.\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/lckxzcG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rtdblNh.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# July 4th Market Returns\n\n&gt; With the first half winding down to a close, Summer is in full swing as July 4th quickly approaches. While the days leading up to or after July 4th are usually on the quiet side with many people taking vacations, for the stock market, it is usually a relatively positive week. The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's performance during the July 4th week measuring performance from the Friday before July 4th until the Friday after. In years where July 4th falls on a Friday or Saturday, we measure the S&amp;P 500's performance in the week leading up to July 4th.\n\n&gt; For the July 4th week, going back to 1969, the S&amp;P 500 has seen an average gain of 0.32% with positive returns 60% of the time. In the charts below, we have also included green shading in years where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half (as it is this year). In those years, returns during the July 4th week have been much better with an average gain of 0.93% and positive returns 79% of the time. In fact, the last time the S&amp;P 500 was down during the July 4th week in a year where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half was in 1986!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Week.png))**\n\n&gt; Similar to the July 4th week, the day before July 4th has also historically been positive but not nearly to the same degree. On those days, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.04% with positive returns only slightly more than half of the time (54%). In years where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the day before July 4th is considerably better, averaging a gain of 0.17% with gains 64% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Day-Before.png))**\n\n&gt; With people out celebrating the July 4th holiday, the hangover sets in after. As shown below, the average S&amp;P 500 change on the trading day after July 4th is a decline of 0.18% with gains only 42% of the time. In years when the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the declines aren't as bad, but at -0.12% and gains only half of the time, they aren't positive either. This year the day after July 4th will also feature the June Non-Farm Payrolls report. That will be fun!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Day-After.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 6/28/19\n\n&gt; In posts yesterday and Monday, we made note of the increasingly disappointing economic data out of the US relative to expectations so far in 2019. This week's data only added to the woes as the Citi Economic Surprise Index for the US now sits only 0.73% above its April low.\n\n&gt; Over half of this week's releases came in worse than the prior period of estimates. The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index was the first release this week showing improvements from the April data and coming in above estimates, but the indicator is still showing contracting activity (reading below zero). The Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also was out on Monday showing far weaker results. Later in the week, on Thursday, the Kansas City Fed released their own manufacturing activity index completing our Five Fed Composite which is painting a bleak picture for the manufacturing sector. There was also a good amount of housing data this week with overall solid results including stronger than expected home prices (via the FHFA index and S&amp;P CoreLogic's Case-Shiller Index) but disappointing new home sales on Tuesday, improved MBA Mortgage Applications on Wednesday, and a much better Pending Home Sales print on Thursday. Chicago PMI dropped below 50 on Friday, which is a sign of contraction, but Michigan Confidence beat estimates. One other major release this week was the third and final release of quarterly GDP, which held steady at 3.1% QoQ but was below estimates of an increase to 3.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-Eco1.png))**\n\n&gt; Despite a shortened week due to the July 4th holiday, next week is set up to be a busy one. On Monday, Markit will release their final June PMI on manufacturing alongside the ISM reading later that morning. While Markit measures on manufacturing are expected to hold steady at 50.1, ISM data is anticipated to fall 1.1 down to 51. The only release Tuesday will be data on vehicle sales, which are expected to fall to 17 mm SAAR. On Thursday, there will be no releases and US markets will be shuttered in observance of the July 4th holiday. Additionally, markets will close early (1:00 PM EST) on Wednesday. In spite of this shortened session and day off, there is a huge slug of data to be released Wednesday. Following up the manufacturing PMIs, Markit and ISM non-manufacturing indicators are all due out on Wednesday. In the late morning, final May data on Factory, Durable, and Capital Goods Orders are also going to be released. Alongside the standard Wednesday release of MBA Mortgage Applications, other weekly data that is typically released on Thursday will be pushed ahead one day including Initial Jobless Claims and Bloomberg Consumer Comfort. ADP employment numbers are expected to show improvements when it releases on Wednesday ahead of Friday's Nonfarm payrolls report, which is also forecasting a solid improvement from the previous month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-Eco2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Trend Analyzer - 6/28/19 - Teetering On Overbought\n\n&gt; After the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) set a new all-time high last Thursday, stocks have yet to make a push back above these levels as all of the major index ETFs sit below where they were at last Thursday's close. This pullback was partially a function of the large-cap major index ETFs like the Russell 1000 (IWB) working off overbought levels. Whereas all of these were overbought last week, currently only the Dow (DIA) still sits in overbought territory although other large caps are teetering on joining DIA. The Core S&amp;P Small Cap (IJR) and Micro Cap (IWC) are only lower by 0.41% and 0.33%, respectively. These are smaller losses compared to other ETFs which lost around 1%. Ironically, this outperformance also comes as IJR and IWC are now showing sideways trends rather uptrends across the rest of the ETFs. Granted, not all small-cap indices have been outperforming. Another small-cap index, the Russell 2000 (IWM), has seen performance more inline with other ETFs, declining 1.07%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-TA.png))**\n\n&gt; Every sector except Materials (XLB) is lower over the last week. As shown in our Trend Analyzersnapshot below, it's the defensives that are finally lagging, with Real Estate (XLRE) down 4% and Utilities (XLU) down 2% since last Thursday's close. At the moment, only Materials and Health Care are overbought, while the rest are neutral.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-TA2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Falls to the Bottom of the Pack\n\n&gt; In a post earlier this week, we provided an update to the Citi Economic Surprise indices broken out by region. With economic data in the US continuing to disappoint this week, the Citi Surprise index (percentage of economic indicators that are beating vs. missing estimates) for the US is coming increasingly close to taking out its late April low and declining to its lowest levels in two years. What's also notable about the current reading is that at the most recent reading of -67.5, the surprise index for the US is more negative than any other country or region that this series tracks.\n\n&gt; Below we compare the Citi surprise reading for the US and Europe over the last twelve months, and what a reversal it has been. Heading into 2019, economic data in the US was coming in much better relative to expectations versus Europe, but ever since then, data in the US has been getting progressively worse relative to expectations, while data in Europe has been consistently improving.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062719-Surprise.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# July’s First Trading Day—Most Bullish Day, S&amp;P 500 has Advanced 85.7% of the Time\n\n&gt; July’s first trading day is the best performing first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1,175.74 points since 1998. Over the past 21 years, DJIA’s first trading day of July has produced gains 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.40%. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 85.7% of the time (average gain 0.42%). NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 76.2% (0.26% average gain). No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 21 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/41bfded64b6be009498141e06d860cc6/tumblr_inline_ptt611r7Jm1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Pre-Election Year July Performance Mixed\n\n&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019).\n\n&gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the third weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital.

Leaks show that AMD is either on par, or even beating intel, at a much lower price point.

Intel makes most of their moolah on servers, where they can jack up the prices because there is no real competition. AMD has also come in, guns blazing, with server chips that are finally worth paying attention to. Google's stadia (game streaming service) is running off of AMD. Fixes to recent CPU vulnerabilities like meltdown, spectre, Rowhammer, all (significantly) affect Intel computing performance, something that enterprise customers care about a lot. AMD has been a lot more uptight about their security.\n\nIntel has a market cap of 200 bil, while AMD has a market cap of 30 bil. AMD is definitely not going to 200 bil, but there is room for growth.\n\nConcerns: P/E ratio of AMD is a little high, 121 vs Intel's 10. Could be a little overpriced, considering how a lot of investors realize the value in AMD. P/E ratio of 40 is normal in semiconductors.\n\nHowever, considering room for future, explosive growth, I think it literally can't go tits up.\n\nLong AMD, price target $60 (if you hold) I'll probably hold for 4 months.\nDisclaimer: I own shares of AMD"), ('How to be not completly retarded?

I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 1st, 2019.\n\n# **What to watch in markets for the week ahead: After G-20, focus shifts to jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/28/what-to-watch-in-markets-for-the-week-ahead-after-g-20-focus-shifts-to-jobs-report.html)**\n*****\n&gt; The monthly jobs number is always important but this time, it could be even bigger news, since it may actually help tell us how much the Fed will cut interest rates this summer.\n*****\n&gt; The report won’t be the only bit of data the Fed will look at before it meets July 30-31, but it could show whether the economy has hit a weak enough streak in hiring that the Fed will want to act.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect that 158,000 jobs were created in June, up sharply from the disappointing 75,000 in May, according to Refinitiv. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.6% and average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; “It’s going to be better than last month. Otherwise, we’ve got a problem,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Natixis Americas. “We’re saying it’s something like 130,000. If it’s weak, the markets are going to assume the Fed’s going 50 [basis points]. If you have a number in June, like you had in May, they would go 50.”\n*****\n&gt; After the weekend’s G-20 headlines, the jobs report is the big focus for markets in the coming week, along with OPEC’s two-day meeting Monday and Tuesday. OPEC is widely expected to extend 1.2 million barrels a day in production cuts in a deal with Russia, and oil isn’t expected to react much, unless there’s a surprise.\n*****\n&gt; Markets also kick off the third quarter in the holiday-shortened Fourth of July week, after one of the best first halves in more than 20 years for stocks.\n*****\n&gt; The jobs report follows some other important data in the coming week, and comes as the slowing in the economy is taking a worrisome turn and beginning to hit some of the consumer-related data. A lagging indicator, the jobs data may provide some guidance on the well-being of consumers, which drive about 70% of the U.S. economy.\n*****\n&gt; Both consumer confidence and consumer sentiment readings in June were weaker amid concerns about trade. Consumer spending increased just 0.2% in May, leading some economists on Friday to slash their expectations for both consumption in the second quarter and second quarter economic growth. J.P. Morgan economists trimmed their second quarter GDP forecast to 1.5% from 1.9%\n*****\n&gt; The economy now exits the second quarter, and first half of the year, with some big doubts hanging over the outlook. That makes some of the data in the coming week, the first week of the third quarter, even more relevant. For instance, ISM manufacturing and PMI manufacturing data are released Monday. Both are important to the outlook or the manufacturing sector, which has been weak. Car sales are released Tuesday, and they will also be an important look into manufacturing and the consumer.\n*****\n&gt; “If the jobs number is good but let’s say the CPI and retail sales data turns out to be a lot softer, or GDP revised meaningfully down, it’s not just employment. The possibility of the Fed doing more than 25 [basis points] does not end with the employment report,” LaVorgna said.\n*****\n&gt; The May jobs report was an important turning point for markets, changing the minority view of some economists that the Fed could cut interest rates into a consensus expectation. But that consensus has not settled on when and how much the Fed will chop rate.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed signaled after its June meeting that it was leaning toward a cut, exiting its neutral posture, and that it could act soon if it had to.\n*****\n&gt; So the jobs report, “is important for better or worse. The market’s been bullying the Fed for the last couple of decades and if anything, it’s gotten even more powerful. If it’s weak, the market is going to push them to do more, but the Fed will be fearful of disappointing the market. They’ll also be fearful the economy is weak against the backdrop of trade uncertainty,” said LaVorgna.\n*****\n&gt; At this point, fed funds futures are pricing in a full quarter-point rate cut for the July meeting and a portion of a second cut. Economists mostly expect two cuts this year, whether starting in July or September, with another likely by either September or December.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/vLg0YrK.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cpGJG5e.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OMBCnxB.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/icdbnZ8.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qzritvf.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PxxJq9E.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7sAo6Sh.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZCRsP8T.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for next month:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LA02AwI.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\nNONE.\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/lckxzcG.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/rtdblNh.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# July 4th Market Returns\n\n&gt; With the first half winding down to a close, Summer is in full swing as July 4th quickly approaches. While the days leading up to or after July 4th are usually on the quiet side with many people taking vacations, for the stock market, it is usually a relatively positive week. The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's performance during the July 4th week measuring performance from the Friday before July 4th until the Friday after. In years where July 4th falls on a Friday or Saturday, we measure the S&amp;P 500's performance in the week leading up to July 4th.\n\n&gt; For the July 4th week, going back to 1969, the S&amp;P 500 has seen an average gain of 0.32% with positive returns 60% of the time. In the charts below, we have also included green shading in years where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half (as it is this year). In those years, returns during the July 4th week have been much better with an average gain of 0.93% and positive returns 79% of the time. In fact, the last time the S&amp;P 500 was down during the July 4th week in a year where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half was in 1986!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Week.png))**\n\n&gt; Similar to the July 4th week, the day before July 4th has also historically been positive but not nearly to the same degree. On those days, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.04% with positive returns only slightly more than half of the time (54%). In years where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the day before July 4th is considerably better, averaging a gain of 0.17% with gains 64% of the time.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Day-Before.png))**\n\n&gt; With people out celebrating the July 4th holiday, the hangover sets in after. As shown below, the average S&amp;P 500 change on the trading day after July 4th is a decline of 0.18% with gains only 42% of the time. In years when the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the declines aren't as bad, but at -0.12% and gains only half of the time, they aren't positive either. This year the day after July 4th will also feature the June Non-Farm Payrolls report. That will be fun!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-July-4th-Day-After.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 6/28/19\n\n&gt; In posts yesterday and Monday, we made note of the increasingly disappointing economic data out of the US relative to expectations so far in 2019. This week's data only added to the woes as the Citi Economic Surprise Index for the US now sits only 0.73% above its April low.\n\n&gt; Over half of this week's releases came in worse than the prior period of estimates. The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index was the first release this week showing improvements from the April data and coming in above estimates, but the indicator is still showing contracting activity (reading below zero). The Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also was out on Monday showing far weaker results. Later in the week, on Thursday, the Kansas City Fed released their own manufacturing activity index completing our Five Fed Composite which is painting a bleak picture for the manufacturing sector. There was also a good amount of housing data this week with overall solid results including stronger than expected home prices (via the FHFA index and S&amp;P CoreLogic's Case-Shiller Index) but disappointing new home sales on Tuesday, improved MBA Mortgage Applications on Wednesday, and a much better Pending Home Sales print on Thursday. Chicago PMI dropped below 50 on Friday, which is a sign of contraction, but Michigan Confidence beat estimates. One other major release this week was the third and final release of quarterly GDP, which held steady at 3.1% QoQ but was below estimates of an increase to 3.2%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-Eco1.png))**\n\n&gt; Despite a shortened week due to the July 4th holiday, next week is set up to be a busy one. On Monday, Markit will release their final June PMI on manufacturing alongside the ISM reading later that morning. While Markit measures on manufacturing are expected to hold steady at 50.1, ISM data is anticipated to fall 1.1 down to 51. The only release Tuesday will be data on vehicle sales, which are expected to fall to 17 mm SAAR. On Thursday, there will be no releases and US markets will be shuttered in observance of the July 4th holiday. Additionally, markets will close early (1:00 PM EST) on Wednesday. In spite of this shortened session and day off, there is a huge slug of data to be released Wednesday. Following up the manufacturing PMIs, Markit and ISM non-manufacturing indicators are all due out on Wednesday. In the late morning, final May data on Factory, Durable, and Capital Goods Orders are also going to be released. Alongside the standard Wednesday release of MBA Mortgage Applications, other weekly data that is typically released on Thursday will be pushed ahead one day including Initial Jobless Claims and Bloomberg Consumer Comfort. ADP employment numbers are expected to show improvements when it releases on Wednesday ahead of Friday's Nonfarm payrolls report, which is also forecasting a solid improvement from the previous month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-Eco2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Trend Analyzer - 6/28/19 - Teetering On Overbought\n\n&gt; After the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) set a new all-time high last Thursday, stocks have yet to make a push back above these levels as all of the major index ETFs sit below where they were at last Thursday's close. This pullback was partially a function of the large-cap major index ETFs like the Russell 1000 (IWB) working off overbought levels. Whereas all of these were overbought last week, currently only the Dow (DIA) still sits in overbought territory although other large caps are teetering on joining DIA. The Core S&amp;P Small Cap (IJR) and Micro Cap (IWC) are only lower by 0.41% and 0.33%, respectively. These are smaller losses compared to other ETFs which lost around 1%. Ironically, this outperformance also comes as IJR and IWC are now showing sideways trends rather uptrends across the rest of the ETFs. Granted, not all small-cap indices have been outperforming. Another small-cap index, the Russell 2000 (IWM), has seen performance more inline with other ETFs, declining 1.07%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-TA.png))**\n\n&gt; Every sector except Materials (XLB) is lower over the last week. As shown in our Trend Analyzersnapshot below, it's the defensives that are finally lagging, with Real Estate (XLRE) down 4% and Utilities (XLU) down 2% since last Thursday's close. At the moment, only Materials and Health Care are overbought, while the rest are neutral.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062819-TA2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Falls to the Bottom of the Pack\n\n&gt; In a post earlier this week, we provided an update to the Citi Economic Surprise indices broken out by region. With economic data in the US continuing to disappoint this week, the Citi Surprise index (percentage of economic indicators that are beating vs. missing estimates) for the US is coming increasingly close to taking out its late April low and declining to its lowest levels in two years. What's also notable about the current reading is that at the most recent reading of -67.5, the surprise index for the US is more negative than any other country or region that this series tracks.\n\n&gt; Below we compare the Citi surprise reading for the US and Europe over the last twelve months, and what a reversal it has been. Heading into 2019, economic data in the US was coming in much better relative to expectations versus Europe, but ever since then, data in the US has been getting progressively worse relative to expectations, while data in Europe has been consistently improving.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/062719-Surprise.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# July’s First Trading Day—Most Bullish Day, S&amp;P 500 has Advanced 85.7% of the Time\n\n&gt; July’s first trading day is the best performing first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1,175.74 points since 1998. Over the past 21 years, DJIA’s first trading day of July has produced gains 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.40%. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 85.7% of the time (average gain 0.42%). NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 76.2% (0.26% average gain). No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 21 years.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/41bfded64b6be009498141e06d860cc6/tumblr_inline_ptt611r7Jm1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Pre-Election Year July Performance Mixed\n\n&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019).\n\n&gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the third weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and strength towards the end.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fd24fdadfeace7c60e914f3ebcfb44c/tumblr_inline_pts3qnHGqq1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Pre-election-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #6 for DJIA and #7 S&amp;P 500, averaging gains of 1.0% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979) pre-election Julys both rank #8. NASDAQ has only advanced in six of the last twelve pre-election Julys. Russell 2000 has advanced in five of its last ten. Despite tech’s and small-cap’s meager pre-election July track record, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have averaged gains of 0.9% and 0.3% respectively.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for June 28th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zivC-TiWAzAI))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 06.30.19** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csILGnJHs7A))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading month ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$AEMD** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$IRBT** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$YRD** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$ISCA** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$BMY** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$OMN** \n&gt; * **$GS**\n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$CNC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZFYkaOT.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/R5KvFNE.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/LA02AwI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.1.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/SNywSpDT/er7119am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.1.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/gcyCb0qL/er7119pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.2.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/tTN2wsQX/er7219am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.2.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.3.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/85NbRTFx/er7319am.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.3.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.4.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

I bought some $152.5 ITM calls for no real reason other than them being cheap on Friday as the stock dropped 1.27%. Obviously, I’m bullish only for the short term, They’re way to overbought. It’s pretty ridiculous for a fake meat company. I’m definitely gonna sell on Monday if I see any kind of profit (something not too common here), as I don't foresee a big rise this week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$REAL- ***BULLISH***\n\nThe stock jumped a whopping 44% the day it IPOed (Friday). Most people predicted this because of the founders previous IPO history. By the time we actually can trade options on this stock, I could turn bearish if the stock becomes too overbought, but for at least the next week, I'm bullish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$AAPL- ***BEARISH*** \n\nMy position on Apple is obviously mostly due to Jony Ive leaving the company and them moving production of the Mac Pro to out of the US. I currently have $2.5k in 210 ITM puts expiring on the 5th. I don't expect a big crash or anything so if I see some gains by mid-week or even mid-Monday I'm probably going to take it and run. At this point, the only reason I can think of for a possible rise in Apple stock would be due to the trade talks with China, as the tariffs would heavily affect Apple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$DIS- ***BULLISH***\n\nThe stock peaked this week at $141.18. I expect it to go down to at least $138 by mid-week mostly due to Toy Story 4 not doing as well as predicted. I currently have $7k in 135 ITM calls. I hope to sell on Wednesday’s open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$UBER- ***BEARISH*** \n\nThe stock went up 2.77% just Friday. The stock is too overpriced, and the company is way too overvalued for a company that for whatever reason doesn't seem to have a path to profitability. Overall, I’m bearish on this stock for both the short term and the long term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, only 6 stonks this week.

But I’m seeing a lot of people that want to make smart plays and/or join theta gang, and I think we have here a fantastic opportunity to make an easy 10% in three weeks. So if you’re looking for that, here we go with a good starting point. Again, not autistic, but a good play. \n\nIF you believe the following three premises, then I think you can easily make 10% in just three weeks. \n\n1. Trump and Xi will not come to a trade agreement this month. \n\n2. Earnings will generally be muted at best, and most likely straight up disappointing. \n\n3. The Fed will not cut interest rates this month unless the economy tanks. \n\nThe play: Sell solidly OTM call spreads on SPY. My personal favorite: 7/26 $302/$305 spreads.  I sold a bunch before close for $53/spread. The plan is to close for $23/spread for 10% gains ($30 on each $300 of collateral). \n\nDiscussion:\n\n1. Trump and Xi will not come to an agreement this month. We have yet to see anything from China that indicates they are willing to give ground on the fundamental issues. Meanwhile Trump keeps emphasizing that any deal must favor the US. China has made moves to become less reliant on the US in anticipation of extended tariffs. This recent truce involved no actual progress on key disagreements. Perhaps a deal is made eventually, but not soon. \n\n2. Earnings start ramping up this month. Most companies are toning down guidance and reporting that performance will decline year over year due to the effects of tariffs and slowed production. With no end in sight of the substantial tariffs, guidance will be low and expectations will be tempered. We aren’t going to see the types of earnings beats that cause stocks to push past ATHs. In addition, more and more articles will come out highlighting these facts over the next few weeks. \n\n3.  The Fed will not cut rates this month. The economy is still healthy. It’s not booming in the same way that it has been, but the primary goals of the fed are under control. Despite more dovish language at their last meeting, the Fed is still in a “wait and see” attitude about rate cuts and does not want to pull the trigger prematurely. If really bad economic data comes out, they could lower rates. But their dot plot actually shows very minor rate cuts before more rate hikes in the coming years. It would take a harsh economic downturn to force their hand (which would likely be fine for this play as well). If the economy tanks, selling calls is a good play. \n\nTherefore, I see no catalysts that can push us higher than the $297 area we could not push through on this weekend’s news. The market might not go down, because Trump is a master at propping it up, but there is no real reason to push through and blast through ATH without one of the three fundamental issues above changing. \n\nSo enter the spreads and relax for a month of slow burn gains- if you want to join theta gang or bear gang, this is your invitation.'), ('Can anyone please explain what in the fuck is going on with the S&amp;P', 'Can anyone please explain what in the fuck is going on with the S&amp;PWhat I want to have happen: consolidation AH, another rally in the morning to avenge neutered Bull run (SPY is currently shaky at 295)  \n\n\nWhat I think will happen: back down to 293 then 295 again for flat day'), ('Its AAPL.

I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 8th, 2019.\n\n# **The week ahead: Powell’s testimony could make or break the stock rally  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/05/the-week-ahead-powells-testimony-could-make-or-break-the-stock-rally.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has the opportunity to reinforce market expectations for a late July rate cut or rein them in when he speaks to Congress in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday and at the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, and is expected to answer questions on the economy and Fed policy.\n*****\n&gt; His testimony comes after a strong June jobs report raised questions about whether the Fed will actually cut rates this month. The U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs last month, easily topping a Dow Jones estimate of 165,000. The report sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield back above the key 2% level. The dollar also rallied against a basket of currencies, pressuring commodities like gold.\n*****\n&gt; The report was “stronger than expected, but with an accompanying -11k in revisions the job gains were nothing to derail the Fed’s anticipated cut in 26 days,” Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note. The Fed next decides on rates on July 31.\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, the market also has other places to look for clues on Fed policy, including in the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting, after which it suggested it could cut rates if it needs to. Those minutes are released Wednesday afternoon. There is also important consumer price index inflation data Thursday and producer level inflation data on Friday, when PPI is reported.\n*****\n&gt; But Powell’s comments to Congressional committees could clarify whether the Fed is on course to cut interest rates later this month, as widely expected.\n*****\n&gt; “It’s not clear to me the data are going to create a screaming case one way or the other. What it comes down to, is the Fed able to validate the market’s dovishness here?” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint. “The one thing that has characterized Fed communications over the last month or six weeks is they’re just not willing to commit to anything ahead of time.”\n*****\n&gt; Hopes for a rate cut have sent bond yields lower and supported stocks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit all-time highs. The tech sector rose more than 1% to a record as well, while the communications services sector surged more than 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say the markets would see a violent swing if Powell doesn’t stay on track for a rate cut. The fed funds futures market is pricing in one full quarter point rate cut and a little more for July.\n*****\n&gt; “I personally don’t see the case for an ease right now,” said Stanley. “Do they passively accept the market’s verdict or do they push back, in that they’re not fully on board with an ease right now? It would be easy to realign the market’s expectations. Powell speaks next week and that would be the perfect opportunity if they were so inclined.”\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said such a move would upset the stock market and weaken financial conditions, something the Fed would not want to do. But there is not a unanimous view about interest rate moves on the Fed either. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said this week that rates should be kept where they are for awhile. On the other hand, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard dissented at the June meeting because the Fed did not cut interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said a change in tone from Powell would be disruptive and unlikely. “There are other people trying to figure out what is the right thing to do right now, and there’s no easy answer,” said Swonk. “Jay Powell has made up his mind, and he doesn’t want to be on the wrong side of a recession.”\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter point at the end of the month. “All you need is uncertainty. You’ve got that. You need inflation running low. You got that. You need wages not accelerating rapidly. You’ve got that,” she said. “You’ve got all these things lining up.”\n*****\n&gt; Some economists expect a half point cut, but Swonk said that would be too much since the Fed does not really have a lot of ammunition, given that the fed funds rate range is 2.25 to 2.50%. “They want insurance, but they don’t want to give away the house,” she said.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, investors will begin to think second quarter earnings season in the week ahead. Pepsico is a big name releasing its report Tuesday, ahead of the flood of reports from banks and others in the following week.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jQonVtn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/m3N3lix.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L0bHHdi.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/CgMNsnt.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WBvJZYZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mmZbnC0.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TC7Fft0.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D4sORiR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for next month:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cgaHl9C.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO\'s for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R4UVHfY.png))**\n\n# **Friday\'s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9vA8idX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1TVLIHl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Jumbo First Half Gains Usually Continue After a Pause\n\n&gt; The market just put on its best first half performance for the Dow since 1999, the S&amp;P 500 since 1997 and NASDAQ since 2003 – and that’s a pretty decent omen that market will tack on additional gains. Performance below following first-half Dow and S&amp;P 500 gains greater than 7% and NASDAQ Composite gains greater than 10% shows a solid history of gains for the second half – after a tepid market action in Q3.\n\n&gt; Modest gains of about 1% continue into July, but gains little ground during the rest of Q3, which should come as no surprise given the infamous negative history of August and September. On average the market was unable to match first half gains during the second, though the across-the-board 7+% gains over from July to December is still solid. The Dow’s second half win ratio following jumbo gains like 2019 is a rather impressive 85.3% – S&amp;P’s win ration is 80.0%, NAS 73.9%. Full-year gains are virtual lock.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03798f3a59e96e715850d320de656a38/tumblr_inline_ptzkf9dPpp1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2357ff4a6353191f4a1175180f5a73b7/tumblr_inline_ptzkfk43391spdppr_500.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/35b5389f967e61f1fa8e449677e307aa/tumblr_inline_ptzkiw6g3s1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Sector Weightings: Mid-Year 2019\n\n&gt; Below is an updated snapshot of S&amp;P 500 sector weightings as of mid-year 2019. As shown, the Technology sector makes up the largest slice of the pie with a weighting of 21.48%. Health Care ranks as the second largest sector of the market at 14.20%, followed by Financials at 13.07%. The fact that technology and two service-oriented sectors making up nearly 50% of the index shows how much the US economy has shifted over the years. After the "big three" of Tech, Health Care, and Financials, we move down to Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, and Industrials, which are all right around 10%. Consumer Staples has a weighting of 7.27%, and Energy is all the way down to 5.05% after years of losing share. Utilities, Real Estate, and Materials combine to add up to roughly 9% of the index, so these three sectors are basically immaterial at this point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weightings.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a chart showing how much weightings changed in the first half of 2019. The Technology sector gained 1.33 percentage points while Health Care lost 1.23 percentage points, so the gap between the biggest sector (Tech) and the 2nd biggest sector (Health Care) widened by more than 2.5. Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Real Estate, Materials, and Communication Services all gained share in the first half as well, while Energy, Financials, Consumer Staples, and Utilities all lost share along with Health Care.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sector-weightings.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Most Heavily Shorted S&amp;P 500 Stocks\n\n&gt; Below is a list of the 29 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have more than 10% of their share float sold short. Luxury retailer Nordstrom (JWN) currently tops the list with 22% of its float sold short. The stock is down 33.86% YTD and 55% from levels seen last November.\n\n&gt; Tax-prep company H&amp;R Block (HRB) is the second most heavily shorted stock with 20.55% of its float sold short. HRB is followed by sports retailer Under Armour (UAA), Snap-On (SNA), and Kohl\'s (KSS). While JWN and KSS are both down big YTD, HRB, UAA, and SNA are all up nicely on the year.\n\n&gt; There are plenty of other notables on the list, including Macy\'s (M), Campbell Soup (CPB), TripAdvisor (TRIP), Gap (GPS), Western Union (WU), and Foot Locker (FL), but one common characteristic among many of them is that they are retailers.\n\n&gt; On average, these stocks with 10%+ short interest as a percentage of float are up 8.5% on the year, which is well below the 17% gain that the S&amp;P 500 has seen.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spx500.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we have input the list of heavily shorted stocks into a custom portfolio that Bespoke members can create when they\'re logged into our website. We\'ve sorted the list by our algo-driven "Trend" and "Timing" scores. There are currently four stocks on the list that are in Bespoke "uptrends" with "good" timing scores -- Under Armour (UAA), Intl Flavors &amp; Fragrances (IFF), Campbell Soup (CPB), and Coty (COTY).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/high-shorts-ta.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Yield Curve Craters\n\n&gt; With the 10-year plummeting below 2% again and the 3-month yield spiking up by over 7 basis points (bps), which is its biggest one day gain since December 2017, the yield curve is cratering today. Today\'s 11 bps move further into inverted territory is the biggest one-day move since January 2nd (see second chart). While not back at new lows, today marks the 29th day that the curve has now been inverted. In Fedspeak news, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester (who leans hawkish but isn\'t a voter) just noted in a speech that she\'s in no hurry to cut. She argues that "Cutting rates at this juncture could reinforce negative sentiment about a deterioration in the outlook even if this is not the baseline view, and could encourage financial imbalances given the current level of interest rates, which would be counterproductive."\n\n&gt; What would cause her to change her stance? “If I see a few weak job reports, further declines in manufacturing activity, indicators pointing to weaker business investment and consumption, and declines in readings of longer-term inflation expectations, I would view this as evidence that the base case is shifting to the weak-growth scenario.” A few weak job reports? In other words, she is in no hurry to take any action. Keep in mind, though, that as recently as late February, Mester was still of the view that the FOMC would need to be raising rates later on this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070219-Yield-Curve.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Happy Birthday, And Another Record Goes Down\n\n&gt; “If you’re looking for something to discuss at your barbecue while watching fireworks, be sure to mention this is now the oldest economic cycle in history at 121 months old,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. That’s right, this cycle just topped the previous record of 120 months from the 1990s technology boom.\n\n&gt; Although 10 years might sound old, keep in mind that developed markets tend to have longer cycles of economic growth. “Is 10 years really that old for an expansion? Maybe not, as Australia hasn’t had a recession for nearly 28 years,” according to Detrick. “Not to mention Canada, the U.K., Spain, and Sweden, which all have had at least 15 years of growth starting in the early 1990s and ending in 2008. Going even further back we see that France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Ireland, and China have all had at least 15-year-plus expansions since World War II.”\n\n&gt; Emerging countries tend to see more of a boom-and-bust type of cycle while more developed nations can have longer-lasting periods of growth. In fact, it’s plausible that the United States could have avoided a recession in 2001 if the 9/11 attacks had not happened, which would have produced a nearly 17-year expansion. So maybe 10 years isn’t so old?\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day, This Is Now The Longest Expansion Ever, shows, this is now the longest expansion ever. Additionally, over the decades as the United States turned into a developed nation, the cycles of growth tended to last longer. Thanks to the dual benefits of fiscal and monetary policy, we continue to expect this current cycle to have potentially years of growth left.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/826zZSV.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending July 5th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 07.7.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUYuuW6kYVE))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in July-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$AEMD** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$IRBT** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$YRD** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$ISCA** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$BMY** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$OMN** \n&gt; * **$GS**\n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$CNC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK\'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/xmzSnnx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK\'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NNrT29C.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Sy9VT1Z.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.8.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ses5tRb.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.8.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.9.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eQP0M9U.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.9.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ePT21m9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.10.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/YYKTKJK.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.10.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WwTFpZ9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.11.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gwEMWHy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.11.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.12.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yv5qORt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.12.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kraft Heinz Company $31.04 \n&gt; **Kraft Heinz Company (KHC)** is expected to report earnings at approximately 5:00 PM ET on Wednesday, July 31, 2019.

The U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs last month, easily topping a Dow Jones estimate of 165,000. The report sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield back above the key 2% level. The dollar also rallied against a basket of currencies, pressuring commodities like gold.\n*****\n&gt; The report was “stronger than expected, but with an accompanying -11k in revisions the job gains were nothing to derail the Fed’s anticipated cut in 26 days,” Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note. The Fed next decides on rates on July 31.\n*****\n&gt; In the coming week, the market also has other places to look for clues on Fed policy, including in the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting, after which it suggested it could cut rates if it needs to. Those minutes are released Wednesday afternoon. There is also important consumer price index inflation data Thursday and producer level inflation data on Friday, when PPI is reported.\n*****\n&gt; But Powell’s comments to Congressional committees could clarify whether the Fed is on course to cut interest rates later this month, as widely expected.\n*****\n&gt; “It’s not clear to me the data are going to create a screaming case one way or the other. What it comes down to, is the Fed able to validate the market’s dovishness here?” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint. “The one thing that has characterized Fed communications over the last month or six weeks is they’re just not willing to commit to anything ahead of time.”\n*****\n&gt; Hopes for a rate cut have sent bond yields lower and supported stocks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit all-time highs. The tech sector rose more than 1% to a record as well, while the communications services sector surged more than 2%.\n*****\n&gt; Economists say the markets would see a violent swing if Powell doesn’t stay on track for a rate cut. The fed funds futures market is pricing in one full quarter point rate cut and a little more for July.\n*****\n&gt; “I personally don’t see the case for an ease right now,” said Stanley. “Do they passively accept the market’s verdict or do they push back, in that they’re not fully on board with an ease right now? It would be easy to realign the market’s expectations. Powell speaks next week and that would be the perfect opportunity if they were so inclined.”\n*****\n&gt; Stanley said such a move would upset the stock market and weaken financial conditions, something the Fed would not want to do. But there is not a unanimous view about interest rate moves on the Fed either. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said this week that rates should be kept where they are for awhile. On the other hand, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard dissented at the June meeting because the Fed did not cut interest rates.\n*****\n&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said a change in tone from Powell would be disruptive and unlikely. “There are other people trying to figure out what is the right thing to do right now, and there’s no easy answer,” said Swonk. “Jay Powell has made up his mind, and he doesn’t want to be on the wrong side of a recession.”\n*****\n&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter point at the end of the month. “All you need is uncertainty. You’ve got that. You need inflation running low. You got that. You need wages not accelerating rapidly. You’ve got that,” she said. “You’ve got all these things lining up.”\n*****\n&gt; Some economists expect a half point cut, but Swonk said that would be too much since the Fed does not really have a lot of ammunition, given that the fed funds rate range is 2.25 to 2.50%. “They want insurance, but they don’t want to give away the house,” she said.\n*****\n&gt; Besides the Fed, investors will begin to think second quarter earnings season in the week ahead. Pepsico is a big name releasing its report Tuesday, ahead of the flood of reports from banks and others in the following week.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jQonVtn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/m3N3lix.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/L0bHHdi.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/CgMNsnt.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WBvJZYZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mmZbnC0.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TC7Fft0.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/D4sORiR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for next month:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cgaHl9C.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO\'s for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R4UVHfY.png))**\n\n# **Friday\'s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/9vA8idX.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/1TVLIHl.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Jumbo First Half Gains Usually Continue After a Pause\n\n&gt; The market just put on its best first half performance for the Dow since 1999, the S&amp;P 500 since 1997 and NASDAQ since 2003 – and that’s a pretty decent omen that market will tack on additional gains. Performance below following first-half Dow and S&amp;P 500 gains greater than 7% and NASDAQ Composite gains greater than 10% shows a solid history of gains for the second half – after a tepid market action in Q3.\n\n&gt; Modest gains of about 1% continue into July, but gains little ground during the rest of Q3, which should come as no surprise given the infamous negative history of August and September. On average the market was unable to match first half gains during the second, though the across-the-board 7+% gains over from July to December is still solid. The Dow’s second half win ratio following jumbo gains like 2019 is a rather impressive 85.3% – S&amp;P’s win ration is 80.0%, NAS 73.9%. Full-year gains are virtual lock.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/03798f3a59e96e715850d320de656a38/tumblr_inline_ptzkf9dPpp1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/2357ff4a6353191f4a1175180f5a73b7/tumblr_inline_ptzkfk43391spdppr_500.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/35b5389f967e61f1fa8e449677e307aa/tumblr_inline_ptzkiw6g3s1spdppr_500.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Sector Weightings: Mid-Year 2019\n\n&gt; Below is an updated snapshot of S&amp;P 500 sector weightings as of mid-year 2019. As shown, the Technology sector makes up the largest slice of the pie with a weighting of 21.48%. Health Care ranks as the second largest sector of the market at 14.20%, followed by Financials at 13.07%. The fact that technology and two service-oriented sectors making up nearly 50% of the index shows how much the US economy has shifted over the years. After the "big three" of Tech, Health Care, and Financials, we move down to Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, and Industrials, which are all right around 10%. Consumer Staples has a weighting of 7.27%, and Energy is all the way down to 5.05% after years of losing share. Utilities, Real Estate, and Materials combine to add up to roughly 9% of the index, so these three sectors are basically immaterial at this point.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/weightings.png))**\n\n&gt; Below is a chart showing how much weightings changed in the first half of 2019. The Technology sector gained 1.33 percentage points while Health Care lost 1.23 percentage points, so the gap between the biggest sector (Tech) and the 2nd biggest sector (Health Care) widened by more than 2.5. Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Real Estate, Materials, and Communication Services all gained share in the first half as well, while Energy, Financials, Consumer Staples, and Utilities all lost share along with Health Care.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sector-weightings.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Most Heavily Shorted S&amp;P 500 Stocks\n\n&gt; Below is a list of the 29 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have more than 10% of their share float sold short. Luxury retailer Nordstrom (JWN) currently tops the list with 22% of its float sold short. The stock is down 33.86% YTD and 55% from levels seen last November.\n\n&gt; Tax-prep company H&amp;R Block (HRB) is the second most heavily shorted stock with 20.55% of its float sold short. HRB is followed by sports retailer Under Armour (UAA), Snap-On (SNA), and Kohl\'s (KSS). While JWN and KSS are both down big YTD, HRB, UAA, and SNA are all up nicely on the year.\n\n&gt; There are plenty of other notables on the list, including Macy\'s (M), Campbell Soup (CPB), TripAdvisor (TRIP), Gap (GPS), Western Union (WU), and Foot Locker (FL), but one common characteristic among many of them is that they are retailers.\n\n&gt; On average, these stocks with 10%+ short interest as a percentage of float are up 8.5% on the year, which is well below the 17% gain that the S&amp;P 500 has seen.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/spx500.png))**\n\n&gt; Below we have input the list of heavily shorted stocks into a custom portfolio that Bespoke members can create when they\'re logged into our website.

Today\'s 11 bps move further into inverted territory is the biggest one-day move since January 2nd (see second chart). While not back at new lows, today marks the 29th day that the curve has now been inverted. In Fedspeak news, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester (who leans hawkish but isn\'t a voter) just noted in a speech that she\'s in no hurry to cut. She argues that "Cutting rates at this juncture could reinforce negative sentiment about a deterioration in the outlook even if this is not the baseline view, and could encourage financial imbalances given the current level of interest rates, which would be counterproductive."\n\n&gt; What would cause her to change her stance? “If I see a few weak job reports, further declines in manufacturing activity, indicators pointing to weaker business investment and consumption, and declines in readings of longer-term inflation expectations, I would view this as evidence that the base case is shifting to the weak-growth scenario.” A few weak job reports? In other words, she is in no hurry to take any action. Keep in mind, though, that as recently as late February, Mester was still of the view that the FOMC would need to be raising rates later on this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070219-Yield-Curve.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Happy Birthday, And Another Record Goes Down\n\n&gt; “If you’re looking for something to discuss at your barbecue while watching fireworks, be sure to mention this is now the oldest economic cycle in history at 121 months old,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. That’s right, this cycle just topped the previous record of 120 months from the 1990s technology boom.\n\n&gt; Although 10 years might sound old, keep in mind that developed markets tend to have longer cycles of economic growth. “Is 10 years really that old for an expansion? Maybe not, as Australia hasn’t had a recession for nearly 28 years,” according to Detrick. “Not to mention Canada, the U.K., Spain, and Sweden, which all have had at least 15 years of growth starting in the early 1990s and ending in 2008. Going even further back we see that France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Ireland, and China have all had at least 15-year-plus expansions since World War II.”\n\n&gt; Emerging countries tend to see more of a boom-and-bust type of cycle while more developed nations can have longer-lasting periods of growth. In fact, it’s plausible that the United States could have avoided a recession in 2001 if the 9/11 attacks had not happened, which would have produced a nearly 17-year expansion. So maybe 10 years isn’t so old?\n\n&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day, This Is Now The Longest Expansion Ever, shows, this is now the longest expansion ever. Additionally, over the decades as the United States turned into a developed nation, the cycles of growth tended to last longer. Thanks to the dual benefits of fiscal and monetary policy, we continue to expect this current cycle to have potentially years of growth left.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/826zZSV.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending July 5th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 07.7.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUYuuW6kYVE))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in July-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$NFLX** \n&gt; * **$BA** \n&gt; * **$F** \n&gt; * **$UNH** \n&gt; * **$INTC** \n&gt; * **$T** \n&gt; * **$CLF** \n&gt; * **$BAC** \n&gt; * **$PEP** \n&gt; * **$GOOGL** \n&gt; * **$AEMD** \n&gt; * **$DAL** \n&gt; * **$JPM** \n&gt; * **$C** \n&gt; * **$SMPL** \n&gt; * **$HAL** \n&gt; * **$WFC** \n&gt; * **$IRBT** \n&gt; * **$AYI** \n&gt; * **$JNJ** \n&gt; * **$MMM** \n&gt; * **$BBBY** \n&gt; * **$YRD** \n&gt; * **$NOK** \n&gt; * **$ISCA** \n&gt; * **$CAT** \n&gt; * **$CMG** \n&gt; * **$ISRG** \n&gt; * **$KO** \n&gt; * **$MA** \n&gt; * **$LEVI** \n&gt; * **$BMY** \n&gt; * **$SLB** \n&gt; * **$INFY** \n&gt; * **$OMN** \n&gt; * **$GS**\n&gt; * **$CSX** \n&gt; * **$PGR** \n&gt; * **$UPS** \n&gt; * **$ERIC** \n&gt; * **$ABT** \n&gt; * **$AA** \n&gt; * **$CNC**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK\'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/xmzSnnx.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK\'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/NNrT29C.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/Sy9VT1Z.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.8.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ses5tRb.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 7.8.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.9.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eQP0M9U.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Tuesday 7.9.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ePT21m9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.10.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/YYKTKJK.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Wednesday 7.10.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WwTFpZ9.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.11.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gwEMWHy.png))\n\n&gt; # ***Thursday 7.11.19 After Market Close:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.12.19 Before Market Open:*** \n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/yv5qORt.png))\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Friday 7.12.19 After Market Close:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Kraft Heinz Company $31.04 \n&gt; **Kraft Heinz Company (KHC)** is expected to report earnings at approximately 5:00 PM ET on Wednesday, July 31, 2019.

We all like getting more of it, and [some of us really enjoy giving it all away](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cdx7y5/shoutout_to_jnj_calls_for_being_the_final_nail_in/). Fortunately for the latter this will make your portfolio shoot wildly in different directions before you finally rocket up to the big pie in the sky. This is a plan so wild [it actually made Bogleheads users excited for once in their lives](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007).\n\nNow if the pussies at r/investing had their way you'd plop 50% of your paycheck into some low-cost, broad-market, diversified artistanal GMO-free fair trade certified index fund and you'd keep doing that until you turn 78, at which point you open your portfolio, sell everything for ONE MILLION DOLLARS and use it to pay your hospital bills with maybe enough left to break up the surviving members of your family over your inheritance.\n\nI won't give you a yacht tomorrow but on average with this strategy, you can make in two years what they can make in one. Which means more money to peel off from this fund into whatever options/shady Chinese tech stocks you care to buy. *And that's why I'm posting this here*.\n\nNow Mr. Shkreli always said the secret to riches is to use other people's money. And fortunately my good friends at ProShares (and their slightly gayer cousins over at Direxion, proud owners of [THE NUG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/jnug?ltr=1)) will give you some of other people's money to invest. These are called *3x* funds and are understood by pretty much nobody.\n\nThe way they work is something like this: You have $10,000. You go to your good friend and ask him for $20,000. You take that money and put it into $SPY (or whatever the fund tracks) when the market opens. Then when the market closes you sell all your shares and give your friend back his 20 grand, plus a little interest for being such a good, trusting friend (currently, 1% a year). Now tomorrow, you can repeat the same trick, but if you now have $10,300 after paying your friend, he'll give you $20,600 because you know what you're doing. If you only have $9,700, he'll only give you $19,400 because you don't know what you're doing. However much you have in the morning, you'll get double from your good friend, and all he asks is that little bit of interest. This is called *leverage*, and in our case, it *resets daily*.\n\nIn our case, we want two good friends. One of them is a fund called **UPRO** which just like my example tracks the S&amp;P 500 and gives you 3x daily leverage. The other one is called **TMF** which leverages long-term treasuries ($TLT). TLT works by buying treasury bonds of about 20 years and selling slightly older treasury bonds of the same maturity. The retard's explanation is: when rates go up, TLT goes down, when rates go down, TLT goes up, and when rates stay the same, you make that 2% or whatever the 20-year rate is. TMF is your good friend who will help you buy TLT until it stops being boring.\n\n**But the SEC, Vanguard, r/investing, Morningstar, and my dad's financial advisor told me these funds will all go to 0!** First off, why the fuck are you here? But second off, they've a right to be worried, because if you read this far, thought treasuries are boring, and just went balls-deep into UPRO, [**you could lose 97.5% of all your money** (look at the y-axis)](https://i.imgur.com/xMypC66.png). However while a lot of 3x funds will go to 0 over time due to volatility issues and expense ratios, these two *won't*. Because their underlyings, stonks and treasuries, rise faster than their expense ratio eat away at your gainz. A LOT faster in the case of stock. In fact, *both UPRO and TMF pay dividends* (like a few pennies a share, but still).\n\nI just mentioned volatility issues, what are those? A lot of people on Reddit will tell you, if you bring up UPRO or TQQQ, that these are bad because if SPY goes up 1% and then goes down 1%, you lose a little money, and since UPRO goes up 3 and down 3, you lose more than triple the money. They're not wrong, but that's not the only thing that can happen, and if you actually took their dumb example and did a little bit of shitty probability theory, you'd actually find out you make more than 3 times the underlying: https://pastebin.com/zFFDr7fq. Not guaranteeing that you'll actually 3x the fund though. You could also lose 97.5% of it. But read on and I'll explain how you can double your annual returns. Which adds up to a lot more money than anything else you can do by pushing a single button every month.\n\n**I hate math, just tell me what to do**. I can't tell you what to do but I'll tell you what I'm going to do. For the smoothest ride possible, I want the volatilities to match. To do that, I take my money, **I put 40% of it into UPRO, and the other 60% into TMF, and come back once a month to rebalance it back to that percentage.** The rebalance is key to avoiding that horror story with the 97.5% loss. The long and short of it is, *UPRO and TMF have zero to slightly negative correlation*. If there's a crash and UPRO takes a dump, Treasuries will barely notice, so I'll sell my perfectly good or maybe slightly inflated TMF on my rebalancing day, load up on cheap UPRO, and when the market inevitably recovers, UPRO shoots back up at lightspeed and suddenly more money appears in my pocket. You don't have to do once a month either. You can do every 3 months, or more frequently if you don't mind paying cap gains on all the sales you inevitably make/rebalance via a steady source of income.\n\n**How much do I make?** If you put 100k and nothing else into this fund in 1987, and we pretend both these funds existed pre-2009 with the same rules, [14 million](https://i.imgur.com/Wj1FEIi.png) vs 2 million with 100% stocks. It would've been a bumpy ride up, but note that you'd actually never experience a 50% loss on your investment, ever, which can't be said for people holding 100% stocks.\n\n**That sucks, why did you make me read this?** Because it's lazy and still semi-responsible. However there's a few things you can do if you want to milk more returns:\n* **Go 60% UPRO/40% TMF**. You'll potentially lose more on the way down (66% max drawdown, but that's nothing by WSB standards), but you'll make it all back on the way up, plus an extra percent or so.\n* **Sub out UPRO for TQQQ**. The Nasdaq will make you more money, and then the dot com bubble will burst and you'll lose it all. So try not to do this when that happens.\n* **Use FUTURES to up the leverage!** [I don't know what the fuck this guy did](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4636048#p4636048) but he said 8x leverage and 8 is more than 3! Pros are you get to trade in the future and you get more money which is pretty cool. Cons are the futures might go against you overnight and your broker will nuke your portfolio to cover the cost. Your good friends at ProShares would never do that to you.\n\n**Is this risk-free money?** ~~Yes~~ No. If the market crashes AND rates go up significantly/inflation happens, your portfolio will be in a deep hole. Luckily the Fed is pretty transparent in current year, and post-Volcker they've gotten a handle on not doing funny business with rates. Europe and Japan are close to 0 on long term treasuries and negative in the short term, so we CAN in fact get lower (and TMF will get richer).\n\nProShares can also shut its doors but these are ETF's, not ETN's, which means they won't fuck you out of your money like Credit Suisse did during the Vixpocalypse last year.\n\n**But if inflation happens?** Sounds gay, but okay. Add some gold in there. Except don't be a pussy, be sure to 3x it. Try [UGLD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UGLD/)\n\n**TL;DR** This (and its variations like TQQQ/TMF) is probably the most ballsy buy-and-hold that still actually makes money and makes a lot of it. Make sure to rebalance or you'll lose half your money.\n\nPros:\n* You'll make more money if you're bad at options\n* Boomers will hate you\n* Thanks to TMF your Robinhood account will be different colors every day with zero correlation to what the rest of the market is doing\n* You'll actually get to watch a stock split when UPRO does it again (last split: May 2018)\n\nCons:\n* You'll make less money if you're good at options\n* You actually have to pay attention to what interest rates are doing (Hi, Jerome)\n* The market will have a run and you'll still be down for the day because TMF took a dump"), ('MRW I go all in on the MSFT dip pre-ER and it drops -.1% then stays flat', 'MRW I go all in on the MSFT dip pre-ER and it drops -.1% then stays flat'), ('Hey MSFT, fuck you', 'Hey MSFT, fuck youYou were supposed to destroy the red, not join them'), ('A luxury cologne for after TSLA hits $420', 'A luxury cologne for after TSLA hits $420'), ('Last of my money on Netflix earnings.

Which means more money to peel off from this fund into whatever options/shady Chinese tech stocks you care to buy. *And that's why I'm posting this here*.\n\nNow Mr. Shkreli always said the secret to riches is to use other people's money. And fortunately my good friends at ProShares (and their slightly gayer cousins over at Direxion, proud owners of [THE NUG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/jnug?ltr=1)) will give you some of other people's money to invest. These are called *3x* funds and are understood by pretty much nobody.\n\nThe way they work is something like this: You have $10,000. You go to your good friend and ask him for $20,000. You take that money and put it into $SPY (or whatever the fund tracks) when the market opens. Then when the market closes you sell all your shares and give your friend back his 20 grand, plus a little interest for being such a good, trusting friend (currently, 1% a year). Now tomorrow, you can repeat the same trick, but if you now have $10,300 after paying your friend, he'll give you $20,600 because you know what you're doing. If you only have $9,700, he'll only give you $19,400 because you don't know what you're doing. However much you have in the morning, you'll get double from your good friend, and all he asks is that little bit of interest. This is called *leverage*, and in our case, it *resets daily*.\n\nIn our case, we want two good friends. One of them is a fund called **UPRO** which just like my example tracks the S&amp;P 500 and gives you 3x daily leverage. The other one is called **TMF** which leverages long-term treasuries ($TLT). TLT works by buying treasury bonds of about 20 years and selling slightly older treasury bonds of the same maturity. The retard's explanation is: when rates go up, TLT goes down, when rates go down, TLT goes up, and when rates stay the same, you make that 2% or whatever the 20-year rate is. TMF is your good friend who will help you buy TLT until it stops being boring.\n\n**But the SEC, Vanguard, r/investing, Morningstar, and my dad's financial advisor told me these funds will all go to 0!** First off, why the fuck are you here? But second off, they've a right to be worried, because if you read this far, thought treasuries are boring, and just went balls-deep into UPRO, [**you could lose 97.5% of all your money** (look at the y-axis)](https://i.imgur.com/xMypC66.png). However while a lot of 3x funds will go to 0 over time due to volatility issues and expense ratios, these two *won't*. Because their underlyings, stonks and treasuries, rise faster than their expense ratio eat away at your gainz. A LOT faster in the case of stock. In fact, *both UPRO and TMF pay dividends* (like a few pennies a share, but still).\n\nI just mentioned volatility issues, what are those? A lot of people on Reddit will tell you, if you bring up UPRO or TQQQ, that these are bad because if SPY goes up 1% and then goes down 1%, you lose a little money, and since UPRO goes up 3 and down 3, you lose more than triple the money. They're not wrong, but that's not the only thing that can happen, and if you actually took their dumb example and did a little bit of shitty probability theory, you'd actually find out you make more than 3 times the underlying: https://pastebin.com/zFFDr7fq. Not guaranteeing that you'll actually 3x the fund though. You could also lose 97.5% of it. But read on and I'll explain how you can double your annual returns. Which adds up to a lot more money than anything else you can do by pushing a single button every month.\n\n**I hate math, just tell me what to do**. I can't tell you what to do but I'll tell you what I'm going to do. For the smoothest ride possible, I want the volatilities to match. To do that, I take my money, **I put 40% of it into UPRO, and the other 60% into TMF, and come back once a month to rebalance it back to that percentage.** The rebalance is key to avoiding that horror story with the 97.5% loss. The long and short of it is, *UPRO and TMF have zero to slightly negative correlation*. If there's a crash and UPRO takes a dump, Treasuries will barely notice, so I'll sell my perfectly good or maybe slightly inflated TMF on my rebalancing day, load up on cheap UPRO, and when the market inevitably recovers, UPRO shoots back up at lightspeed and suddenly more money appears in my pocket. You don't have to do once a month either. You can do every 3 months, or more frequently if you don't mind paying cap gains on all the sales you inevitably make/rebalance via a steady source of income.\n\n**How much do I make?** If you put 100k and nothing else into this fund in 1987, and we pretend both these funds existed pre-2009 with the same rules, [14 million](https://i.imgur.com/Wj1FEIi.png) vs 2 million with 100% stocks. It would've been a bumpy ride up, but note that you'd actually never experience a 50% loss on your investment, ever, which can't be said for people holding 100% stocks.\n\n**That sucks, why did you make me read this?** Because it's lazy and still semi-responsible. However there's a few things you can do if you want to milk more returns:\n* **Go 60% UPRO/40% TMF**. You'll potentially lose more on the way down (66% max drawdown, but that's nothing by WSB standards), but you'll make it all back on the way up, plus an extra percent or so.\n* **Sub out UPRO for TQQQ**. The Nasdaq will make you more money, and then the dot com bubble will burst and you'll lose it all. So try not to do this when that happens.\n* **Use FUTURES to up the leverage!** [I don't know what the fuck this guy did](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4636048#p4636048) but he said 8x leverage and 8 is more than 3! Pros are you get to trade in the future and you get more money which is pretty cool. Cons are the futures might go against you overnight and your broker will nuke your portfolio to cover the cost. Your good friends at ProShares would never do that to you.\n\n**Is this risk-free money?** ~~Yes~~ No. If the market crashes AND rates go up significantly/inflation happens, your portfolio will be in a deep hole. Luckily the Fed is pretty transparent in current year, and post-Volcker they've gotten a handle on not doing funny business with rates. Europe and Japan are close to 0 on long term treasuries and negative in the short term, so we CAN in fact get lower (and TMF will get richer).\n\nProShares can also shut its doors but these are ETF's, not ETN's, which means they won't fuck you out of your money like Credit Suisse did during the Vixpocalypse last year.\n\n**But if inflation happens?** Sounds gay, but okay.

I can't tell you what to do but I'll tell you what I'm going to do. For the smoothest ride possible, I want the volatilities to match. To do that, I take my money, **I put 40% of it into UPRO, and the other 60% into TMF, and come back once a month to rebalance it back to that percentage.** The rebalance is key to avoiding that horror story with the 97.5% loss. The long and short of it is, *UPRO and TMF have zero to slightly negative correlation*. If there's a crash and UPRO takes a dump, Treasuries will barely notice, so I'll sell my perfectly good or maybe slightly inflated TMF on my rebalancing day, load up on cheap UPRO, and when the market inevitably recovers, UPRO shoots back up at lightspeed and suddenly more money appears in my pocket. You don't have to do once a month either. You can do every 3 months, or more frequently if you don't mind paying cap gains on all the sales you inevitably make/rebalance via a steady source of income.\n\n**How much do I make?** If you put 100k and nothing else into this fund in 1987, and we pretend both these funds existed pre-2009 with the same rules, [14 million](https://i.imgur.com/Wj1FEIi.png) vs 2 million with 100% stocks. It would've been a bumpy ride up, but note that you'd actually never experience a 50% loss on your investment, ever, which can't be said for people holding 100% stocks.\n\n**That sucks, why did you make me read this?** Because it's lazy and still semi-responsible. However there's a few things you can do if you want to milk more returns:\n* **Go 60% UPRO/40% TMF**. You'll potentially lose more on the way down (66% max drawdown, but that's nothing by WSB standards), but you'll make it all back on the way up, plus an extra percent or so.\n* **Sub out UPRO for TQQQ**. The Nasdaq will make you more money, and then the dot com bubble will burst and you'll lose it all. So try not to do this when that happens.\n* **Use FUTURES to up the leverage!** [I don't know what the fuck this guy did](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=4636048#p4636048) but he said 8x leverage and 8 is more than 3! Pros are you get to trade in the future and you get more money which is pretty cool. Cons are the futures might go against you overnight and your broker will nuke your portfolio to cover the cost. Your good friends at ProShares would never do that to you.\n\n**Is this risk-free money?** ~~Yes~~ No. If the market crashes AND rates go up significantly/inflation happens, your portfolio will be in a deep hole. Luckily the Fed is pretty transparent in current year, and post-Volcker they've gotten a handle on not doing funny business with rates. Europe and Japan are close to 0 on long term treasuries and negative in the short term, so we CAN in fact get lower (and TMF will get richer).\n\nProShares can also shut its doors but these are ETF's, not ETN's, which means they won't fuck you out of your money like Credit Suisse did during the Vixpocalypse last year.\n\n**But if inflation happens?** Sounds gay, but okay. Add some gold in there. Except don't be a pussy, be sure to 3x it. Try [UGLD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UGLD/)\n\n**TL;DR** This (and its variations like TQQQ/TMF) is probably the most ballsy buy-and-hold that still actually makes money and makes a lot of it. Make sure to rebalance or you'll lose half your money.\n\nPros:\n* You'll make more money if you're bad at options\n* Boomers will hate you\n* Thanks to TMF your Robinhood account will be different colors every day with zero correlation to what the rest of the market is doing\n* You'll actually get to watch a stock split when UPRO does it again (last split: May 2018)\n\nCons:\n* You'll make less money if you're good at options\n* You actually have to pay attention to what interest rates are doing (Hi, Jerome)\n* The market will have a run and you'll still be down for the day because TMF took a dump"), ('Me, WSB, and $TSLA over the past three months.

Usually it’s a combination of both. \n\nWith Netflix, do we have either? It seems that Netflix has such a high spending budget because it invests in original content and licenses other shows. But unlike companies that invest in infrastructure and equipment, if Netflix wants to stay relevant, it must continue to do these things. It would be decades before Netflix has enough original content to get rid of the other stuff, and I’m not convinced it would be as popular without it.\n\nIn addition, do we really see massive growth from here? It seems that most people who want Netflix have Netflix, hence the drop in domestic growth, and that it just doesn’t have the same appeal internationally (hence the disappointing numbers).

FDs are a great way to lose money, don’t get me wrong, but you can do better.\n\nI’m here to help you.\n\nDisclaimer, I don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about, but neither does anyone else here so what’re you gonna do?\n\nFirst things first: why the fuck do you even care?  Spreads are cool in a couple of ways.  You know exactly what you’re betting and exactly what you stand to gain.  You can trade shit that you normally wouldn’t be able to touch outside of FDs.  And you can tell your friends (lmao) you have Level 3 Options, which no one gives a shit about.\n\nSound good?\n\nSecond things second: what the fuck is a spread even?  Bull put spreads and bear call spreads and whale shit spreads and what the fuck does any of that even mean?  Don’t worry, I got you.\n\nA spread is just buying one option and selling another one for the same shit.  You sell $TSLA 420c and buy $TSLA 425c, you just opened up a spread.  In this case, it’s a Call Credit Spread.\n\nBut let’s break that shit down.\n\nIt’s a call spread because you bought and sold calls.  Fucking duh.  It’s a *credit* spread because the price of the lower-strike call is lower than the price of the higher-strike call.  If you sell something for $10 and you buy something for $5, you make a net *credit* of $5.\n\nYou could do it the other way: you could buy $420 calls and sell $425 calls.  Now, since you’re buying something more expensive than the thing you’re selling, you have a net *debit*.  You’re spending money up front.  So this would be a call debit spread.\n\nSame shit with puts: you sell a put with a high strike (more $$$) and buy a put with a lower strike (less $), you make a net *credit* (put credit spread), and if you reverse that it’s a put debit spread.\n\nI know you’re not following so read it again.\n\nDone?  Let’s move on.\n\nSo you get what it *is*, but what’s the *point*?  Let’s say you’ve got $100 from that birthday card your grammy sent you and you wanna fuck with $MSFT going into earnings.  Fuck are you gonna do?\n\nLet’s say you’re not an idiot and you fucking *know* it’s gonna go up — but you don’t know how much.  You could buy deep OTM FDs and hope it moons (fucking idiot), or you can trade a spread.  Let’s say you go with the spread: you’ve got two potential plays.\n\nFirst, you can do a call debit spread.  You buy a call ATM or slightly OTM, then sell another call that’s slightly higher in strike — you’re using the money from the sale of a contract for stocks you don’t have to buy the call that you can’t fucking afford.  You just have to cover the $100 *difference*.\n\nWhy would a broker let you do this?  If the price moons and the call you *sold* gets exercised, you can exercise (by which I mean “your broker will exercise”) the call you *bought* to cover your ass.\n\nBut let’s say that’s just a bit too punk rock for you.\n\nYou have another play: you know it’s gonna go up, so you sell a put.  Your broke ass can’t afford to buy the shares if the shit tanks, though, so what’re you gonna do?  You’re gonna *buy* a put with a lower strike price (cheaper).  So, right off the bat, you make a couple bucks, and if the shit drills?  You bought another put, so you’re covered if you get exercised on.\n\nBeauty about credit spreads is that you can be wrong and still make money, as long as you’re not *too* wrong.\n\n$YOLO is trading at $300 going into earnings, and you wanna make a play.  You have a hundred bucks.  You think it’s gonna drop because it’s been *months* since $YOLO CEO called someone a pedo on Twitter, so you wanna short it.  What’s your play?\n\nYou go call credit spreads.  You sell calls at $300 for fifty cents a pop, and buy calls at $301 for thirty cents a share.  $20 goes right in your pocket, and you’re liable to cover exactly $100 in losses if everything goes tits up.\n\nTurns out you’re a retard and instead of drilling, $YOLO goes up ten cents a share.  $300.10, boys.  Now your guy’s exercising those $300 contracts you sold like “gimme my ten bucks ya bitch” but you’re good.  Your broker buys them at $300.10, sells at $300, and you pay the ten bucks for your fuck up.\n\nYou still have ten bucks from that $20 you pocketed at the beginning.  You were *wrong* and you made money.\n\nThis is perfect for you, because you’re gonna be wrong a lot.\n\nLet’s say you’re *really* wrong, though.  $YOLO CEO calls the entire country of America a bunch of mouthbreathing titfuckers during the earnings call, and shit goes to $400.  Now instead of coming after you for ten bucks, ya boy’s exercising like “but where’s my ten thousand, hoe ass hoe?”\n\nYou only have a hundred bucks, but you’re good.  You’re gonna exercise that $301 contract you *bought* like “where’s my $9900, bitch?”, then you only have to pay the $100 difference.\n\nYou *still* keep your twenty bucks from the sale.\n\nNow you’re a fucking expert, go lie to your broker and get level 3 options so you can lose all your money.'), ('INFALLIBLE TSLA DD', 'INFALLIBLE TSLA DD'), ("Trading based on the Moon - The wealth strategy 'they' don't want you to know about", "Trading based on the Moon - The wealth strategy 'they' don't want you to know aboutI do my best to only post threads when I've been able to dig up high quality insight on the markets (stolen from OddStats on Twitter) like [Tiger Woods' Major victories being bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bdaysi/spy_returns_the_day_following_a_tiger_woods_major/) or how [People dying on Everest causes equity price's to rise](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bt0yg7/people_dying_on_everest_bullish_indicator/).

His shareholders are the people most likely to grab his attention. Yesterday, ya boy (me) bought two calls that expire next week—therefore I am a shareholder and Elon will care about me...then I can influence him.\n\nI have compiled a comprehensive list of multiple-pointed plans that can help us influence Elon Musk to give us some tendies. You need to understand that Elon is like a reverse vending machine that gives you money, and right now he’s just broken—so we need to influence him and get back to getting tendies.\n\n**Plan A:** Get him to call someone a pedophile on Twitter. Simple, yet effective. Just tweet him a question about Jeffery Epstein and sit back and watch. (Chance of success: 88% // Estimated price movement: $56)\n\n**Plan B:** Find him in person and ask him to buy shares of TSLA. Elon is a great guy, he cares about us. So when you see him, sit down and have an intimate conversation with him. Ask him to buy a few million shares. Gently rub his thigh. If worse comes to worse, he might just hand some cash and tell you to find a motel for the night. Best case scenario, he hands you cash for a motel, and then tweets about how you might be a pedophile. (Chance I’d success: 100% // Estimated price movement: $51)\n\n**Plan C:** Ask Elon to print Beyond Meat out of the TSLA CD trays. Nobody uses CDs anymore, creating new forms of mass and printing food out of it is the new rave. Turn those CD trays into chemically grown meat buffets. May not work if Tesla’s do not have CD trays, but maybe an external part that can connect via Bluetooth or USB would work. Coin flip Chance at success, but massive gainz. (Chance of success: 50% // Estimated price movement: $600+)\n\n**Plan D:** Convert Teslas to run off of coal. The president is a massive supporter of coal, and we have all this coal laying around that nobody uses anymore—maybe daddy Elon should use it to run his cars. No more charging stations, no more coal plants closing. The president will definitely make this a law if we tweet some solid memes at him. (Chance of success: 71% // Estimated price movement: $12)\n\n**Plan E:** Drug Elon and video tape it. This worked for Joe Rogan when he was a desperate bagholder. Now he owned a Tesla—think about that. TSLA price skyrocketed out of sheer pity for Elon after seeing him drugged like that. Better drugs may yield better results. Nobody really knows. (Chance of success: 100% // Estimated price movement: $90)\n\nAny one of these will bring us the tendies back. Elon cares about all of us shareholders.

I will say I am nowhere near finished, but the basics of the app are up and running. That being said, **there is zero error handling**, if you fuck up and put something like 200 in for the ticker the app will crash.\n\nThe app is called OptionDB and the idea is that with it you can create and maintain your own options database filled with historical data to back test strategies or create 3D surface plots like this: [https://imgur.com/a/NXqi2NM](https://imgur.com/a/NXqi2NM). This is the 3D volatility surface for MSFT calls yesterday. I should say upfront that besides the 3D plotting, the app only works to store and maintain the data, **it is pretty much up to the user as to how they want to use it**. I have my own custom scripts for my own analysis, say tracking the net delta exposure on all QQQ calls/puts, may add this in latter.\n\nI bundled the app along with all the packages into a .exe file but I recognize the downloading a exe from a unverified publisher is sketchy so I will detail two different ways you can set it up.\n\n1. If you want to use the executable it is fairly simple, but you **must have a Windows system**. Download the executable from this dropbox link: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bh6hqq4p6ttnr91/MainWindow.exe?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bh6hqq4p6ttnr91/MainWindow.exe?dl=0).  After that, move the executable to to the folder of your choice. Then in your C drive create a folder named OptionDB. This will be the directory for the database files so the path must be **C:/OptionDB**. \n\n2. If you want to build it from the source or just view the code, the GitHub is: [https://github.com/Nathan-T1/OptionDB](https://github.com/Nathan-T1/OptionDB). I will not go into detail as to how to set it up python as I assume if you go this route you have some level of python knowledge. Just make sure to build the directory exactly as seen in the repository, add paths to the Data and UI folder, and create the folder for the database as mentioned above.\n\nNow all you need is a Tradier API key, which can be obtained by signing up here: [https://developer.tradier.com/user/sign\\_up](https://developer.tradier.com/user/sign_up). I am not affiliated with them in any way, just a good free options API that I like. After making an account request your free API Key.\n\nNow you can open the executable or run the app you built from my source. When your open the app for the first time you will need to do complete 3 things. One, press the Generate DB button on the left side. Next press the Generate Archive. Finally press the API key button and enter your key in.\n\nNow you are ready to use it. The rest of this post will be detailing how to use it and what all the buttons do.\n\nTo start off, press Update DB. This is the main functionality of the app and will be run frequently. Your first time opening it, you will need to add the tickers you wish to store data on then press add after each one. The more you do, the longer it will take to pull and more storage it will take. \n\nAfter you have your list, you can press the Update Database button. Only press this button once per day after 5 pm eastern or you will create duplicates in your database. Depending on how many tickers you store, this can take around 5 minutes. Now you can export your data into a csv by pressing the Export Day button or Export Custom. These functions will export a csv to wherever the exe is located based on what you fill in. \n\nIf you just want a quick one day pull you can press the Single pull button. Enter the ticker and destination, **do not press SQL** if you have already updated your database for the day. Custom pull is self-explanatory, don’t list strikes if you have more than one ticker.\n\nFor Export Custom, **always put 0 in for days**, haven’t added the custom functionality for this yet. Otherwise Self-explanatory.\n\nTo create a 3D mesh, press Create Mesh. You can only create mesh if you have the data in your database. The possible targets you can use are **last, ask, bid, volume, weighted\\_volume, IV**. Will add more latter. Check Export mesh if you want it to export the grid as a csv. Note the IV solver is not perfect, but you can export it as a mesh and work with it your self if you get a weird surface.\n\nThat is pretty much it. The rest is up to you. If you want **my historical data the dropbox is**: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ma4369ld27wwew6/MAIN.db?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ma4369ld27wwew6/MAIN.db?dl=0). I accidentally overwrote most of my data two weeks ago, so most if it got deleted. Also, the dates for the SPY table are fucked up, haven’t had time to change it so only query from the last two days for SPY. \n\nIf you use my data base, place it in the folder I mentioned above, but **do not press the Generate DB button** inside the app when you first start the app, but you will need to press the API key.  \n\nI have gotten the executable to work on two different systems, but I am guessing there will be problems. Let me know if there are any questions. If you plan on using this a lot or want to see the data, I highly recommend downloading DB Browser from [https://sqlitebrowser.org/](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).  You can edit and update data and execute SQL queries if you know that shit. \n\nIf your app keeps crashing, run it from the command line and it will display some form of error, maybe I can help fix it.'), ('$AMZN Earnings shitpost', '$AMZN Earnings shitpostWhich one of you Autists bought these? lol  \n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/3r8tfjhfohc31.png'), ('Whats your biggest accidental gain/loss?', 'Whats your biggest accidental gain/loss?Sold some AMD call options when they were peaking yesterday, and decided to roll those into $TSLA shares to make a quick buck on earnings.

That follows this past Friday’s report of second -quarter GDP, which grew at a better than expected 2.1% but showed clear signs of impact from tariffs and trade friction.\n*****\n&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new highs, as investors anticipated a Fed rate cut, and also a better-than-expected earnings season. Earnings growth is slightly positive so far this quarter, but that could improve with another big wave of earnings in the week ahead, when nearly a third of the S&amp;P 500 report.\n*****\n&gt; Apple, Exxon Mobil, Procter and Gamble, Merck, General Motors and Verizonare among companies reporting. Beyond Meat, the hot IPO with a market cap bigger than a quarter of companies in the S&amp;P 500, reports Monday. Seventy-five percent of companies have beaten estimates so far and 60% beat revenue expectations.\n*****\n&gt; It will be the Fed though that will likely have the most market impact, and strategists are looking for the central bank to signal it is open to future cuts but not necessarily promising them. Economists mostly expect anywhere from one to three rate cuts this year, but there is near consensus that this first cut will be a quarter percentage point.\n*****\n&gt; “The market is pricing in a 25 basis point cut,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist with Prudential Financial. “We already know of two Fed presidents who don’t think we need it, so there’s obviously going to be a discussion, with the strong data. The chairman, who is in the camp that we need to have an insurance cut, is going to make the case that while the economic data are all gaining strength, they are still worried about weakening conditions, due to uncertainty regarding trade and tariffs.”\n*****\n&gt; The strains of the trade war and tariffs showed up in a reduction in gross private domestic investment in second quarter GDP of 5.5%, the worst decline in that category since 2015. Within that, exports fell 5.2%. The decline in business investment wiped a full percentage point from the final GDP number.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed has boxed itself into moving rates, says JP Morgan US chief eocnomist\n*****\n&gt; In the last several weeks, as the Fed meeting edged closer, economic data began to show signs of improvement from a soft patch this winter and spring. Consumers, who comprise 70% of the economy, strengthened in the second quarter, with consumption up 4.3%, its best reading since the fourth quarter of 2017.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed “will signal they’re’ going to go on if conditions warrant it. It’s clear the chairman and his cohorts are not looking at incoming data in the sense that they are data dependent. They made it clear they want to inoculate the economy,” Krosby said.\n*****\n&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint, said he expects the Fed to cut rates just once and then stop.\n*****\n&gt; “They’re not going to say that we’re done. I think it would be too much of a leap for the market. My sense is they’ll leave the door open, but their aim is not going to be locked in for the next meeting. It’s clearly a function of how the data play out,” Stanley said. “I’m just more optimistic than they are about the how things are going to evolve.”\n*****\n&gt; Investors will also be watching for headlines on trade in the coming week, as the U.S. delegation returns to China for the first round of face to face talks since May.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qIIO6nE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/RrxEssP.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/X3jETZh.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/ZPrkyNm.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ptHTv4U.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DCcXfwD.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/lxlltRX.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jse4rUG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for next week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SyyFomj.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/IGWYNX7.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/FFNwff2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/dKsX4FB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ZQ2dOjE.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/mn6JY5y.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 7/26/19\n\n&gt; The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index kicked off this week's busy macroeconomic data slate on a disappointing note with a still negative reading that was below forecasts. Weak data continued to come in on Tuesday with FHFA home price growth slowing to 0.1% and the Richmond Fed Manufacturing index reaching a multi-year low. Existing Home Sales also came in weaker. Preliminary Markit PMIs released on Wednesday came in below estimates and weaker than the previous month while the services portion saw the opposite results. The release of preliminary Durable Goods and Capital Goods on Thursday came in much stronger than both expectations and the May release. Meanwhile, weekly labor data once again came in at a multi-month low. We ended the week with stronger than expected GDP data, but it still showed the economy slowed versus the first quarter. Overall, economic data didn't have the greatest of weeks with over half of the indicators released weakening or coming in below estimates.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Eco1.png))**\n\n&gt; Next week is a busy one when it comes to macroeconomic developments. The week starts off quiet with only the Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity Index out on Monday. It is expected to rebound to -5 off its multiyear low of -12.1 from its June release. Things pick up on Tuesday with the release of personal income and spending data which are forecast to fall 0.1%. PCE data, Pending Home Sales, and consumer confidence will also be out that day. Ahead of Friday's Nonfarm Payrolls report, which is expected to show 170K added jobs in July, on Wednesday ADP will release their own employment data. Also on Wednesday, there will be an FOMC rate decision followed by a presser by Fed Chair Powell. Markets are anticipating a 25 bps cut in this meeting. After digesting the results of this meeting, on Thursday ISM will release their manufacturing report for July. In addition to the NFP report, the release of the June trade balance, factory orders, and the University of Michigan's sentiment data will all round out the week on Friday.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Eco2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Bespoke Report -- Global Macro Outlook\n\n&gt; This week we're outlining how we see the global economy at present, along with its influence on US interest rates, credit, commodities, and equity markets. One of the topics we discuss in detail is the strong performance of US GDP in Q2, which in addition to upward revisions from 2014-2018 also showed newly-reported Q2 growth that was far stronger than analyst estimates. Smaller-than-expected headwinds from trade and inventory and a massive surge in consumer spending helped push growth above expectations despite weak investment. With the Fed set to join the global central bank easing party at its July meeting, it's part of the reason to expect that the global backdrop is set to improve.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/072619-Bespoke-Report-Sample.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Closer: End of Week Charts -- 7/26/19\n\n&gt; Looking for deeper insight on global markets and economics?

This tells us the technicals may now be aligning with our optimistic fundamental outlook for financials, which we highlighted in our Midyear Outlook 2019.\n\n&gt; Financials’ strong performance has continued a few weeks into July, with the S&amp;P 500 Financials Index and KBW Bank Index both outpacing the market thus far. Defensive areas of the market, including the utilities, real estate, and healthcare sectors, have all lagged the S&amp;P 500 since the end of the first quarter. We think cyclicals’ outperformance could continue if economic fundamentals improve.\n\n&gt; “The rotation from defensive stocks, which have led for much of the past year, to more cyclical areas of the market, is not only healthy for the bull market, but should favor active managers who can overweight these sectors,” according to LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch.\n\n&gt; While we don’t anticipate broad market performance to be as strong in the second half of 2019, we believe that an overweight to financial stocks may offer an opportunity for suitable investors based on attractive valuations, a potentially steeper yield curve, and an improving technical picture.\n\n*****\n\n# August: Better in Pre-Election Years, But Still Not Great\n\n&gt; Money flows from harvesting made August a great stock market month in the first half of the Twentieth Century. It was the best month from 1901 to 1951. In 1900, 37.5% of the population was farming. Now that less than 2% farm, August is amongst the worst months of the year. It is the worst DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 31 years, 1988-2018 with average declines ranging from 0.1% by NASDAQ to 1.1% by DJIA.\n\n&gt; In pre-election years since 1950, Augusts’ rankings improve modestly: #7 DJIA, #8 S&amp;P 500, #10 NASDAQ (since 1971), #9 Russell 1000 and #10 Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in pre-election years is positive except for Russell 2000 which is unchanged.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b2c259751b53bc3c3005d4c266dd9fac/b4aa95c4256eed3a-ce/s400x600/345335a8152d24b9b10af91f813c9bf07af456fe.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. The best DJIA gains occurred in 1982 (11.5%) and 1984 (9.8%) as bear markets ended. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011 and 2013 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline. A strong August in 2014 of S&amp;P 3.8% and NASDAQ 4.8% preceded corrections of 7.4% and 8.4% respectively from mid-September to mid-October.\n\n*****\n\n# Second-Half Pre-Election Year Blues Absent…So Far\n\n&gt; A little over one week ago, we posted updated charts of historical pre-election year performance with 2019 overlaid for comparison. Like then DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ are still comfortably above average for this time of a pre-election year when compared to historical data. Thus far earnings have supported a continuation of the rally. A 100% probability (according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool as of today) that the Fed will cut rates at least 0.25% is also aiding. And now it appears the debt ceiling is going to be raised eliminating another market headwind. \n\nIt would seem the market has nearly everything going its way. Almost, sentiment is running on the frothy side. According to Investors Intelligence, bullish advisors have reached 58%, a new high for 2019, while bearish advisors are down to just 16.8%. Historically these levels have been an early warning. Combined with the historically meager gains in the second half of pre-election years (visible in the charts below), the rally appears to be increasingly prone to faltering. If the market does take a pause and consolidate some of its gains so far this year in August/September/early-October, it would likely improve the possibility of a respectable fourth quarter rally.\n\n&gt;

I let my pops know I was going to manage some of it myself, essentially swing trade it or let it sit in something passive for weeks at a time. In true WSB style, I was mostly in $TVIX and $UGAZ then slingin' some FD's here and there. I took a decent sized hit on $V ER, opened the day down a considerable amount. I went to work with the two remaining day trades I had and got in some pre earnings $TSLA FDs finishing the day roughly even, I was happy with it. Then $TSLA ER happened, quick pop up to 268, no buyers and down she went, nearly 12%. Opened the next day down even lower, I wasn't gonna fold, but I was a little more tense at this point. I went big on $TSLA calls shortly after, doubled my losses on $TSLA and took a decent chunk out of my newly acquired funds. Spent most of the rest of the day kind of sulking and feeling sorry for myself until I was sitting at my desk..10 minutes to closing bell. I noticed $SBUX ER was at the end of the day, a name I was very familiar with, had been following it for weeks, played Q3 ER of 2018 and made a considerable amount then as well. I took the remainder of what I had in my account after being down more than a couple grand and all-inned $SBUX. I sat there for minutes after the bell, it actually even moved down about 1.5% before jumping more than $6, a huge beat. I made seven grand the next morning selling shortly after the opening bell. \n\nI felt compelled to share my degeneracy with you folks here because if this story inspired even one of you, it'd be worth the fifteen minutes I spent typing it.

That would be around a 3% decline from the highs of this week. \n\nMost likely/neutral scenario: \n\nwe mill around a bit at this price level ultimately breaking the short term trend line/relative support around $291.50 - $290.50 and then ultimately my price target would be somewhere around the low of the May dip @ $275ish give or take. But keep in mind that it looks like that would be creating the head of a much larger H&amp;S pattern if we bounce back up from there. The H&amp;S pattern would be negated if we reach back up to the $301 price level, and if that happens my price target is around $304. If this plays out it’s be a 8-9% decline from the highs. \n\nBest case for the bears scenario: \n\nwe break through the major support at $275ish and then my next price target would be around the $250 price range. Keep in mind this is still a relatively bullish analysis as some chartists are calling for a ~30% drop. I’m not sold on this being it though. If we do hit that long term trend line at around $250 and it holds expect us to rip to new highs by EOY. If it breaks, buy gold, run for cover and try not to check your portfolio. If this plays out and trend line holds it’d be about a 15% decline from the highs. \n\nAs i got rekt on AMZN and AMD earnings i’m really just holding onto the seat of my pants with a couple OTM puts and a fat silver play but these are my price targets.'), ('SPY down and suddenly the sub is all bears.

It urged the US to abandon “its illusions”, “shoulder some responsibility” and get back on track in resolving the trade dispute. The Commerce Ministry did however say that the door for trade talks with the US remains wide open, but that China will never give in the blackmail and intimidation. China did not go as far as to call off talks scheduled for later in the month, but warned “the US must show sincerity”. Similar punchy talk followed from China’s US Ambassador Xhang; he said if the US wants to talk about trade, then so will China but if the US want to fight, so will China. He added that new tariffs are an irrational and irresponsible act and reiterated the Chinese stance; that Beijing will take new adequate countermeasures against.\n\n* TRUMP: The President later said that the US has to have a better deal, not an even deal, with China; says China has a lot to do to turn things around, and he can always raise tariffs.\n\n* KUDLOW:\xa0In a wide-ranging interview,White House Economic Advisor Kudlow walked back on earlier reports that the Trump Administration was considering delaying the tariffs should China meet certain conditions; he said he had not heard anything definitive about a possibility of China tariff delays, before adding that US President Trump is not satisfied with progress in talks. Kudlow caveated, saying that a number of good things could happen in the month prior to tariffs going on Chinese goods and good things could happen at the US/China talks in September, before adding that he anticipates a very small impact on consumers from the tariffs. Switching to the topic of the EU; Kudlow said that US President Trump doesn\'t like the idea that Europe is "manipulating" the EUR and that negative rates in Europe reflect the terrible European economy. Kudlow concluded by reiterating the Trump Administration has ruled out any currency intervention.\n\n* US/CHINA TRADE - ANALYSIS:\xa0US President Trump’s decision to put 10% tariffs on the remaining (untariffed) USD 300bln worth of Chinese imports starting in September follows the return of US negotiators from Shanghai, and “likely signals that US-China talks did not make sufficient progress to convince the White House that a deal was likely in the near-term”, notes Goldman. US President Trump’s tweets also contained positive comments, including “continuing our positive dialogue with China on a comprehensive trade deal”. Goldman suggests that there is a possibility that this decision could be a way to apply extra pressure in a bid to extract concessions ahead of the next round of trade talks in Washington in September. “If so” the bank says “it suggests that these tariffs are not a foregone conclusion.” This line of thinking was confirmed by CNBC reports, which suggested that the Trump administration may be willing to shelve China tariffs if China takes positive (although Chinese officials have vowed not to “give an inch” according to an SCMP commentary). Goldman concludes that the tariffs are more likely to be implemented than delayed or called off. Regarding the implementation of new tariffs; most of the domestic barriers to the implementation of these tariffs have already been lifted. USTR Lighthizer released a proposed list of products subject to tariff (so-called “List 4”) and held public hearings. The bank now awaits release a final proposal with a slightly revised list as well as a 10% tariff rate and an implementation date (likely 1 September); these tariffs would then take automatic effect unless extra measures were taken to reverse them. Goldman points out than consumer goods will be hit the hardest by these tariffs, making up 62% of the tariffed goods. Capital and intermediate goods, which constituted the bulk of the previous three tranches, make up 38%. The bank points out that much of the new tariffs on goods will be concentrated in areas that have thus far been unscathed by prior rounds of tariffs, including apparel and footwear, Toys and phones, which raises the risk of firms passing this cost on to the consumer. As such, Goldman expects new tariffs to be politically unpopular. Regarding how the new tariffs might affect the data; Goldman expect these tariffs to push up core PCE inflation by just over 20bps by year-end, and estimate a hit to GDP of between 0.1-0.2%, added to the 0.2% hit from the tariffs already imposed. It adds that the hit to GDP could rise to 0.5-0.6% if the tariffs on USD 300bln of China imports is raised to 25%. However, other analysts have argued that these tariffs will contribute to the global slowdown, contributing to recent downward pressure on global prices from the demand side. Regarding the impact of this latest round of tariffs on Fed policy; as made clear in Wednesday’s FOMC statement and press conference, trade related uncertainty was a significant factor in the Fed’s decision to make a 25bps “insurance” cut. Goldman Sachs concludes that the announcement of further tariffs increases the likelihood of a rate cut at September’s FOMC meeting.\n\n* FED: Fed\'s George (voter, hawk) explains her dissent at Wednesday\'s FOMC, saying the moderation in the economy was in line with her outlook at the start of the year; says there are risks to her outlook, and she will be data dependent in shaping her outlook.

Although later reports suggested satellite imagery had shown a potential continuation of operations at a North Korean Uranium Enrichment Plant. Elsewhere, Chinese UN Ambassador said that the US cannot ask North Korea to do “as much as possible” while it holds sanctions on the country.\n\n\n* US NFP DATA:\xa0Headline nonfarm payrolls printed in line with expectations at 164k, once again signalling that domestic data in the US is holding up well amid fears of global secular stagnation. Today\'s data is being framed in the context of US President Trump\'s ramping up of trade tensions, and specifically, what impact it has on the Fed\'s rate path; the Fed has, of course, cut rates as insurance against a slowdown and debasing of inflation expectations amid global trade wars. However, Capital Economics says that the relative resilience of employment growth suggests that trade tensions alone won’t necessarily be enough to convince officials to cut rates again. The details of the report were encouraging: participation rose, and wage growth was a little firmer than expected. "Overall, this report won’t be enough to move the needle much in either direction as far as a September rate cut is concerned, but it reinforces our sense that another move next month isn’t yet as sure a thing as the markets are now pricing in."\n\n\n* US UNI OF MICHIGAN/FACTORY ORDERS:\xa0\nConsumer sentiment was 98.4 in the final June data, a touch short of the consensus 98.5: The expectations gauge was firmer than expected at 90.5, while conditions slipped to 110.7 against an expected rise to 111.6 from 111.6. The one-year inflation gauge was unchanged at 2.6%, though the 5-10-year gauge declined to 2.5% versus 2.6% prior. “Factory orders increased in June but were revised down in May, but growth in core capital goods orders and shipments was revised down in June and May," Goldman Sachs said, adding that following the data, its July Current Activity Indicator remained at +1.4%. Goldman Sachs lowers Q3 GDP tracking estimate by one tenth to +1.8% (QOQ AR), leaves past-quarter GDP tracking estimate for Q2 unchanged at +2.0% (compared to +2.1% as originally reported).\n\n\n* BREXIT: The UK Conservative Party lost its Brecon, Wales seat in a by-election, which was won by the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, cutting the ruling Conservative Party’s working majority (which includes 11 DUP votes) to just one and as such, increasing the likelihood that the Party might lose a vote no-confidence prior to 31 October, on which day UK PM Johnson has pledged to take the UK out of the EU deal or no deal. Notably, the swing from the 2017 election, which saw the Conservatives win the seat from the Liberal Democrats, was quite sizeable, likely raising concerns within the government over UK PM Johnson’s chances should it come down to a general election. Analysts pointed out that the presence of the Brexit party in the bi-election, who have largely garnered votes from the Conservative Party, helped facilitate the Liberal Democrat win, by effectively splitting the “Brexit” vote (note: the UK operates a “first past the post” election system, where the party with the most votes in each constituency wins the seat and other parties receive zero representation).\n\n\n* WTI FUTURES (V9) SETTLE USD 1.71 HIGHER AT USD 55.66/BBL: Crude sold off heavily on Thursday, as trade tensions between US and China ramped up, bringing the demand side of the equation into focus.

"Traders seem to have concluded, not unreasonably, that Thursday’s sell-off was an overreaction to the latest US move to add tariffs on Chinese goods," Citi said, "concerns over slowing petroleum demand growth remain, but we continue to note offsetting declines in OPEC production for July, at least according to most early estimates."

It urged the US to abandon “its illusions”, “shoulder some responsibility” and get back on track in resolving the trade dispute. The Commerce Ministry did however say that the door for trade talks with the US remains wide open, but that China will never give in the blackmail and intimidation. China did not go as far as to call off talks scheduled for later in the month, but warned “the US must show sincerity”. Similar punchy talk followed from China’s US Ambassador Xhang; he said if the US wants to talk about trade, then so will China but if the US want to fight, so will China. He added that new tariffs are an irrational and irresponsible act and reiterated the Chinese stance; that Beijing will take new adequate countermeasures against.\n\n* TRUMP: The President later said that the US has to have a better deal, not an even deal, with China; says China has a lot to do to turn things around, and he can always raise tariffs.\n\n* KUDLOW:\xa0In a wide-ranging interview,White House Economic Advisor Kudlow walked back on earlier reports that the Trump Administration was considering delaying the tariffs should China meet certain conditions; he said he had not heard anything definitive about a possibility of China tariff delays, before adding that US President Trump is not satisfied with progress in talks. Kudlow caveated, saying that a number of good things could happen in the month prior to tariffs going on Chinese goods and good things could happen at the US/China talks in September, before adding that he anticipates a very small impact on consumers from the tariffs. Switching to the topic of the EU; Kudlow said that US President Trump doesn\'t like the idea that Europe is "manipulating" the EUR and that negative rates in Europe reflect the terrible European economy.

I just want to point out every recession is different, the tech bubble burst was different from the 2007/8 financial crisis. While you can place bets on which companies will go up and down, there are a few facts that will remain true. People will lose their jobs, there will be foreclosures, repossessions, and debt balances that go unpaid. This is unfortunate but all you autists want to know how to profit. I will try to explain why my thesis is a less risky play than betting on one specific point of failure. \n\n**Thesis:** While consumer confidence droops are in the headlines, it's still at a pretty healthy level and doesn't impact the thesis at all.

For simplicity, everything is this post is based off the closing prices on Monday August 18th as shown on Robinhood. The options are:\n\nTWTR 9/20 $36C paid $505 worth $610 ($40 extrinsic value)\n\nMOMO 10/18 $29.4 C paid $255 worth $635 ($129 extrinsic value)\n\nAMD 11/15 $28 C paid $370 worth $533 ($185 extrinsic value)\n\nMU 1/17/20 $35 C paid $380 worth $1,183 ($182 extrinsic value)\n\nFor the cumulative position, I spent $1,510; it\'s now worth $2,961. Please consider these choices (and the\xa0myriad combinations in between). I could of course sell it all now, doubled my money, sweet, nice rip: $1,451 into my short term cap gains pile for 2019 (not big unfortunately) and move on to the next play. But, as I said, I\'m bullish these companies and like the idea of holding more shares, so....\n\nA) sell it all now, buy the shares.\xa0 Buy doing this I save the extrinsic value of $536 that would otherwise slowly dwindle. To buy all 400 shares I need $15,265, $4,170 (TWTR), $3,446 (MOMO), $3,148 (AMD), $4,501 (MU). So I\'d be using the $2,961 the calls are currently worth and needing to pony up $12,304. I don\'t have $12k lying around and would have to sell shares I have invested elsewhere to take these on.\n\nB) hold and exercise. To do this, I need to come up with $3,600 on 9/20, $2,940 on 10/18, $2,800 on 11/15, and $3,500 on 1/17/20 for a total of $12,840 over the next 5 months.\xa0\n\nBy moving forward with plan B I would essentially be borrowing $12,304 (cost to take on all shares now) and paying it back in almost monthly installments (9/20, 10/18, 11/15 and 1/17), with $536 total interest paid (4.03%) between now and January. Under A I could also immediately start selling covered calls. Side thought/question: could I do better than that on margin?\xa0\xa0\n\nBut they\'re called options for a reason baby! I don\'t have to do any of this.\xa0 I only have $1,510 at risk as of now, can sell at any time, one or all, whether because I change my mind about the companies involved, or about the market or whatever. I can also sell before an IV spike from one of the binary events left to play with (MOMO next week, MU sept, AMD oct, MU dec).\xa0But for the sake of the upcoming math, let\'s say I either sell now and buy the shares (A) or hold them all to the bitter end (B).\xa0\n\nIf these stocks all tank 20% and expire worthless, under B I\'d be out by initial investment $1,510 (less \\~$100 as the Micron call would still expire barely ITM). Losing $1,400 (-100%) on a play isn\'t great. But if I had sold the calls and bought the shares (A), I\'d be down approx. $3,052 (and still owe short term capital gains tax on the $1,451 profit from the options adding insult to injury). If they crash further under A that loss of course also grows but under B I can do no worse than down $1,510 (-100%).\n\nIf these stocks end up worth precisely their current value upon expiration, my position will be worth $15,265, and I\'ll have paid $13,814 to get there under A (a gain of $1,451, same as today, 10.5%) or have paid $14,350 to get there under B (a gain of $915, 6.37% gain).\n\nIf these stocks all gain 20% from today\'s price, then on 1/17/20 my position will be worth $18,318 (TWTR 5,004, MOMO $4,135, AMD $3,778, MU $5,401 and it will have cost me $14,350 to get there (up $3,968, a 27.65% gain) no cap gains owed and can hold the shares into the sunset. Under A I would be up $4,504 or 32.6%.\n\nConsidering this, I\'m leaning towards letting these ride and seeing what happens, with the intention of holding through expiration and exercising. I love the flexibility I receive in return for abandoning the $536 of extrinsic value currently in my unrealized pocket. If after the dust settles the new position (100 shares each of TWTR, MOMO, AMD, and MU) collectively increases in value to $15,857, an increase of 3.87% from Monday\'s closing prices, I will match the unrealized profits I have currently in the position.  Anything above that is gravy, and anything below that and I have so many "options" to mitigate the risk and protect my capital if things go south with any or all of the underlying stocks. I\'d only have $1,510 at risk until 9/20, $5,110 at risk until 10/18, $8,050 at risk until 11/15, and $10,850 at risk until 1/17/20 with the potential of guaranteed entry to a position with a cost basis of $14,350 potentially worth well above the current value of $15,265.  As opposed to, under A, having $15,265 at risk from the jump. \n\nAlso, the kicker is that I\'m avoiding somewhere in the neighborhood of $400 in taxes when paying $536 for all this flexibility!'), ('SPY and 295', 'SPY and 295Yo peeps \n\nI’m here to throw out something that most of the big boys and heavy hitters already know. 295 is the key ceiling / bottom for SPY tendies. \n\nIf we don’t break 295 today (maybbbbeeeee tomorrow) we will head back down to 282. \n\nIf you’re holding puts please for the love of god close them once 296 breaks.

The trade war is going to hit it\'s peak in January - May 2020. Details insideBackground: I spent a year in Beijing, speak Chinese, lived with a Chinese family for several months, and have an advanced degree in Chinese Studies from a top-3 international affairs institution in the U.S., and have followed China related news closely for the past 8 years. I have called China \'right\' to friends and family for two years now and am finally going to put my money where my mouth is. I am sitting on 75k in cash and will be buying a list (bottom of the post) of stocks at the floor of the trade war. \n\nTL/DR : \\*\\*The trade war is going to hit it\'s peak in January - April 2020 and recover after the election\\*\\*. China will use a variety of tools to punish U.S. businesses and dim global economic outlook in order to influence the U.S. election and get rid of Trump. They\'ll do this before the race heats up to either (1) get a \'good\' deal signed (for them), or (2) get rid of trump-- even if it\'s a Pyrrhic victory. Through the election China will refuse to sign a good deal (for us) and will continue to destabilize our economy. If Trump wins, they will likely sign a relatively \'good\' deal, thereby pumping the market. If Trump loses to one of the top 3 currently polling democrats, it is likely the trade war will rapidly deescalate and a mediocre deal will be signed, pumping the market. If Trump signs a shitty deal prior to the election, it\'ll be in May - August 2020--he won\'t capitulate early. In each scenario, the market bottoms out January - April 2020 and rebounds after the election. \n\n\\*\\*DETAILS\\*\\*\n\nWhile Trump was initially welcomed by Beijing because he discredits U.S. style governance, he is now seen as a huge destabilizing factor due to his bold unilateral sanctions, arms sales to Taiwan, his willingness to double-cross agreed upon deals, and his personal affronts to Xi. China wants him out--not only to save face for Xi, but because China doesn\'t have the economic ammunition to easily-sustain the trade war for 5 years without major domestic risks. China wants a democrat who will refocus on domestic issues (wealth cap, single payer, etc) and let China continue to do what it\'s been doing for 20 years: stealing IP and pumping it\'s domestic economy and infrastructure. Therefore, for a variety of strategic / economic and social (face saving for China / Xi) reasons, China is going to try and use the trade war to unseat Trump in 2020. \n\nHowever, Xi DOES face risks and NEEDS a deal in the next year. A pronounced Chinese recession greatly raises the possibility that their banking sector will continue to suffer collapses (3 major banks so far), and there ever-present specter of the housing crunch that people have been predicting for 10 years. Issues like these have always been the harbinger of domestic unrest and revolution (internal to the party--forget massive peasant uprisings). The Party is hyper-sensitive to domestic disturbances, especially in light of how the Arab Spring went. With HK in uproar, a recession could easily spark a "Chinese Spring". Worse, a recession will embolden Xi\'s domestic Party rivals )who still exist regardless of the crackdowns). There is truth in the accusation that Xi was \'too bold\' with (1) Made in China 2020, (2) OBOR, (3) South China Sea claims, (4) Taiwan pressure, etc. Xi moved away from the Deng Xiaoping consensus of \\~\\~develop quietly and pull a fait accompli once you are stronger than your enemy\\~\\~. A major Chinese recession could lead to Xi\'s rivals to use assassination and co-opting the military (via bribery, and a promise to returning to the days where the "anti corruption drive" (kill your competition drive) wasn\'t proverbially hanging over every party-man\'s head). Just because Xi appears rock-solid does not mean that he doesn\'t lose sleep over the implications that a major Chinese recession would have for him. I see that theory thrown around a lot and think its patently false. Any cursory study of authoritarian regimes shows how hyper-sensitive they are to social disturbance, optics, economic destabilization, etc. \n\nWhat Trump (1) wants or (2) thinks he needs to get reelected is not a core part of this analysis and here is why: China will take actions to unseat him SOONER than he would either (1) accept or (2) reject a shitty-deal the Chinese will put forward (that would pump the economy for him leading to the election). He has staked his ego to this and he\'s been anti-China for decades. If he signs a \'shitty\' deal, it will only be a last-resort prior to the election, AFTER my estimated time frame of \'max trade war bullshit\' in January - April 2020. There are 3 basic scenarios. (1) Trump signs a shitty deal in mid 2020, claims victory over China leading into the election. The market goes up as a result. (2) Trump rejects a deal in mid 2020, goes into the election and wins. In this scenario, China will eventually sign a decent deal because Trump will be emboldened to continue the trade war, won\'t face reelection, and China doesn\'t have the ammunition to continue the fight. The market goes up as a result. (3) Trump rejects a deal in mid 2020, loses the election, and a democrat gets elected, who will summarily sign a shitty deal so they can pump the market and focus on domestic programs (see below), the market goes up as a result (dependent, ofc, on what that democrat is doing domestically). In any of these scenarios, the market hits the floor in my timeframe and recovers at the end of the year. \n\nThe current leading democrats are very likely to sign a shitty deal with China. Biden has signaled he wants to deescalate the trade war. Ignore his words about other-solutions--the TPP failed, and any regional economic framework is likely to fail again for a variety of reasons I\'m happy to discuss if someone wants to. Warren is anti-China but more so for humanitarian reasons rather than trade, economic, and strategic reasons. She and Bernie (who I won\'t even waste time covering because it is self evident he doesn\'t care about China) are both therefore unlikely to continue to keep the trade war going. It is an EASY win for them to sign a shitty "good" deal, pump the market, and rain tendies on the people during their first  administration (This theory does not play out if Booker wins the nomination--be aware) while they pursue social programs and cut military spending. \n\nWhile U.S. imports to China don\'t offer much room for vertical trade war escalation, there are many non-trade ways China can fuck with U.S. companies and the economy writ large leading up to the election. Expect to see certain companies banned from China (or) their assets seized / nationalized. This would freak the market out, as it\'s one thing to levy seemingly-temporary import duties vs deploy police and seize your offices and factories. Expect China and their proxies (North Korea, Iran, etc) to saber rattle and spook global geopolitical tensions. They could outright ban U.S. imports, pull the rare-earth one-time-lever, and pressure the region to follow their lead economically (Southeast Asian countries, etc). All of these factors and even ones I can\'t even dream of will happen in tandem in January - May 2020. \n\n\\---\n\n\\*\\*My Plan\\*\\*\n\nI plan on buying dips in 20% increments between January and May every time there is a major dip. Because the Chinese are going to use a variety of tools to punish us, these tools won\'t all occur on the same day. Tariffs, seizures, saber rattling, etc, it will all occur gradually. I will wait until we have days like Friday where the market drops 4% or so. Every one of these instances I plan on buying SOXX (SOXX is a semiconductor ETF with holdings that is a whose-who list for top Chinese exposure companies, I.E. superconductors), WYNN, AAPL, and TSLA. However, this list is not concluded yet. The real target here is SOXX. My rationale here is that I want to buy stocks that have big China - exposure, but I want to avoid over-weighing myself in certain sectors. It\'s impossible to know what components will get big-tendies from a trade deal (superconductors, cars, consumer electronics, etc). Any input on this is appreciated.'), ('$TSLA $4,200C 11/4/2020', '$TSLA $4,200C 11/4/2020Alright bois, I have some fresh DD.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new holiday-shortened trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 2nd, 2019.\n\n# **Investors say goodbye to choppy August markets but September may be no better  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/investors-through-choppy-august-markets-but-september-may-be-no-better.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stock market investors may be glad to see August go, but September might not be any better, unless there are some positive developments in the trade war.\n*****\n&gt; Markets enter September, anticipating a Federal Reserve rate cut mid-month and worrying the chilling in the global economy will reach the U.S. There appears to be no progress in the trade war between the U.S. and China, and investors are watching to see if it will begin to hit key data.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 fell about 2% for the month, its worst performance since May. August was a month of rising recession worries and trade headlines moved the market in both directions, starting with the Aug. 1 declaration by President Donald Trump that he would put tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese goods.\n*****\n&gt; “If history repeats itself we could see a selloff in September and then we have some sort of capitulation,” said Samuel Stovall, chief market strategist CFRA. “We’re in the midst of what I call a pullback. The line in the sand is really 2,800. If we break meaningfully through that we could end up having a sharp and swift decline.”\n*****\n&gt; The first week of September includes some important reports, including the August employment report on Friday and the ISM manufacturing survey on Tuesday. The auto industry releases monthly vehicle sales Wednesday. Investors will also be looking for news on whether face-to-face negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials can take place in September, as expected after the last round of talks.\n*****\n&gt; For the stock market, September is historically a worse month than August, in terms of losses. “If you thought August was bad, history says September can be worse because not only is it the month with the largest average decline, but is the only month to fall more frequently than it rises,” said Stovall.\n*****\n&gt; Since World War II, the average move for the S&amp;P for all months is a gain of 0.69%, but the average September move is negative 0.54%. The market has been down 55% of the time in September, making it the worst month of the year, but October, which is up 61% of the time, is a more volatile month with historically steeper losses.\n*****\n&gt; Stock investors will also be watching interest rates, which have been in a steep decline in August. In one month, the 30-year bond has lost 60 basis points, to a level under 2%. The widely watched yield curve, between the 2-year Treasury yield and the 10-year yield inverted. That is a recession warning and means the 10-year yield has gotten lower than the 2-year yield, or investors are demanding more yield for shorter term investments.\n*****\n&gt; Investors will be watching to see how the incoming data affects the bond market and most importantly, the Fed. The Fed meets Sept. 17 and 18, and it is expected to cut rates by a quarter point though some bond strategists say it could cut by a half percentage point if the economy softens or markets are highly volatile.\n*****\n&gt; Next week could provide some clues on future monetary policy with Chairman Jerome Powell set to speak next Friday at 12:30 p.m. ET. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman is also set to speak Wednesday at 12:30 p.m. ET.\n*****\n&gt; “Without offering judgment on Powell’s performance heretofore, investors will be seeking clarity on if 2019 will mirror the 1990s (75 bp of aggregate rate cuts) or if the fallout from the trade war has done more damage to the global economy and therefore warrants even greater accommodation,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, in a note.\n*****\n&gt; Economists expect 155,000 jobs were added in August, down from 164,000 in July, according to Refinitiv. They expect the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7% and average hourly earnings to rise by 0.3%.\n*****\n&gt; Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said he is watching the ADP private sector payroll report Thursday, ahead of the government’s report Friday, since it includes details on small business hiring. The sector has shown weakness in the ADP data.\n*****\n&gt; “May and June showed declines. That was the only time since 2010 that ADP showed declines for small employers over the course of the recovery. July was really weak too,” he said. Tilley said it’s unclear why that sector of the job market is showing softening, but since it is the first time since the recovery, it bears watching.\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said job growth appears to be at its weakest of the cycle. The government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics recently revised its job data to show 501,000 fewer jobs from March 2018 to March 2019. Tilley said he looked at the adjustment by spreading the reductions over the period, and it shows job growth was reduced by 41,750 in each of those months.\n*****\n&gt; “It means job growth was never as strong in 2018 as we thought, and the slowness is of concern,” he said. “On the other hand, if total wages and total GDP are unchanged, then the slower job growth came with higher average wages and higher productivity than previously thought.”\n*****\n&gt; The strength of the labor market is key, since it’s been helping fuel the consumer, responsible for about two-thirds of the economy.\n*****\n&gt; “If you’re looking for the recovery to keep going, and if you’re looking at this to be pushing it and consumer spending, this would be a red flag,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; Tilley said he is also watching the ISM manufacturing survey, particularly after Markit PMI data, another series of manufacturing data, showed a contraction. ISM is expected at 51.4, up slightly from 51.2 last month. A reading above 50 shows expansion.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/yCNoIbg.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZpG1YfO.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/cvhGlyR.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/dCcA6bm.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yWC5dZZ.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/R7KWBIx.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/oGbBCzw.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FUy1GB9.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VTBu6gP.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n*(NONE SCHEDULED FOR THIS WEEK)*\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3oUnu3o.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sg7GUFA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Day after Labor Day Bullish for Small Caps\n\n&gt; In the last 21 years, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have all registered average gains of exceeding 0.2% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last seven years, but DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all declined on the day in 2017 and 2018. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 71.4% of the time with an average gain of 0.12%. S&amp;P 500 is worst, up only 38.1% of the time with an average loss of 0.005%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/66d0e165de0d5099b7b8b4f3ad896b90/99822dfcc2c80238-01/s500x750/4f9276207bcd30da1ad67856d0ef0a5a08d48b3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical September Trading: Choppy Early Gains Fade Late\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/59d316c9fcecc63780352f570022c024/502fb4ed37d42dd3-a1/s500x750/c3d1c6969f2f4deb7ac0e36e54cd6643dc73f2ec.jpg))**\n\n&gt; September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small-caps, measured by the Russell 1000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However, after mid-month gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month’s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.\n\n*****\n\n# Down Friday/Down Monday Levels Not Reclaimed Yet\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3e4c044d3d67395aa8ed45109ab5394f/dacebc880c3c9347-ff/s500x750/d19682be7ae94930d29057dffb20f87f0af34de7.jpg))**\n\n&gt; Technically speaking, the market has settled into a range between 2815 and 2945 on the S&amp;P 500. S&amp;P 2815 is a support level we have been tracking for some time now that sits at the intraday high back on November 7, 2018 where the market failed last fall before the 20% correction ran its course to the Christmas Eve low. The good news is the 2815 has held here this time unlike the ~2700 level last fall. \n\n&gt; The bad news or at least the technical case for no new highs is that the S&amp;P has yet to clear the 2945 level, which was the intraday high on Friday August 2 that was the beginning of two back-to-back Down Friday/Down Mondays, which has a negative indication if not quickly reclaimed.\n\n&gt; Fund Flows Still Feeble\n\n&gt; Below is an update of fund flows data from the Investment Company Institute including mutual funds and ETFs. In the tables below, we show dollar fund flows for total mutual funds plus ETFs along with ETFs alone. Obviously, mutual fund flows have been persistently negative for a long time now, but ETF flows are making up for that in many ways. The combined data only goes back to 2013, but over that period total ETF flows are in the 99th percentile for all ETFs...and that includes a string of drawdowns in domestic equity ETF flows over the last few weeks. Combined, ETF plus mutual fund flows are a better measure of total sentiment than mutual funds alone. While ETF fund inflows are only just off record highs, combined mutual fund and ETF fund flows are down across the past week, month, three months, and year for all equity funds, domestic only equity funds, and global equity funds. On the other hand, bond funds have seen the same torrid inflows that have been picked up in mutual fund flows for a long time now: since 2013, total bond inflows to ETFs are near the 97th percentile for all periods. For ETFs plus mutual funds, recent inflows are less dramatic but still very, very large; that’s especially true for the municipal bond space. We also note commodity funds have seen a pickup in net flows of late.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/083019-Flows.png))**\n\n&gt; To provide further context, below we show rolling 13 week fund flows for the total equity space as well as domestic funds only. While ETFs have seen material inflows, combined mutual and ETF flows are still materially negative, with total equity mutual fund plus ETF flows at a record size.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/083019-Flows1.png))**\n\n&gt; B.I.G. Tips - Years Like 2019: August Edition\n\n&gt; We’ve highlighted the chart below comparing 2019 to 1998 a number of times over the last several weeks, and the similarities between the performance of the S&amp;P 500 in each year has continued right up through the end of August. While the pullback from the highs this Summer hasn’t been as severe as it was in 1998, the timing of both and the subsequent periods of backing and filling has been striking. A continuation of the similar patters certainly wouldn’t be a positive in the short term, but the silver lining is that Q4 1998 was exceptionally strong.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chartwebsite1998.png))**\n\n&gt; As we do throughout the year, in our most recent B.I.G. Tips report we compared the S&amp;P 500's trading pattern this year to all other years in order to see which ones were the most similar. With those similar years, we then analyzed how the S&amp;P 500 performed for the remainder of the year in order to help come up with a framework for what to expect for the rest of this year. It shouldn't surprise anyone that 1998 made the list, but a number of other notable years also had strong similarities to the pattern of 1998 with very different outcomes as well.\n\n&gt; Russell 2000 (IWM) Testing Support\n\n&gt; Unlike large-cap major indices like the Dow or S&amp;P 500 which managed to reach record highs earlier this year, so far in 2019, the small-cap focused Russell 2000 never managed to so much as retest the highs from around this time last year. In fact, in the past year, other than the final leg down to December lows and the subsequent rally back up to previous levels in early 2019, the Russell has been in a range between support and resistance from last fall. This support and resistance can actually be traced back even further to the highs and lows of late 2017 and early 2018. This year has seen more tests of these support levels after May declines and once again this month.\n\n&gt; At the beginning of August, the Russell collapsed through flat 50 and 200-DMAs finding relief at the bottom of this range. Since then, the index has been bouncing between this support and the 200-day with the most recent failed test of its 200-DMA coming just last week. Over the past few sessions, while it has not closed significantly below, intraday the index has breached these critical support levels. Fortunately, today the index is seeing some mean reversion from its extreme oversold levels as it is up rather than breaking out of the range to the downside.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-RTY2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# What's Driven the S&amp;P 500?\n\n&gt; In last night's Closer, we showed the biggest contributors to the S&amp;P 500's gain so far in 2019 as well as the stocks that have weighed on the index the most. Given the S&amp;P's 14% YTD gain, it's probably not surprising to hear that only one stock in the entire S&amp;P 500 has weighed on the total index performance by at least 20 bps: Pfizer (PFE). On the other hand, 11 different stocks have added at least 20 bps to total index performance in 2019. We show the 10 best and worst-performing stocks this year by the overall contribution to the S&amp;P 500's performance in the table below. As shown, mega-cap Tech like Microsoft (MSFT) and four of the five FAANG names have been the biggest contributors. When you add them all up, they've accounted for roughly 26% of the S&amp;P's gain this year. Two credit card companies -- Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V), and two retailers -- Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) -- have also been big contributors to gains.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive1.png))**\n\n&gt; At the industry group level, health care stocks related to Pharmaceuticals, Biotech, and Life Sciences are one of only two industry groups to weigh on S&amp;P 500 performance this year. Energy is the other standout with a 4% decline. Software &amp; Services is the best performer, driving 3.3 percentage points of the S&amp;P's 14% gain this year. Media &amp; Entertainment, Retail which includes Amazon (AMZN), and tech Hardware are the only other groups that have added at least 1% to the total 14.46% gain for the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive2.png))**\n\n&gt; While YTD numbers look really great, things are not so hot versus this time last year; the S&amp;P 500 is actually slightly lower year-over-year. As a result, the gap between the contribution of gainers and those of decliners is much narrower. Only four stocks drove a gain of at least 20 bps for the headline index over the past year: Microsoft (MSFT), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V).\n\n&gt; We note that the top ten gainers are almost exclusively very blue-chip stocks: large tech companies, credit card networks, and some consumer names. Only the cell phone tower REIT American Tower (AMT) is unusual in this list of big-cap, well-known stocks. Losers are concentrated in Health Care, Banks, and Tech.\n\n&gt; While Alphabet (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) aren't down drastically versus last summer, their market caps are big enough to have cost a lot of performance for the S&amp;P 500's overall performance. Smaller cap stocks like NVIDIA (NVDA), DuPont (DD), AbbVie (ABBV), and Schlumberger (SLB) are a verry different story.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive3.png))**\n\n&gt; At the industry group level, there have been more decliners than gainers, though only Energy and Banks have cost the index more than 80 bps; on the flip side only Software has been a greater than 80 bps gainer. Defensive industry groups like Utilities, Household &amp; Personal Products, and Real Estate have all driven the S&amp;P 500 higher while cyclical industry groups like Capital Goods and Tech Hardware have weighed.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Drive4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# This Isn't Normal\n\n&gt; Being long bonds these days probably feels like being long tech stocks in the late 1990s. Every day you look at your portfolio, you expect it to be higher than the last time. This month through yesterday, the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year US Treasury Index is up over 10% and that doesn't even include the rally we are seeing today. If the gains we have seen so far hold up into month-end, it will go down as just the 5th month since 1978 that long-term treasuries gained more than 10% in a single month. The last time we saw this large of a move in the long-term Treasury market was more than 10 years ago in November 2008, and before that you have to go all the way back to February 1986. In other words, this kind of move isn't normal.\n\n&gt; Besides the fact that long-term Treasuries are up over 10% this month, August marks the fourth straight month of gains for the asset class, and while that may not sound like much, the last time we saw a streak of four or more months of gains was in January 2015. With all these gains, the Merrill Lynch 10+ Year Treasury Index is up over 22% YTD. 22%!\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/082819-Treasuries.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Consumer Confidence Defies Pessimism\n\n&gt; U.S. consumers are feeling especially empowered these days, despite growing pessimism about the economic outlook.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, Consumer Confidence Pushes Through Trade Uncertainty, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index fell to 135.1 in August. Still, that’s the fifth-highest reading of the economic cycle, an impressive feat given trade tensions and other global headwinds.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zAlOT8M.jpg))**\n\n&gt; August’s strong consumer confidence reading was driven by a 19-year high in consumers’ views of present economic conditions. That’s no surprise to us, as steady gains in wages and jobs typically support consumer spending. Fiscal stimulus implemented in 2018 provided an extra boost of income through lower tax rates and added tax credits, and lower oil prices have allowed consumers to allot more income to discretionary spending.\n\n&gt; “Consumer spending has been one of the most encouraging trends in the economy lately, thanks to a solid U.S. labor market,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “It’s difficult to see a near-term economic downturn with such a strong undercurrent from the U.S. consumer.”\n\n&gt; A U.S. economy carried by the consumer isn’t a bad situation to be in. After all, consumer spending accounts for about 70% of gross domestic product, so healthy consumer activity could carry the expansion on its own.\n\n&gt; However, U.S. businesses need to transition into leadership at this point in the cycle. As we mentioned in Tuesday’s blog, capital expenditures (capex) need to rebound as the cycle matures to help sustain the expansion. Unfortunately, trade uncertainty has increasingly weighed on corporate sentiment, so a resurgence in capex may not be possible without a U.S.-China trade resolution.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending August 30th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFf2UWuAp9c))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 09.01.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtyRgaB9Mcc))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * **$LULU** \n&gt; * **$AEO** \n&gt; * **$CIEN** \n&gt; * **$MDB** \n&gt; * **$COUP** \n&gt; * **$PANW** \n&gt; * **$ZM** \n&gt; * **$CLDR** \n&gt; * **$NAV** \n&gt; * **$CRWD** \n&gt; * **$CONN** \n&gt; * **$MIK** \n&gt; * **$BRC** \n&gt; * **$NSSC** \n&gt; * **$HQY** \n&gt; * **$TUFN** \n&gt; * **$VRA** \n&gt; * **$DOCU** \n&gt; * **$WORK** \n&gt; * **$HOME** \n&gt; * **$SIG** \n&gt; * **$KIRK** \n&gt; * **$GSM** \n&gt; * **$EGAN** \n&gt; * **$SMAR** \n&gt; * **$BITA** \n&gt; * **$ZLAB** \n&gt; * **$DOMO** \n&gt; * **$PVTL** \n&gt; * **$DCI** \n&gt; * **$ZUMZ** \n&gt; * **$LE** \n&gt; * **$GIII** \n&gt; * **$AVAV** \n&gt; * **$SAIC** \n&gt; * **$SCWX** \n&gt; * **$CSTL** \n&gt; * **$PD** \n&gt; * **$GCO** \n&gt; * **$JW.A**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/VTBu6gP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Dui3VqV.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/ciidwK8.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # ***Monday 9.2.19 Before Market Open:***\n&gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.

I\'ve finally pushed the updates that include viewing some nice stock financial charts and fundamental analysis. Here\'s a short breakdown of the new features I\'ve added. If you want a full summary on them, I made a post in r/StockMarket that has a lot more info! The post can be found here\n\n[Fundamental Analysis Post - Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/cvtrpc/i_created_a_stock_market_site_that_visually/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**New Features**\n\n**1)** A new "Stocks" section where you can search stocks outside of the WallStreetBets sentiment. In this section you can search for tickers to do your own fundamental analysis. The stock page contains the following data:\n\n**1-A)** Short-term stock chart, fundamental data, key stats, and recent news.\n\n**1-B)** Stock Financials: For you fake autists you can finally view your favorite stock financials data in nicely organized charts (w/ pretty colors). Here you can quickly scan fundamental financial data to get a quick understanding of how your stock is operating. Personally, I find the charts on the "Fundamental Data" section the most helpful, but if you want to dive into all the financial statements that\'s cool too. For you REAL autists who love crunching numbers switch between "Chart-Mode" and "Textify" to read those beautiful numbers.\n\n**1-C)** Historical Earnings: Wanting to do an EARNINGS YOLO? View how your stock has reacted in the past to previous earnings report and take a gamble where the next one will go. A good example of this is AAPL who\'s stock price has declined on earnings only 1 time! (literal WOW).\n\n**2)** Earnings Calendar: MY earnings calendar isn\'t as pretty as "Earnings Whisperer\'s" calendar, but I feel it provides a bit more data to see who is reporting that day. Scroll below the calendar and you\'ll be able to see all recent earnings reports and stock price reactions to those reports. The calendar only displays stocks greater than 45-50B in MARKET CAP, but there is a button at the top to display ALL upcoming earnings in list-view.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Future Updates** (Here\'s what I am currently working on for the site and should be ready in the next week or two):\n\nI am currently working on adding an "Options Analyzer" tool. The tool will work by scanning day-old options data (maybe 3-4 days old for smaller cap stocks less than 5B) and log it to my database. It will be similar to Barchart\'s "Option" analyzer tool (mine is also FREE), but I wanted to focus on less of an options screener/filter and more on improving how you can compare the prices on purchasing/selling an option. For example, the tool can be used mainly in the following ways:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**1)** View the historical yield for an option of a specific expiration date throughout the entire life of the option. (IE: You view the call option chains for AAPL on September 6, 2019. You will be able to view an estimation of what the options were yielding (say, at 5% OTM) from inception to current date and see how the option price changed with reporting earnings or other market fluctuations/news.\n\n**2)** Filter through a list options of highest premiums and lowest premiums. Use this tool to see where you might want to sell a covered call or a spread and collect premium vs outright buying the option instead. This tool will be great as a guideline rather than an indicator (IE: you see JNUG is at the top of the list providing 10% premium on 2-week options doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s the best option to collect premium on. However, if you\'ve been following AAPL and you see it\'s reached a high of $220 you can then see how much premium you might be able to collect by selling a call spread or covered call.)\n\n**3)** Option Yields Comparisons: Say you\'ve been following 3 stocks: DIS, AAPL, AMZN. You think all 3 stocks have been hit very hard in the short term due to some Trump tweets, so you think it could be a great time to collect some premium by selling PUTS on the stock. The Yields-Comparison tool will be able to show you what each of the 3 stocks are currently offering in terms of yields and help you with your decision.\n\n\\*The options tool will also tell you specifically which options include an upcoming earnings, which would become more of a gamble at that point, so you can avoid accidentally purchasing options that are more expensive due to earnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Here are some notable YOLOs/Gains/Losses from the month of August\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HONORABLE MENTIONS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**AnalyFarmer2\'s Journey**\n\n1) [$180k play with ALGN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckapu5/algn_play_180k_profit_in_5_minutes/)\n\n2) [$277k in one minute with SPY Puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cksrsf/spy_puts_277k_profit_in_1_minute/)\n\n3) [$600k SPY YOLO ($500k LOSS)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckycr2/600k_yolo_in_fds_expiring_tmrw_if_i_die_remember/)\n\n4) [Final YOLO into CGC calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co31pq/my_final_yolo_40k_into_cgc_calls_expiring_next/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe **individual stocks** that provided WSB members with the **biggest GainZ** this month were:\n\nTarget -TGT\n\nActivision - ATVI\n\nFastly - FSLY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Most Insane Active YOLOs:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$170k in CRWD calls - u/IAmABlubFish\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Biggest Gains:**\n\n$782k - [u/jimbeam145](https://www.reddit.com/user/jimbeam145/) (SHOP)\n\n$277k - [u/analfarmer2](https://www.reddit.com/user/analfarmer2/) (SPY)\n\n$180k - [u/analfarmer2](https://www.reddit.com/user/analfarmer2/) (ALGN)\n\n$170k - [u/Yocz23](https://www.reddit.com/user/Yocz23/) (ULTA PUTS)\n\n$160k - [u/Fuyuki\\_Wataru](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fuyuki_Wataru/) (BYND)\n\n$137k - [u/Warbring3r](https://www.reddit.com/user/Warbring3r/) (PINS)\n\n$125k - [u/MoveGEtoWallSt](https://www.reddit.com/user/MoveGEtoWallSt/) (AMZN)\n\n$95k - [u/MBA2016](https://www.reddit.com/user/MBA2016/) (NUGT)\n\n$77k - [u/one\\_roll](https://www.reddit.com/user/one_roll/) (NUGT)\n\n$70k - [u/hskdbaldbeiam](https://www.reddit.com/user/hskdbaldbeiam/) (SPY PUTS)\n\n$61k - [u/BlueberryShakes](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlueberryShakes/) (AMZN)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Biggest Losses:**\n\n\\-$500k - [u/analfarmer2](https://www.reddit.com/user/analfarmer2/) (SPY)\n\n-$46k - [u/oversold1234](https://www.reddit.com/user/oversold1234/) (TEVA)\n\n\\-$45k - [u/EngHH](https://www.reddit.com/user/EngHH/)\n\n-$39k - [u/jxzheng951](https://www.reddit.com/user/jxzheng951/)\n\n-$36k - [u/bluffff](https://www.reddit.com/user/bluffff/) (AMD)\n\n-$32k - [u/hnnnnggggggg](https://www.reddit.com/user/hnnnnggggggg/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any feature recommendations, comments, or concerns post here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGodspeed bois'), ("What y'all think of the SPY keeping up with this price range.

I barely do. Let me break it down for you anyway so we can both have a flawed understanding of it which we base our financial decisions on.\n\n1. High-risk loans are given out. They\'re collateralized. That means businesses don\'t have means to pay it back. This is what makes them high-risk. Technically liquidation of assets given to the lender should be possible in the event of a default but we\'ll get to that.\n2. To make this worse, the institutions and thus paperwork involved in these loans is shit and not transparent at all. My guess is they say something like "here\'s your money. you owe us a tremendous amount of interest which we know you can\'t pay."\n3. So the one of you which is least high on amphetamines might be thinking, "Why would any of these loans be given out if people can\'t pay it?" Good question. Two main reasons: 1. Fed rates were low which made lending like whatever 2. Debt consolidation, why not take the interest your competitors are getting if you\'re the bank? There\'s other reasons too but fuck you.\n4. Quick numbers for you true retards who think the market is rational: **80%** of these CLOs are not sufficiently outlined in the paperwork. There will be wiggle-room for all parties, but mostly for the borrower right now to *just avoid paying*. **85%** of the loans are given to companies which you might call "subprime" in terms of credit. CLOs are a whopping **60%** of the US loan market. That means, as a big picture perspective, that roughly 50% of all US loans are absolutely garbage inflationary horseshit. \n\nThere is a lot more to it. CLOs are also given to companies which are looking to increase dividends if they think that\'ll increase market interest (which it usually does cause dividends are actually smart unlike YOLOing your student loans into small-cap bullshit). \n\nThey can\'t restructure these loans into lower-risk packages for very long.

Growth slowed down and investors fled after a shitty merger with Hortonworks, but they\'ve since been trying to turn the company around. Last quarter they posted revenue of $187M which represented an 81% y/y growth. For the retards in the back, this means they posted close to the revenue of $ROKU last quarter ($250M) at an even better growth rate (81% vs. 59%) for 1/9 the valuation. \n\nLooking at forward revenue, they guided for $180-183M for this upcoming quarterly earnings; I\'m hoping for a solid beat of around $190M. So if we extrapolate a bit, they could see 4-quarter forward revenue (assuming steady growth) of close to $1 billion, which would translate to \\~2 P/S -- when compared to other software stocks that\'s peanuts.\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\nThey recently announced a new platform called Cloudera Data Platform (CDP for short) which aims to take their entire business to the cloud and operate solely on subscriptions, as opposed to the in-person custom solutions they provide now. This \\*should\\* accelerate growth even more and bring in those juicy subscription based revenues that every wall st. analyst gets off to.\n\n**Some other things:**\n\nCarl Icahn, activist investor who bought into $NFLX at $10, recently became involved with the company this summer; he bought up 20% of the shares and installed 2 of his henchmen to the board of Cloudera. This man means business and he won\'t take losses for an answer, even if it means calling up Trump and having him pump the damn thing on twitter.\n\n**Acquisition:**\n\nIn June, Cloudera and IBM announced a "strategic partnership". This comes after IBM had a juicy relationship with Hortonworks, the company that Cloudera merged with. IBM would be a top contender for buying out $CLDR at a fat premium -- they just acquired RedHat for like $30 billion so $2-3 billion would be nothing to them. I\'ve read that Icahn has been encouraging a buyout as well, and I\'d guess Cloudera would go for at $12-15/share.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nOptions are still pretty cheap -- there\'s about a 14% implied move but the stock has seen huge 40% moves after earnings. At a $2B valuation, this seems like a no-brainer. Loaded up on 9/20 $7.50 calls today, and earnings are AH on 9/4.\n\nGood luck!'), ('Picking up nickels in front of a steam roller', 'Picking up nickels in front of a steam rollerAfter my run on Tesla from 190 to 240 I decided to keep 800k in my account and just sell weekly puts on Tesla 20-25 dollars out of the money.

The People's Bank of China was expected to refinance loans issued through a medium-term lending facility today, but it refrained from making that move.

During the August period, the IMX increased to 4.62, up 0.02 or 0.4%, from the previous period.\n\nDuring the August period, TD Ameritrade clients were net buyers overall, and net buyers of equities for the first time in three months. Net buying of equities helped increase the IMX slightly month-over-month, with clients also net buyers of less risky assets, including fixed-income products. Volatility of the S&amp;P 500 spiked during the period, as measured by the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, which reached the mid-20s for the first time since January.\n\nEquity market returns were negative during the period, with the S&amp;P 500 moving lower by 3.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 2.9%. The Tech sector was particularly volatile, with the Nasdaq Composite lower by 4.4%. Equity markets were influenced by a horde of news during the period. The tariff war with China heated up, with each country announcing plans for further escalation. Consumer confidence posted the lowest number since 2016, and the biggest monthly drop since 2012. For the first time since 2007, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yield curve inverted, while the 30-year yield also reached the lowest level ever. Among positive news, manufacturing activity, measured by the Chicago PMI, rebounded back to expansionary territory following a six-point jump from July's three-and-a-half year low. Also, consumer prices rose broadly, with core inflation hitting 2.2%.\n\n**Trading**\n\nTD Ameritrade clients seemed to use the volatility during the August IMX period to purchase certain names. Walt Disney Company (DIS) was a net buy after it traded lower by 5% during the period, and it announced a partnership with Target (TGT) to open Disney stores within Target stores. Amazon Inc. (AMZN) traded lower by 8.5% during the period and has fallen for six straight weeks, and was net bought. Microsoft Inc. (MSFT) was a net buy, with the federal government announcing a massive 10-year, $7.6 billion computing contract to a trio of vendors to provide Microsoft office software for the Pentagon. Beyond Meat Inc. (BYND) paused it's upward run during the period, trading lower by over 25% after hitting an all-time high during July, and was a net buy. UBER Technologies Inc. (UBER) reached a new low since its IPO in May as the company continues to come under fire to reclassify drivers as employees instead of freelancers, and was net bought.\n\nAdditional popular names bought include Ford Motor Company (F), BP (BP), and Abbvie Inc. (ABBV).\n\nAlthough they were net buyers, TD Ameritrade clients found some names to sell during the August period. Apple Inc. (AAPL) was net sold for the third month in a row as the company announced plans to start online sales in India. Semiconductor makers Micron Technology Inc. (MU) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) were both net sells during the period. Both stocks received analyst upgrades during the period, and were pressured by the tariff tension with China. Corteva Inc. (CTVA), the agricultural input provider that was spun off from Dupont (DD), saw a volatile period after the U.S. Department of Agriculture updated its crop production estimates for the coming harvest, and was net sold. AT&amp;T Inc. (T) was a net sell after the stock reached a 52-week high during the period as the company reached a multi-year content carriage agreement with Starz. Lam Research Corp. (LRCX) beat on earnings and raised their dividend, and was net sold.\n\nAdditional names sold include Wabtec Corp. (WAB), Dupont de Nemours Inc. (DD), and Siri XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI).\n\nInclusion of specific security names in this commentary does not constitute a recommendation from TD Ameritrade to buy, sell, or hold.\n\n**About the IMX**\n\nThe Investor Movement Index, or the IMX, is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors’ portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.\n\nThe IMX does this by using data including holdings/positions, trading activity, and other data from a sample of our 11 million funded client accounts.\n\nIt’s best to review IMX trends over time, rather than focusing on one month’s score. If a score increases month over month, that likely means that investors are getting more bullish. If a score decreases month over month, that can either mean that investors are becoming bearish, or that they are less bullish than before. There are no defined bullish/bearish thresholds for the index. Scores should be viewed relative to other periods – the more scores you consider, the more likely you are to see trends that can be compared to other indices or market dynamics.\n\nFor example: If the index decreased from one month to the next after hitting a new high, that may be because investors are taking profits and reducing exposure to the market. But relative to other periods, the score is still high – indicating that portfolios are still bullish.\n\nWhile the IMX can help provide insight into individual investor behavior, it cannot predict the direction of the market. It provides a snapshot of what individual investors are currently doing within their portfolios. This snapshot, when viewed over time, can be used to suggest a bullish or bearish sentiment on the part of retail investors.\n\n*Source: TD Ameritrade*\n\n-----\n\nLet me know if this is good information and I can share these on a monthly basis when they're updated.

The central bank hinted at potential action at its October meeting, which will take place almost a month after the sales tax increases to 10.0% from 8.0%.

(MSFT + $3.13 to $141.65) after the software giant announced an 11% increase in its quarterly dividend (from $0.46 to $0.51/share) and approved a new share repurchase program of up to $40B. Separately, Indian movie producer Eros international announced a collaboration to build an online video platform on MSFT’s Azure cloud platform. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:2 with the September 20th 142.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 25,849).  \n\nAlso trading to the upside is Miller Herman Inc. (MLHR + $2.77 to $47.24) after the furniture company reported fiscal Q1 earnings of $0.84 per share ($0.06 beat) on revenue that increased 7.4% year-over-year to $670.9M (above the $661.8M consensus estimate). New orders increased 6.9% while sales and orders increased 7.7% (above the respective +6.0% and 7.7% consensus estimates). The company issued upside guidance as Q2 EPS is expected to come in a range of $0.85-0.89 on revenue of $685-705M (vs. the respective $0.85 and $684.83M consensus estimates). Shares of MLHR hit a 52-week high of $49.40 earlier in the trading session. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 3:1 with the October 18th 50.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 864).\n\nLastly, shares of Twilio Inc. (TWLO + $1.76 to $114.31) are gaining ground after Morgan Stanley upgraded the cloud communications provider to “Overweight” from “Equal-Weight” and bumped their price target to $135.00 from $130.00. Calls are outnumbering puts nearly 3:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the September 20th 115.00 call (volume is 1,557).\n\n \n\nNew 52-week highs (55 new highs today): Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT - $0.18 to $51.91), Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG + $0.17 to $60.99), Sysco Corp. (SYY - $0.10 to $78.76), Vulcan Materials Company (VMC + $1.44 to $150.09)\n\nNotable Call Activity\n\nSome unusual call activity (~8:1 over puts) is being seen in Morgan Stanley Inc. (MS + $0.03 to $44.39) which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 18th 46.00 call. Volume on this contract is 11,931 (vs. open interest of 1,154) which mostly consisted of a 7,248 block that was bought for $1.02 when the bid/ask spread was $0.92 x $1.03. We know this block is a new position based on the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place above the midpoint of the bid/ask spread.  \n\nToday’s Bearish Activity \n\nShares of Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI - $5.79 to $121.34) are gapping down below the 50-day SMA this morning after the operator of Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen restaurants reported fiscal Q1 earnings of $1.38 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.02 beat) on revenue of $2.13B year-over-year (in-line with estimates) as blended same-restaurant sales increased 0.9% year-over-year. Looking ahead, the company reaffirmed full-year 2020 EPS of $6.30-6.45 on revenue of $8.96-9.05B (vs. the respective $6.41 and $9.03B consensus estimates) with same-store sales growth expected to be +1-2%. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 5:2 with the September 20th 120.00 put garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 1,440).\n\nAlso trading to the downside is US Steel Corp. (X - $1.69 to $10.76) after the steel maker lowered guidance last night after the market close. The company said that it expects to report a Q3 adjusted loss of $0.35 per share (worse than the $0.10 loss analysts had modeled) and said it will continue to idle two blast furnaces until the end of the year. Commenting on the outlook the company stated, “The impact of falling steel prices through the second quarter, combined with the impact of a larger than expected drop in scrap prices on market sentiment, is expected to negatively impact flat-rolled earnings in the second half of the year. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the September 20th 10.00 put leading the way (volume is 8,489).  \n\nLastly, shares of Costco Wholesale Co. (COST - $7.40 to $285.03) are under pressure after Bernstein downgraded the warehouse club operator to “Underperform” from “Market-Perform” while increasing their price target to $230.00 from $220.00, citing valuation and potential risks to the pace of growth. Shares of COST are trading roughly 1% above the 50-day SMA (currently $282.33) this morning. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the September 20th 285.00 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 1,551).\n\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (8 new lows today): EZCORP Inc. (EZPW - $0.83 to $7.42), Home Services Inc. (AHPI - $0.05 to $7.15), Viveve Medical Inc. (VIVE - $0.83 to $6.97)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (9:1 over calls) is being seen in Macy’s Inc. (M - $0.25 to $16.02) as option traders primarily target the October 18th 15.00 put. Volume on this contract is 26,824 versus open interest of 5,220, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The majority of the transactions on this contract mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask prices of $0.30 and $0.31, which suggests bearish intent.\n\niShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV + $0.10 to $16.65): Some unusual put activity is being seen on the SLV October 4th 15.50 put as volume is 39,904 versus open interest of 311, so we know this is primarily represents new positioning. Transactions mostly consisted of various-sized blocks (2,828, 2,034, 1,722, 1,020, 1,000 etc.) that were bought at the ask price of $0.04, which suggests bearish intent.\n\nVolume Signals     \n\niShares MSCI Hong Kong ETF (EWH - $0.21 to $23.43): Option volume is running at over 60x the daily average of 955 contracts which is primarily being driven by some block activity out on December 20th expiration:\n\n24.00 put – a 26K block was bought at the ask price of $1.50 (open interest is 28,665)\n23.00 put – a 26K block was simultaneously traded for $1.00 (open interest is 2,944)\nBased on the open interest figures it appears that a previously held short 26K block was rolled down to the 23.00 put, which would suggest that the block trader now believes that EWH will remain above the $23.00 price level instead of a prior view above the $24.00 price level at expiration (which would indicate a slightly less bullish view).\n\nUnited Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI - $0.68 to $12.72): Option volume is running at over 10x the daily average of 1,241 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of fairly large blocks that simultaneously traded out on the February 2020 expiration:\n\n10.00 put – a 5,000 block was bought for $0.80 when the bid/ask spread was $0.65 x $0.85 (open interest is 31)\n5.00 put – a 7,500 block was sold for $0.03 (open interest is 7,604)\nBased on the open interest figures it appears that a previously held long put position was rolled up (from the 5.00 to the 10.00 strike) and decreased in size (from 7,500 to 5,000 contracts), which suggests that the block trader is still bearish on this name, though perhaps not as bearish as when the position was initiated.  \n\nNielsen Holdings PLC (NLSN + $0.22 to $22.96): Today’s option volume is 18,453 (vs. average daily option volume of only 250) and the activity is definitively call-biased. Option traders were primarily targeting two contracts:\n\nFebruary 2020 25.00 call (volume is 12,191 vs. open interest of 35) – transactions mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $1.20   \nNovember 25.00 call (volume is 10,946 vs. open interest of 587) – transactions mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought for $0.70   \nWe know we have mostly new positioning on both of these contracts given the respective open interest figures and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trades mostly consisted of buys.\n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 0.41 to 13.54) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 13.31-14.66) as equity markets are higher around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 82, SPX + 10, COMPX + 38). VIX option volume has been light today at 174,730 contracts (#8 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.48).

Now we're under that dip. Price action very bearish, we could be on the verge of a snap back to 280 now, which may or may not hold this time.\n\nA lot of new headwinds come October but I guess they're already starting to get priced in, the feds repo operations are adding uncertainty to the mix, October will be a big test for the market but I figured we'd manufacture a new ATH before that - just didn't think it'd last only 1hr. Trade war is still negatively affecting things. Even though people became optimistic about it in the short term, it could still escalate further. September was a big month for China when it needed stability, but come October they could stop negotiating. SPY flat for the year and eveyone saying that as a bad thing, but if it's all one big consolidation at 300 then you can see a decent jump up possible if the market sees it that way. But seems like every time we've made a new ATH this year all it provides is a great entry for puts, and it really seems *thats* the way the market sees it currently. Based on the US economy SPY 300 makes sense, based on the global economy 280 makes more sense - really hard to tell where it's going. I thought 300 would be much stronger support than it turned out by to be, and now it seems like support at 298 is the only hope before we risk a snap back to 280 - the original dip off China cancelling talks technically broke 298, which was followed by what seems like a dead cat bounce before 298 broke again right away in after hours and so far (5:30pm) only sinking lower. Monday could be hella red it seems, or we'll manage to recover 298 and possibly 300 into the week to start a march back to ATH?\n\nA slow push towards ATH and holding it this time is the most bullish scenario I think, consolidating there to give investors confidence to buy in at those levels and start pushing new ATHs. It could be possible based on the strength of the US economy and if the perception of numerous global headwinds get better. However, any more negative news would negate that, and perhaps the perception of global headwinds are already too bad and another selloff is imminent. I don't see anything on the horizon that could cause a quick gain. A good brexit wouldn't be enough to outweigh all the other negative headwinds, and that seems like the only positive news on the horizon now. On the other hand there are a bunch of things that could cause a quick drop like China talks falling apart again, Brexit outlook getting worse again, hostility with Iran escalating, the bank liquidity issue scaring people, or a combination of these. I guess if we get great news about a China deal it could cause a nice rally, but I really don't think a deal is anywhere in sight.

About a month ago, I was down to about 28k. Then I decided that all I really needed was one good yolo and I'll be back to green all time. Well SPY was approaching ATH at the time (around 294), so I figured that it was pretty obviously going back down.\n\nMy philosophy is that if you're going to open a position, you need to be confident enough to go all-in. And if you're confident enough to go all-in, then might as well do so. Now it only follows that if you're so confident in a direction, might as well do 1-day expiries to get max tendies. (This is also why I almost exclusively trade SPY, more 1-day expiries). So that's what I did.\n\nWell in the past month SPY broke ATH's again, and I kept losing on my positions (either call credit spreads or puts). I was down to about 1.2k last Thursday. About then I realized I wasn't going to make it back, so I did what anyone else would do in my position: make another deposit. I pulled the last $5k from my savings and dumped it into RH. Friday morning, I was under 4k.\n\nI got bailed out by China cancelling some agriculture visit or some shit which got me back to almost $10k. Call credit spreads expiring Monday got me back to just under $15k. By now I've learned my lesson and set a rule for myself: Don't buy one-day options. So I went long-term and bought puts expiring Friday instead of Wednesday, and also sold some further OTM puts expiring Wednesday as a sort of hedge. Well as we all know, SPY tanked a lot on Tuesday (would've been up to $50k by then without the hedges but oh well). I spammed a bunch of put credit spreads about an hour before close (370 total). I ended the day at about $30k.\n\nSo now it's Wednesday, and I close everything out because it's hard for me to keep track of more than one position (I don't know if I should think uppies or downies when staring at the screen). Closed everything about 36k (the put credit spreads had lost a bit of value). So now I was about back to where I started at before my yoloing. I figured that maybe this is a good time to stop. I remembered some other autist saying costco is gonna be huge in China, so I figured I might as well buy long-term calls for the ER. Ended the day at $40k because of the PPT pump at the end.\n\nWell this morning COST was down 0.6%, and I was actually only down like 5% on the calls overall. Now I looked at SPY, and it was down about 0.5%. In my bearish days I would have seen this as capitulation and go all-in on puts. But I then remembered that being a bear was not very cash money, and that stocks really only go up. So I sold my COST calls went all-in on SPY calls expiring tomorrow. Now this was a flagrant violation of my no 1-day expiry rule, but I figured that since it was a 100% play, it was a reasonable exception. Was down to $26k at one point, but closed for a nice 40% gain at $48k, making me green all-time. Now I'm all-in on iron condors 292/294 and 299/301 expiring tomorrow.\n\nI've learned two big lessons from my plays this past week.\n\n1. Don't self-impose any restrictions - wouldn't have made the gains today if I followed my rules.\n2. Hedging is for pussies - if I didn't hedge by selling OTM puts on Tuesday, I would be about $20k richer now.\n\nNever stop depositing. If you blow up your account, pulling out won't make you the money back. If you lose big, you'll eventually win big. And once you lose enough, you will be able to feel the market, and you stop losing.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.\n\nDisclaimer: [https://xkcd.com/1827/](https://xkcd.com/1827/)"), ('Stocks only go up', 'Stocks only go upBailed on my COST position since SPY dropped too much\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/7vtp85bqfyo31.png'), ('SwaggyStonks Update: The ultimate credit spread finder (like milf hunter, but for theta gang)', 'SwaggyStonks Update: The ultimate credit spread finder (like milf hunter, but for theta gang)Fellow autists, I\'ve been working on a new tool that will finally get you laid. Just kidding, nobody can help with that.\n\nFor those of you that have switched from the glamorous lifestyle of purchasing FDs/weeklies and letting them expire worthless over to team Theta Gang, I bring you my latest tool - the credit spread scanner (like finding your mom on tinder).\n\n# How It Works\n\nHead over to the [SwaggyStonks - Credit Spread Scanner Tool](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocks/credit-spread-scanner)\n\n**Step 1:** Search the ticker you are thinking of selling a spread on and collecting that sweet premium.\n\n\\*Note: Due to some data constraints I normally track "popular" options tickers and those of stocks that have market caps greater than 5B+. I also want to focus on options that have higher liquidity.\n\n\\*Update: I should have almost all tickers searchable within the next 7-10 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 2:** From there you can filter: Expiration Dates, Spread Side (Calls or Puts), and minimum OTM percentage you want to sell (helps refine the data for stocks with high volatility).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Step 3:** Read through the data in the table to help find the "sweet spot" for where you want sell that spread and munch away on theta.\n\n# How to interpret the data\n\nThe data within the cells is broken down into 2 important values:\n\n**1:** The estimated dollar value of the credit you will receive on the spread\\*\\*.\n\n**2:** The Return On Risk (or R.O.R), which is how much the credit is in relation to your TOTAL risk (max loss) of the spread.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe horizontal rows/values on the table are the SHORT leg of the spread. This means you would SELL this option (aka short leg, like your pecker).\n\nThe vertical rows/values on the table are the LONG leg of the spread. This means you would BUY this option (aka the long leg, like the shlong of the dude they told you not to worry about).\n\nThe table values that have an "X" mean that the spread is not valid due to the strike ranges (for calls the long strike can\'t be equal to or less than the short strike and vice-versa for puts).\n\n# How To Use/Example\n\nWe are going to use AAPL as an example here. AAPL\'s Implied Volatility is relatively low, so the premiums aren\'t amazing... But for the sake of the example, we see that AAPL is currently trading at $220.00. We\'ll look to use an expiration about a month out so we can max out on the premium we are collecting. We think it will be HIGHLY unlikely that AAPL breaks $230.00 by October 18 (considering it\'s already had a huge run-up).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the tool we see it\'s possible to simultaneously (meaning at the same time) sell the $230.00 strike calls and buy the $232.50 calls for a CREDIT of $28.00. This means we have $28 dollars in our pockets and can go to Chipotle for lunch 3 times. Here\'s a breakdown of the data:\n\nMAX LOSS (spread width - premium collected) = $250 - $28 = $222\n\nMAX REWARD (the premium we collected) = $28\n\nReturn On Risk (or R.O.R) = MAX REWARD / MAX LOSS = $28 / $222 = 12.61%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, depending how CONFIDENT we are that AAPL will stay below $230 we can increase the SPREAD WIDTH by going down the $230.00 column and purchasing the call option further out. This increases the CREDIT we receive (allowing us to eat chipotle more times), but at the same time increases our MAX LOSS should the position not turn out in our favor (aka Apple sells more phones than expected).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\* I use historical options data (normally day-after data) for the scanner. So do your actual due diligence before entering a position. The tool is meant to be used as a guideline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this tool can help some of you from THETA GANG and potentially find new recruits.

I realize I’m posting this on WSB and that long term is defined as two weeks or longer for most WSB options slangers, so if you are immediately bored just by reading the word “year” I’d highly suggest skipping the rest of this post.  I see no reason for the gold trend to stop, and in the last couple of months the macroeconomic data and central bank policy decisions have all really supported the bull case in my opinion:\n\n- The Eurozone is in trouble, and doesn’t have any interest rate left to cut.\n\nParts of the Eurozone (Germany) already appear to be sliding into recession, and the ECB doesn’t have many tools left besides to print Euros and buy assets, which they have recently started doing.  I think that this central bank philosophy - do whatever it takes to “sustain the expansion” (Jerome Powell’s words, not mine) - is going to lead to a lot more money printing around the world as global growth slows down.  This leads me to point number 2...\n\n- The Fed is practically guaranteed to start printing money soon\n\nJerome Powell has shown his aversion to negative interest rates, but is definitely committed to providing stimulus as necessary to sustain the expansion, and he hinted at the last press conference that the Fed would evaluate “organic” growth of it’s balance sheet in the near term.  There’s a more acute issue, though - the liquidity shortage in the banking system!  The recent repo rate fiasco implies that there is a dollar shortage, which is probably related to the ballooning government deficit.  Sadly, the banking system appears to no longer be able to finance the U.S. government, and something has to give - either the U.S. government starts spending less money, or the Fed monetizes some of the debt to inject some more liquidity into the system.  I think the second option is far more likely. \n\n- Political turmoil is good for gold\n\nThis is the weakest part of the bull case in my opinion, because it’s by far the hardest to predict.  I’ll mention it here for posterity, but I wouldn’t go long based on this alone.\n\nTo sum it up, I think in the next year or two we are going to see a general fiat currency devaluation as central banks start to (or continue to) print money to fight off slowing global growth.  If this thesis is correct it’s going to take time to play out - trading this with short term options is probably impossible.

(MKC + $11.38 to $167.68) after the spice maker reported Q3 earnings of $1.46 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.17 beat) on revenue that rose 0.8% year-over-year to $1.33B (below the $1.34B expected). The company raised full-year 2019 EPS guidance to a range of $5.30-5.35 (from a prior view of $5.20-5.30B), which the company is attributing to a projected adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 20%. Calls are slightly outnumbering puts with the October 18th 170.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 995).   \n\nAlso trading to the upside is ULTA Beauty Inc. (ULTA + $13.30 to $263.95) following news that global superstar and fashion icon Jennifer Lopez will launch her new perfume (Promise) exclusively at ULTA salons in the United States. Shares of ULTA are trading at a one-month high this morning. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 2:1 with the October 4th 270.00 call topping the most actives list (volume is 2,035).\n\nLastly, several stocks are trading to the upside on analyst upgrades/price target increases:\n\nAcadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACAD + $0.98 to $36.97): RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage on the biopharmaceutical company with an “Outperform” rating and put a $60.00 price target on the stock; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:2 with the December 20th 50.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 250).  \nAnalog Devices Inc. (ADI + $1.11 to $112.84): KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded the chipmaker to “Overweight” from “Sector-Weight” and put a $130.00 price target on the stock; calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:2 but the January 2020 95.00 put is the most actively traded contract (volume is 287).\nNational Vision Holdings Inc. (EYE + $0.71 to $24.79): Bank of America/Merrill Lynch upgraded the optical retailer to “Buy” from “Neutral”; option volume is relatively light with the January 2020 20.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 6).  \nVMware Inc. (VMW + $3.96 to $154.02): Wells Fargo upgraded the enterprise software maker to “Outperform” from “Market Perform” and hiked their price target to $180.00 from $140.00, citing optimism over the release of VMware Tanzu along with benefits of recent acquisitions (Bitname, Heptio and Pivotal Software); call volume is dominating (~8:1 over puts) with the October 11th 152.50 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 1,717).\n \n\nNew 52-week highs (57 new highs today): Asbury Automotive Group Inc. (ABG - $0.49 to $101.84), Jack-In-The-Box Inc. (JACK + $1.11 to $92.23), Proofpoint Inc. (PFPT + $2.91 to $131.96), Ross Stores Inc. (ROST + $0.74 to $110.59)\n\nNotable Call Activity\n\nSome unusual call activity (~7:1 over puts) is being seen in Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI - $0.28 to $52.64) as all of the top 10 most actively traded contracts are calls. Option traders were primarily targeting the October 11th 55.00 call as volume is 19,630 versus open interest of 251, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The bulk of the activity on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.47, including a 3,800 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.47, which suggests bullish intent. Note: Earlier this morning Activision announced that Call of Duty: Mobile is now available in all countries and regions where Google Play and App Store are supported with the exception of Mainland China, Vietnam, and Belgium.   \n\nMasco Corp. (MAS + $0.70 to $42.38): Calls are outpacing puts roughly 16:1 which is primarily being driven by activity on the October 18th 44.00 call. Volume on this contract is 5,192 (vs. open interest of 1,490) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at the ask price of $0.55, including a 2,500 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.55 (suggesting bullish intent).  \n\nToday’s Bearish Activity \n\nMoving lower this morning is McDonald’s Corp. (MCD - $5.44 to $209.27) after J.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe lowered his third quarter comparable same-store sales expectation to up 5% from up 6% (vs. the +5.5% consensus estimate). However, Ivankoe reiterated his “Overweight” rating and $230.00 price target on the stock and acknowledged the company’s “otherwise solid underlying fundamentals”. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the October 4th 207.50 put seeing the most action from traders (volume is 1,039).\n\nAlso trading to the downside is Canadian National Railway Inc. (CNI - $2.16 to $87.70) after Stephens downgraded the Canadian railroad operator to “Equal-Weight” and lowered their price target to $97.00 from $100.00. Stephens’ analyst Justin Long cited recent volume underperformance, a “tough” Q4 volume comparison and a more mature model that could make significant cost cuts more difficult. Today’s ~2.5% drop puts CNI below its 200-day Simple Moving Average (currently $88.60) for the first time since February. Puts are outnumbering calls nearly 2:1 with the January 2020 80.00 put leading the way (volume is 50).    \n\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (47 new lows today): Biomarin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (BMRN - $1.47 to $65.93), Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC - $0.97 to $21.96), E-Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC - $7.77 to $35.91), TD Ameritrade Inc. (AMTD - $10.05 to $36.65)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (~8:1 over calls) is being seen in the SPDR Select Sector Utilities ETF (XLU - $0.34 to $64.40) which is primarily being driven by some block activity out on the December 20th expiration:\n\n61.00 put (open interest is 21,525) – A15K block was bought for $0.76 and (separately) a 4,910 block was bought at the ask price of $0.72\n58.00 put (open interest is 5,344) – A15K block was sold at the bid price of $0.35 and (separately) a 4,910 block was sold at the bid price of $0.33\nThe two blocks on each contract (15K &amp; 4,910) were coded as spread trades, but we don’t know whether this was a roll-up (from the 58.00 to the 61.00 strike price) or a 61.00/58.00 bear put spread(s).\n\nVipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS + $0.01 to $8.93): Puts are outpacing calls ~18:1 which is primarily being driven by a 20K block that was bought at the ask price of $0.30 (open interest is 45,071). It’s likely that this is a new position given the open interest figure but we can’t be sure given the open interest figure.\n\nVolume Signals     \n\nApple Inc. (AAPL + $1.55 to $225.50): Apple is no stranger to heavy option volume but 3 out of the top 4 most actively traded option contracts across the board today are AAPL calls that expire at the end of this week as the stock makes a push towards all-time highs (intraday high today is $228.22 vs. all-time high of $233.47):\n\n232.50 call – option volume is 49,653 vs. open interest of 4,463\n230.00 call – option volume is 40,019 vs. open interest of 15,190\n227.50 call – option volume is 34,619 vs. open interest of 16,401\nHalliburton Company (HAL - $0.17 to $18.68): Option volume is running at roughly 5x the daily average of 11,342 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 20.00 call (the #1 most actively traded option contract on the board today). Volume on this contract is 55,327 versus open interest of 7,684, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The majority of the activity on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various times at the ask prices of $0.83, $0.84 and $0.85 which suggests bullish intent.\n\nPG&amp;E Corp. (PCG - $0.06 to $9.94): A 6,725 block was bought on the October 18th 11.00 call at the ask price of $0.72 (open interest of 770). We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price.\n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX + 1.65 to 17.89) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 15.79-18.38) as equity markets are firmly lower around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 260, SPX - 25, COMPX - 54). VIX option volume has been tepid today at 156,502 contracts (#8 on the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.60).

Now, this was a tough thing to do without demolishing Google Drive, so I decided to limit my option choice to just ATM Calls for a pre-determined expiration date, and infer based on that single data point how liquid the option contracts are for that specific stock.\n\nBecause Google Drive doesn\'t allow data whores, I decided to make every stock static EXCEPT AAPL, that way if you wanted, you could copy this sheet into your own personal drive, take the formulas from the AAPL row, and apply them to whatever companies you want.\n\nSheet #2 is just a filter I put together of all stocks that have less than a 10 Cent spread AND stocks that have less than a .10% spread/price ratio.\n\nI know this is a mediocre explanation, and my grammar is trash right now, but it\'s quite late here (When I wrote this) and I just wanted to knock this out while I was thinking about it. If you have any questions, comment them down below and I\'ll try to get back to them.\n\nAlso, the  "Put Mark" column is irrelevant and from a side project I was doing, feel free to delete that, I just want the formula there in case I ever want to continue working on that project.\n\nLink: [Google Sheet Bid Ask Spread](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v4Vfmndqo4AFQ1ul8jeKzE04CrScJodYcm8E7Hs8Rj8/edit?usp=sharing)'), ('Morning Briefing (10/10/2019)', "Morning Briefing (10/10/2019)# Trade talk concerns weigh once again\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 futures currently trade six points, or 0.2%, below fair value in a volatile overnight session.

The indexes got a lift this after a big chunk of this week’s reporters posted better-than-expected results. They were also boosted by improving sentiment around Brexit and U.S.-China trade negotiations.\n*****\n&gt; The all-time highs could be tested as about 120 S&amp;P 500 companies, or around 24%, are scheduled to release their quarterly results in the week ahead. Some of those companies include Caterpillar and Boeing, both of which are expected to report Wednesday before the bell. Amazon, Intel, McDonald’s and Chipotle Mexican Grill are also on deck for the week.\n*****\n&gt; “You’ve got the potential for a combination of things that drive us to new highs,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “At the same time you’re getting better micro data in the earnings, you’re getting better news on the macro hurdles facing us.”\n*****\n&gt; More than 14% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported through Friday, FactSet data shows. Of those companies, 81% posted earnings that beat analyst expectations.\n*****\n&gt; J.P. Morgan Chase’s report on Tuesday sent the stock to an all-time high while Citigroup and Bank of America also got a boost from their earnings releases. Netflix, meanwhile, briefly rallied around 7% Thursday before ending the session up 2.5%. Morgan Stanley advanced 1.5% on earnings. Coca-Cola climbed more than 1% on Friday after releasing its quarterly numbers.\n*****\n&gt; To be sure, the companies are being rated on a very low bar this earnings season. Analysts polled by FactSet expected third-quarter earnings to have fallen by 4.6%.\n*****\n&gt; “Earnings can be a positive catalyst to the extent that expectations are pretty low,” said Dan Russo, chief market strategist at Chaikin Analytics. “The bar has been lowered to the point where companies can jump over it.”\n*****\n&gt; But investors might have a harder time digesting the week’s reports.\n*****\n&gt; Companies such as Caterpillar are heavily affected by the U.S.-China trade war given their exposure to overseas markets. Boeing and Intel also have overseas exposure. Meanwhile, reports from companies such as Amazon, McDonald’s and Chipotle will be heavily scrutinized as investors look for clues on how the consumer is doing.\n*****\n&gt; “Trade frictions and the global economic slowdown have clearly affected 2019 earnings growth thus far,” Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said in a note. “The third-quarter earnings reporting season will likely confirm that those negatives continued to pour over into last quarter’s results.”\n*****\n&gt; The good news for investors is recent trade talks appear to have yielded some progress. President Donald Trump announced Oct. 11 the U.S. and China had reached a “very substantial phase one” deal. Multiple reports this week said China wants additional talks before signing off on the first phase, but National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Thursday there is “a lot of momentum” to finalize the deal.\n*****\n&gt; John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said the “narrative” around trade had gotten “so one-sided to the negative side, there may be a better chance than not that a phase-one deal is signed.”\n*****\n&gt; Meanwhile, preliminary figures on consumer sentiment showed a slight increase in October from September. The final consumer sentiment numbers for the month are scheduled for release on Friday.\n*****\n&gt; “If corporate earnings show signs of resilience, especially by the U.S. consumer, then a run to new highs is by no means out of the question,” Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, said in a note.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/gVBYte1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Y40JTRA.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/al6ZLlK.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Vhun0ZF.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1jE3I6N.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Lel47pa.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/eyhkUlU.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/f5ggNbl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5Q7wyBG.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO\'s for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/MZBU4Yz.png))**\n\n# **Friday\'s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Nfn9SRW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7HJilv5.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/jvFY1ME.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/CN2VMqJ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Calendar Could Have Bulls Smiling\n\n&gt; “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes.” — Mark Twain\n\n&gt; Stocks have continued their surprising strength in October, thanks to a potential thaw in the U.S.-China trade dispute. And remember, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been lower in October during a pre-election year only once since 1987. Additionally, over the past 20 years, October has been the third-best month on average for the S&amp;P 500. October has had a bad rap due to some spectacular crashes, but the truth is the month usually is pretty good for stocks.\n\n&gt; “The calendar could be about to turn into a bull’s best friend, as late October has been when stocks historically started their end-of-year rally,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “No two years are ever the same, and we all remember last year’s sell-off. However, a better than expected earnings season, coupled with positive steps on trade and one more Federal Reserve rate cut this year could allow bulls to smile the rest of 2019.”\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, we are very near the historically strong end of year for equities. Whether you look at the average year or a pre-election year, stocks have tended to deliver an upward bias starting soon.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/calendar-turns-bullish_1-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Buy in October, and Get Yourself Sober\n\n&gt; Folks have become fixated with “Sell In May” but forget to “Buy in October, and Get Yourself Sober.” Our Best Six Months MACD Buy Signal that triggered last Friday, October 11th, initially appears to be timely. Friday’s Alert detailed several trades that were deployed Monday and updated in a follow up Alert on Monday. In addition to the Seasonal Sector ETF trades and the Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy Portfolio trades in DIA, SPY, QQQ and IWM we released a New October Stock Basket yesterday!\n\n&gt; As you can see in the chart below of the S&amp;P 500 the MACD “Buy” indicator trigger in the lower pane, highlighted in the yellow box with the black arrow, came in strong below the zero line. In the upper pane resistance at 3010 still persists. Aside from this resistance technically things look encouraging. We held support last August above 2815 and have been making higher lows since then, riding the 200-day moving average higher. The 50-day moving average has also constructively turned higher.\n\n&gt; As we have been monitoring all year, seasonal patterns for the Pre-Election remain on track, though the October dip came early. Save some truly negative news, the low for the year is likely in. With the market tracking this seasonal pattern so closely all year that suggests the pattern is likely to continue, which means some backing and filing around S&amp;P 3000 through late November before additional new highs toward yearend.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f4ea72981ab6b3772d637d9ba9ec368/d6affddf75c64309-a4/s500x750/86fe12390fff6a9c3a34c91ebc8bde5f06794458.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/0dfb3a34d7bf1e00372cb1c9c297e622/d6affddf75c64309-f4/s500x750/7ca4f05e7343a28ae9f8014db6912e15fc48dcc1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Bonds Bounce Back In Fund Flows Data\n\n&gt; The week ended October 9th saw relatively large inflows into bond funds and relatively large outflows from equity funds. Across all mutual and exchange traded funds, equity flows were in the 7th percentile of all readings since 2013, with outflows of $11.5bn. Of that total, $5.8bn was ETFs, with the lion’s share of equity fund outflows coming from domestic funds. As has so frequently been the case lately, bond funds were the exact opposite situation. Total bond fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs meant $5.8bn of new cash on the week, which is in the 64th percentile of all periods. ETFs were relatively stronger, with bond funds drawing $1.9bn of inflows, higher than more than 81% of periods since 2013. Within both ETF and combined mutual and ETF flows, municipal bonds were the standouts, with total flows in the top 10% of all periods. Since 2013, $152bn has flowed into mutual funds and ETFs that own municipal government bonds, with more than $90bn of that coming since the end of 2017. Those flows are very likely being driven by tax-advantaged buying incentivized by the changes to the tax code at the end of 2017 which ended a variety of popular state and local tax deductions.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101819-Flows.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# ISM Offsides, If Not Utterly Incorrect\n\n&gt; This week’s manufacturing activity releases from the New York Fed and Philly Fed showed a slightly weaker but generally upbeat assessment of economic activity. The numbers from these two regional surveys may not be fully representative of the aggregate national economy, but they’re usually a pretty good indicator. As shown in the chart below, they’ve been a decent guide to what the ISM Manufacturing index says about national activity since the Empire State manufacturing index started its releases in 2001.\n\n&gt; Unlike these two indices, which have shown a general uptick in activity over the last few months, the ISM index shows a different route. But that data isn’t backed up by the average results across the five Fed districts that survey their manufacturers. The size and scale of the divergence is so big that one of these indices is almost certainly wrong, but which?\n\n&gt; For a tiebreaker, Markit’s manufacturing survey suggests conditions are at multi-month highs and picking up, more consistent with the data from Fed surveys than ISM. Markit’s sample size is bigger and the index is more representative of the whole sector than ISM only; with all five regional Fed surveys in the mix, they also have a sample size advantage over ISM. Hard data of late (including manufacturing production, exports, and hiring) has all sided against ISM and is showing data more consistent with the Five Fed or Markit surveys. For now, it looks like the brutal ISM results are a bit overstated.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101819-PMIs.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Nasadaq - One Downtrend Down, Another To Go\n\n&gt; In a post yesterday, we discussed the seemingly never-ending rangebound trading pattern for the STOXX 600. It\'s not just Europe either. Seemingly everywhere you look these days, there\'s a major equity index stuck in some sort of range. The Nasdaq is just one example of many. At a level of around 8,140, the Nasdaq is at the same level it was at exactly six months ago and also all the way back in August of last year.\n\n&gt; Last week at this time, things were looking good for the Nasdaq as the index had bounced off of support at its 200-DMA and broke its short-term downtrend from the September lower high. This week has seen further gains with the Nasdaq rising more than 1%, but that rally looks to have stalled out yesterday right at another downtrend from the July high. A meaningful break of that downtrend would come into play at around 8,200 which is just over half of one percent above current levels. Using our Trend Analyzer tool, of the 100 stocks in the Nasdaq 100, heading into today, 43 were overbought and just five were oversold, so it may take a few days of \'rest\' for the index before a meaningful break of that downtrend can occur.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101819-Nasdaq.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Rangebound on Both Sides of the Atlantic\n\n&gt; Everyone here is well aware of the fact that equities have been stuck in what seems like an endless trading range where the S&amp;P 500 has failed to break out meaningfully to new highs. What some investors may not be of cognizant of is the fact that over in Europe, the benchmark STOXX 600 has also been stuck in a trading range of its own. While the index peaked at higher levels in 2015, it subsequently fell over 25% during the global sell-off in late 2015/early 2016. From those lows, the STOXX rallied more than 30% for the next 15 months. Since May 2017, though, the index has been stuck in a range and unable to meaningfully break out to new highs.\n\n&gt; This year\'s performance for the STOXX 600 has been a continuation of the holding pattern that the index has been stuck in since 2017. Earlier today, it looked as though we were getting close to a breakout as the index hit a 52-week high, but late in the European session equities sold-off nearly 1% from the intraday highs finishing near the lows of the day. Oh well. Maybe tomorrow.\n\n&gt; What bulls in Europe are hoping is that today\'s late-day sell-off isn\'t a repeat of what happened on July 25th. Back then, we saw a similar-looking breakout, but like today, the gains didn\'t hold and the STOXX 600 reversed over 1% and finished near the lows of the day. From the high on the day of that failed breakout in late July to the August lows, the STOXX 600 went on to fall nearly 9%.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/101719-SXXP.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&amp;P 500 Sector Valuations\n\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500\'s trailing 12-month P/E ratio has ticked up to 19.62 recently, which is close to its highest level of the past year. For valuations to stop expanding on any breakout higher for the S&amp;P, we\'ll need to see earnings (the "E" in P/E) keep up with price. That\'s going to be a tough ask for corporate America this quarter, so we may be heading into 2020 with valuations at more concerning levels.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/spxpe.png))**\n\n&gt; Below are one-year charts of P/E ratios for ten S&amp;P 500 sectors. These charts are included in our weekly Sector Snapshot report sent to Bespoke Premium members. Consumer Discretionary has the highest P/E ratio at 24.15 followed by Technology at 23.38. Tech\'s P/E has really jumped a lot recently to new 52-week highs. The Financial sector has the lowest P/E of the major sectors at just 13.27.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/sectorpes1.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/sectorpes2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Open Season For Small Caps\n\n&gt; There’s been chatter for many moons about the under performance of small cap stocks recently. True they have been under performing since the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks hit its all-time high close over a year ago on August 31, 2018. However, the trend of under performance tracks the historical small cap seasonality quite well.\n\n&gt; With the Russell 2000 up a fraction today as the major U.S. large indices were down a bit from our historical seasonal pattern perspective this looks like the beginning of the bottom of small cap under performance and the beginning of the new “Small Effect.”\n\n&gt; As you can see in the accompanying chart the R2K has been tracking the pattern quite well since July and looks like the small fry are coming out of hibernation just in time for small cap stock hunting season.\n\n&gt; See page 110 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019 and page 112 of the soon-to-be released 2020 edition for deep background.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5c723a5c13434a1caa8906d4568f030/0bb3c9caa4ece84b-7d/s500x750/9f9c81ddaca120a3ac21504c5c712a993878ab2b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# October Back on Track – Earnings Season Ramps Up\n\n&gt; After a bumpy start, the market is back on track at the mid-point of October. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are slightly above average at this point in the month compared to the last 21-year historical average.

(BIIB + $79.49 to $303.00): The biotech giant reported Q3 earnings of $9.17 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.95 beat) on revenue that rose 4.7% year-over-year to $3.6B (above the $3.53B expected). Sales of the company’s rare muscle disease drug Spinraza increased to $547M from $468M year-over-year. Concurrent with the earnings release, Biogen said that it plans to seek U.S. regulatory approval for its Alzheimer’s treatment (aducanumab) after conducting new analysis of clinical trials. Option volume is heavy today (5x avg. daily volume of 14K contracts) and put-biased (3:2 over calls) but the October 25th 300.00 call is topping the most actives list (volume is 7,611).\nProcter &amp; Gamble Co. (PG + $5.42 to $124.50): The consumer products company reported fiscal Q1 earnings of $1.37 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.13 beat) on revenue that rose 6.6% year-over-year to $17.8B (above the $17.43B expected) as organic sales increased 7% year-over-year. The company raised full-year 2020 core EPS to a range of +5-10% from +4-9% and revenue guidance to +3-5% from +3-4%. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 5:3 with the October 25th 123.00 call being the most actively traded contract (volume is 5,312).\nSherwin Williams Co. (SHW + $19.58 to $569.99): The paint company reported Q3 earnings of $6.65 per share, ($0.15 beat) on revenue that increased 2.9% year-over-year to $4.87B (above the $4.83B expected). The company issued in-line guidance as full-year 2019 EPS is expected to come in a range of $20.90-21.30 (vs. the $21.07 consensus estimate) with net sales expected to increase by a low single digit vs. FY2018. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the November 15th 550.00 put being the most actively traded contract (volume is 259).\nUnited Technologies Corp. (UTX + $3.27 to $141.50): The aerospace and industrial company reported Q3 earnings of $2.21 per share ($0.18 beat) on revenue that increased 18.1% year-over-year to $19.5B (above the $19.31B expected). Additionally, the company raised full-year 2019 EPS to a range of $8.05-8.15 (from $7.90-8.05) on revenue of $76.0-76.5B (from $75.5-77.0B) while free cash flow is expected to be $5.3-5.7B (from $4.5-5.0B). Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 4:3 with the November 15th 140.00 call seeing the most action from traders (volume is 983).\n \n\nNew 52-week highs (119 new highs today): Apple Inc. (AAPL + $1.16 to $241.67), Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY + $3.06 to $56.26), Dominion Resources Inc. (D + $0.26 to $82.68), Phillips 66 Inc. (PSX + $0.23 to $108.43), Target Corp. (TGT + $0.70 to $114.38)\n\nNotable Call Activity\n\nOption traders appear to be optimistic about Microsoft Corp. (MSFT - $0.23 to $138.20) ahead of the software giant’s fiscal Q1 earnings report which is scheduled to be released after the market close tomorrow. Calls are outpacing puts roughly 5:1 with particular attention going towards the 150.00 call which expires at the end of this week (October 25th). Volume on this contract, which is the highest volume option contract (across all stocks, indexes or ETFs) on the board today, is 70,660 (vs. open interest of 3,356) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought at various ask prices, which suggests bullish intent. Note: MSFT’s all-time high is $142.37 which was hit back on September 19th.\n\nAlso seeing some heavy call activity (~3:1 over puts) is NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA + $1.44 to $197.46) as all of the top 8 most actively traded contracts are calls. The top two most actively traded contracts are the October 25th 200.00 call (volume is 13,023 vs. open interest of 4,521) and 205.00 call (volume is 4,556 vs. open interest of 1,297). Today’s call activity may be technically-driven as shares of NVDA hit $202.53 earlier in the session, which represents the highest price since November 15th, 2018.   \n\nToday’s Bearish Activity \n\nSeveral stocks are trading lower following quarterly earnings results:\n\nHasbro Inc. (HAS - $18.10 to $102.05): The toy maker reported Q3 earnings of $1.84 per share, ($0.33 miss) on revenue the rose 0.3% year-over-year to $1.58B (below the $1.71B analysts had expected). Operating margins in the U.S. and Canada weakened to 21.6% from 24.5% but increased slightly in the International segment (to 12.0% from 11.8%). The company said results were hampered by higher shipping and warehouse costs on toys imported from China (due to the threat of tariffs) as well as softening toy demand (as customers switch to video games). Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 4:3 with the October 25th 103.00 put garnering the most attention from traders (volume is 1,242).\nKimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB - $9.20 to $129.99): The manufacturer of U.S. household and personal care products reported Q3 earnings of $1.84 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.05 beat) on revenue that increased 1.3% year-over-year to $4.64B (below the $4.66B expected). The company issued in-line guidance as full-year 2019 EPS is expected to come in a range of $6.75-6.90 (from $6.65-6.80) and raised organic sales guidance to increase 3-4% from +3%. Shares of KMB are trading roughly 1% above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $128.80 at the time of this writing. Calls and puts are trading roughly even with the April 2020125.00 put leading the way (volume is 409).\nMcDonald’s Corp. (MCD - $6.70 to $203.15): The fast food chain reported Q3 earnings of $2.11 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.10 miss) on revenue that increased 1.1% year-over-year to $5.43B (below the $5.47B expected). U.S. same-store sales growth was +4.8%, below the 5.17% analysts had expected (though global comparable same-store sales of +5.9% was above estimates). Shares of MCD are trading at a four-month low following the results. Calls are outnumbering puts roughly 3:2 but the October 25th 200.00 put is seeing the most action from traders (volume is 4,669).\nTraveler’s Companies Inc. (TRV - $10.56 to $131.35): The insurer reported Q3 earnings of $1.43 per share, excluding non-recurring items ($0.92 miss) on revenue that increased 7.2% year-over-year to $7.57B (above the $7.17B expected). Core return on equity came in at 6.5%, down from 12.0% in the prior year. Today’s ~7% drop puts the stock at a seven-month low and below the 200-day SMA. Puts are outnumbering calls roughly 3:2 with the November 15th 130.00 put leading the way (volume is 995).\n \n\nNew 52-week lows (42 new lows today): Big Lots Inc. (BIG - $0.20 to $20.12), CBS Corp. (CBS - $0.44 to $35.91), Teredata Corp. (TDC - $0.23 to $28.55)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (~3:1 over calls) is being seen in Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER - $1.14 to $30.27) as option traders primarily target the March 2020 25.00 put. Volume on this contract is 6,290 (vs. open interest of 25,041) which nearly entirely consisted of a 6,200 block that was bought at the ask price of $1.80. It’s likely that this block is a new position given the expiration date but we can’t be sure given the open interest figure. From a technical perspective, shares of UBER ran up into resistance at the 50-day SMA (currently $32.28) over the past couple of trading days.  \n\nVolume Signals     \n\niShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF (EUFN + $0.01 to $18.73): Option volume is running at over 27x the daily average of 442 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the January 2020 20.00 call. Volume on this contract is 12,330 (vs. open interest of 749) which mostly consisted of a 6,666 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.15 and (at a later time) a 3,284 block that was bought at the ask price of $0.20. We know both of these blocks are new positions based on the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trades took place at the ask price.  \n\nC H Robinson Worldwide Inc. (CHRW + $1.56 to $88.37): Option volume is running at over 12x the daily average of 510 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the November 15th 87.50 call. Volume on this contract is 3,176 (vs. open interest of 2,027) which mostly consisted of a 2,970 block. We know this block is a new position given the open interest figure and we can assume the intent is bullish in nature since the trade took place at the ask price. The positioning comes ahead of the company’s Q3 earnings report which is scheduled to be released after the market close on October 29th.\n\nGossamer Bio Inc. (GOSS + $0.61 to $17.57): Option volume is running at over 7x the daily average of 1,904 contracts which is primarily being driven by an 8,000 block that was bought for $0.34 when the bid/ask spread was $0.00 x $0.50 (open interest is 13,713). However, since the block size is below open interest we don’t know whether this is a new position or not.\n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 0.26 to 13.74) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 13.74-14.29) as equity markets are mixed around the mid-day mark today (DJI + 104, SPX + 7, COMPX - 5). VIX option volume has been tepid today (currently missing from the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been definitively call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.17). The most actively traded contract is the November 20th 21.00 call as volume is 14,505 versus open interest of 51,245.  \n\nShares of Facebook Inc. (FB - $6.09 to $183.67) are seeing a late-morning sell-off following news that an antitrust probe by U.S. states has expanded to 47 attorneys general and average implied volatility is getting a slight lift as a result (from 33% to the current level of 35%). Topping the most actives list among FB options at the moment is the October 25th 185.00 put (volume is 20,973 vs. open interest of 4,782). Note: the average implied volatility represents an estimated value for a 30-day implied volatility at the current underlying price, based on a curve fit of option implied volatilities.            \n\nChipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG - $20.81 to $830.73): Average implied volatility is at 40% today ahead of the company’s Q3 earnings release after the market close today, which is 4 ticks higher than last quarter’s earnings release heading into the report (~36%), but below the average IV in the prior three quarters (which ranged from 43-50%). CMG’s volume put/call ratio is hovering right around the flat line today (1.01) with the October 25th 800.00 put seeing the most action from traders.'), ('How much damage IV crash does after earnings', "How much damage IV crash does after earningsAsked on options subreddit but they are very serious and don't play earnings I guess (nobody answered) and here we have YOLOers playing earning all day long.\n\nI want to buy TSLA lottery ticket for $100.

[TSLA **-0.42%** ](https://quotes.wsj.com/TSLA?mod=chiclets)is scheduled to release third-quarter earnings after the market closes Wednesday. Here’s what you need to know:\n\n**EARNINGS FORECAST:** Tesla is expected to post an adjusted loss of 46 cents a share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, compared with an adjusted profit of $2.90 a share in the year-prior period. Analysts see Tesla remaining in the red even though Chief Executive Elon Musk told them in July that, after two straight unprofitable quarters, the company would break-even in the three months just ended.\n\n**REVENUE FORECAST:** Tesla sales are expected to slide to $6.43 billion in the quarter, according to FactSet, from $6.82 billion a year earlier. While Tesla delivered a record number of vehicles, about 97,000, the number of high-end Model S sedans and Model X SUVs to go to customers has fallen. Deliveries of those more expensive models were down 37% in the third quarter.\n\n**What to watch:**\n\n**PROFIT UPDATE:** Tesla said it would return to profitability during the year’s last three months, though it would prioritize expanding its production capacity and model lineup over margins. But Mr. Musk sometimes changes his tune, so investors will look for an update on the earnings outlook. Tesla had its first back-to-back quarters of profit to close out last year before returning to losses to begin the year. For now, analysts still see the current quarter as profitable.\n\n**DELIVERIES:** In the previous quarter, Tesla reiterated guidance that it would deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles this year. The surge in vehicle production has been driven by sales of Tesla’s mass-market compact Model 3. Of the roughly 97,000 vehicles Tesla delivered in the third quarter, 79,600 were Model 3 cars. Tesla needs to deliver at least 104,800 vehicles during the current quarter to meet the lower end of its range. Analysts broadly see that as feasible, though any signs Tesla is backing off the total could spook investors. The company delivered almost 250,000 cars in 2018.\n\n**NEW STUFF:** Tesla has lots in the pipeline. The earnings call gives Mr. Musk a platform to provide an update on those initiatives. Tesla has said it would begin production of Model 3 vehicles at a new facility in Shanghai by the end of this year. Tesla has been vague about delivery details and timing, but with less than three months to go some clarity could emerge on the call. Investors also will look for an update on Tesla’s push to bring its Model Y compact SUV to market by next year amid hints it could come early. Tesla also has plans for an all-electric pickup truck with more details due next month.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-headed-for-another-quarterly-loss-what-to-watch-11571824800](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-headed-for-another-quarterly-loss-what-to-watch-11571824800)'), ('Spy symmetrical pattern', "Spy symmetrical patternHighest point of each of the last 3 weeks has been lining up with prior highs from past weeks (within 0.5 point, or 0.2%).\n\nIf the symmetry continues, this week's high will come in slightly above the high of the week of Sept 16th (302.63).\n\nHowever, this pattern most likely means dogshit and you not trade it recklessly.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/sqObcFH"), ('MSFT Earnings Thread', 'MSFT Earnings ThreadPrayers are needed boys.

The company’s stock price is still based on dreams', 'Tesla’s Musk awakens the bulls... The company’s stock price is still based on dreamsA great earnings report from Elon Musk’s Tesla on Wednesday reignited the dreams of Tesla bulls. Before investors get pulled in too fast, slow down. There are other factors at play here.\n\nLet’s explore this with the help of a chart. Please click here for an annotated chart of Tesla TSLA, +14.66%  stock.\n\nNote the following:\n\n• The chart shows the gap up in Tesla stock after the earnings report was released.\n\n• Tesla reported earnings that were better than the consensus and the whisper numbers. Stocks move based on the difference between the whisper numbers and the actual reported earnings and projections.\n\n• Investors should look at the big up move in Tesla stock shown on the chart in the proper context. The proper context is the median move in Tesla stock over the past eight quarters is 7.7%.\n\n• Tesla says it sees positive quarterly free cash flow in the future. This is a huge positive for Tesla stock.\n\n• Tesla sees positive GAAP net income in the future. This is a big positive for Tesla stock.\n\n• Tesla says self-driving “appears to be on track” for year-end release. This is a big positive and if it actually happens, it may give Tesla stock another push up.\n\n• A careful analysis of the earnings shows that Tesla appears to be succeeding at controlling costs. This is a big positive.\n\n• Tesla says its Shanghai Gigafactory is ahead of schedule. This is a positive.\n\n• In spite of all the positives, Tesla’s valuation is highly stretched. This is huge negative.\n\n• Irrespective of how well Tesla does, strong competition is ahead. This is a huge negative.\n\n• The biggest risk to Tesla stock is that someday Wall Street may start valuing Tesla like a car company. In contrast, right now valuation of Tesla stock is based on dreams.\n\n• The chart shows an earlier Arora Report call that in a short squeeze, Tesla stock can quickly move to $300. This is exactly what has happened now. Interestingly this call was made when Tesla stock was in free-fall and trading around $190.\n\n• According to algorithms at The Arora Report, about 60% of the up move in Tesla stock is the result of a short squeeze.\n\n• Going into earnings, the segmented money flow chart that The Arora Report published showed smart-money flows were neutral in Tesla stock, momo (momentum) crowd money flows were mildly positive and short-squeeze flows were extremely positive. Segmented money flows are like an X-ray that show what is happening beneath the surface. To learn about segmented money flows, please see, “Momentum investors are now buying shares of Apple, Amazon and Netflix.”\n\n• So far after the earnings report, there is no smart money buying. It is all about the momo crowd and a short squeeze. This is a negative.\n\n• The chart shows that the prior downtrend in Tesla stock is decisively broken and now Tesla stock is in an uptrend. This is a positive.\n\n• Should you buy Tesla stock right here? Unless you are a very short-term-oriented and experienced trader, keep in mind that as shown on the chart, the resistance zone is not too far away. This is a negative.\n\n• The relative strength index (RSI) shows that the stock is overbought but there is still room to run. This is a positive.\n\n• One of the keys to success in investing is to be brutally honest. Often, some stocks become cult stocks. A characteristic of a cult stock is that it has die-hard believers who stick with the stock no matter what. Tesla is a cult stock with many dreams of a $1,000 stock price.\n\nAsk Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora.\n\n# Dream stock\n\nAt The Arora Report, we attempt to identify change before the crowd does. The premise of our method is that most money with the lowest risk is made by getting ahead of the crowd when change is occurring. We are not afraid of publishing big targets in advance. For example, our Apple AAPL, -0.28% position is long from a price of $18.73. A long time ago, before the 7-for-1 split, The Arora Report was talking about Apple reaching $1,000. At that time most targets were $300-$400. A pre-split $1,000 equates to $142.85. Apple has far exceeded that target and is now trading at $244.40 on that basis as of this writing. Of course, we have been raising Apple targets along the way.\n\n# The current valuation of Tesla is simply too high to make any big targets with a high confidence level at this time. Of course, investors should not underestimate the high risk in Tesla stock.\n\nFor prudent investors, the best way to look at Tesla stock right now is as a trading stock.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-musk-awakens-the-bulls-but-prudent-investors-should-go-slow-2019-10-24?siteid=rss&amp;rss=1](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-musk-awakens-the-bulls-but-prudent-investors-should-go-slow-2019-10-24?siteid=rss&amp;rss=1)'), ("$1764 into $7360. 317% Profit.

This is due to China heavily investing in green energy, which is great. I think this is a huge win as one of the main problem in Tesla\'s manufacturing is the cost of labour.

Economic data was unimpressive, though, as Q3 GDP growth slowed in South Korea and Japan\'s preliminary manufacturing PMI for October slipped further into contraction territory with a reading of 48.5 (prior 48.9). Separately, The Bank of Indonesia cut its key lending rate 25 basis points, as expected, to 5.00%.\n\n* In economic data:\n   * South Korea\'s Q3 GDP +0.4% qtr/qtr (expected +0.5%; last +1.0%)\n   * Japan\'s prelim.

Automaker Daimler is seeing a nice bid after its third quarter report and is helping to lend support, yet Nokia is a major laggard in European action after cutting its outlook for 2019 and 2020. Preliminary manufactuing PMI data for October remained underwhelming.

(SIX - $0.43 to $44.45)\n\nNotable Put Activity\n\nSome unusual put activity (~3:1 over calls) is being seen in UBER Technologies Inc. (UBER + $0.16 to $33.22) which is primarily due to some block activity on two strike prices on the November 15th expiration:\n\n30.00 put (open interest is 11,329): a 1,745 block was bought at the ask price of $1.10 and (later on) a 755 block was bought for $1.07 when the bid/ask spread was $1.00 x $1.10\n25.00 put (open interest is 21,290): a 1,745 block was sold at the bid price of $0.20 and (later on) a 755 block was sold for $0.17 when the bid/ask spread was $0.15 x $0.25\nThese blocks were coded as spread trades but we can’t be sure that they represent new bear put spreads given the respective open interest figures on these contracts. Note: UBER is scheduled to report Q3 earnings on November 4th after the market close so this positioning captures the potential impact of that event.\n\nVolume Signals     \n\nCommunity Health Systems Inc. (CYH - $0.15 to $4.31): Option volume is running at over 250x the daily average of 157 contracts which is primarily being driven by a couple of large blocks that simultaneously traded on the November 15th expiration:\n\n4.50 call (open interest is 0): a 20K block was sold for $0.35 when the bid/ask spread was $0.30 x $0.50\n4.50 put (open interest is 0): an 20K block was sold at an average price of $0.43 (a 12K block was sold for $0.40 and an 8K block was sold for $0.45 at the same time) when the bid/ask spread was $0.40 x $0.60\nWe know these blocks are new positions based on the respective open interest figures and it appears that a short straddle was established for net credit of $0.78 (x 20K contracts x 100 multiplier, excluding commissions) which suggests that the block trader believes that CYH will close in between the lower break-even price of $3.72 and the upper break-even price of $5.28 at expiration. The maximum gain for this strategy would occur if CYH closed exactly at $4.50 at expiration. Note: CYH is scheduled to report Q3 earnings next Tuesday (October 29th) after the market close so this positioning captures the potential impact of this event.\n\nShares of Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo Inc. (PDD + $2.97 to $38.48) are trading at all-time highs and option traders are taking note. Option volume is running at over 7x the daily average of 3,783 contracts and is call-biased (better than 2:1 over puts) with the November 15th 36.00 call topping the most actives list. Volume on this contract is 5,512 (vs. open interest of 6,054) which mostly consisted of various-sized blocks (450, 450, 450, 446, etc.) that were being bought for $2.80. Note: PDD is scheduled to report Q3 earnings on November 20th before the market open.\n\nAimmune Therapeutics Inc. (AIMT + $0.47 to $26.26): Option volume is running at roughly 60x the daily average of 184 contracts which is primarily being driven by activity on the December 20th 30.00 call. Volume on this contract is 9,977 versus open interest of 2,148, so we know that this primarily represents new positioning. The majority of the volume on this contract consisted of various-sized blocks that were being bought for $1.10 and $1.15, which suggests bullish intent.\n\nGauging Volatility\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX - 0.09 to 13.92) has been on both sides of the unchanged line today (intraday range is 13.69-14.34) as equity markets are mixed around the mid-day mark today (DJI - 59, SPX + 2, COMPX + 52). VIX option volume has been tepid today (currently missing from the top 10 most actives list) and the activity has been definitively call-biased (the volume put/call ratio is currently 0.23). The most actively traded contract is the November 20th 20.00 call as volume is 15,568 versus open interest of 138,579.'), ('Same thing gonna happen to TSLA tomorrow?', "Same thing gonna happen to TSLA tomorrow?Now look I'm a bull by nature but biogen went up like 30% and fell a bit the next day.\n\nThis a short opportunity for TSLA? idk my pussy is telling me yes.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 28th, 2019.\n\n# **The Fed and Apple earnings will make or break market’s return to record highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/25/the-fed-could-be-what-makes-or-breaks-the-stock-markets-push-into-record-territory.html)**\n*****\n&gt; Stocks will try in the week ahead to break the all-time highs set earlier in the year as a slew of S&amp;P 500 companies get set to report.\n*****\n&gt; Stock prices are bumping up against their highs, but whether they can burst through and hold gains may, for the near term, depend on what investors hear from Jerome Powell in the week ahead.\n*****\n&gt; In a week stacked with major events, the Fed’s two-day meeting is likely to be the high point. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to make its third quarter point interest rate cut Wednesday afternoon, followed by comments form Fed Chairman Powell. Those comments could be his most important message of the next few months, as investors watch to see whether he holds the door open to future rate cuts, or signals it’s time to pause, as some economists expect.\n*****\n&gt; “Our view is they’ll be done after this. We’re not expecting a cut in December, and we’re not expecting cuts next year. The economy, in my mind, looks like it’s stabilizing, and there should be more evidence of that in the next couple of weeks. focusing on the labor market is the key thing,” said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. If the labor market holds up, expectations for rate cuts should decline. “I do think the dissenters are arguing they shouldn’t be cutting at all.”\n*****\n&gt; But Matus’ view is just one of many on Wall Street. Some economists expect another cut in December, while others expect one or more cuts next year, depending on how they view the economy. Goldman Sachs economists laid out a case where the Fed will clearly signal that it plans to pause after Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; All of this could make for volatility in stocks and bonds, depending on which market view prevails in Powell’s comments. “It’s going to be choppy going into the Fed,” said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance. In the past week, yields were higher with the 10-year Treasury yield touching 1.8% Friday.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 1.2% for the week, ending at 3,022, just below its closing high. On Friday, it briefly traded above the July 26 high of 3,025. The Dow ended the week with a gain of 0.7%, at 26,956, and it remains about 1% below its closing high.\n*****\n&gt; In addition, the earnings calendar remains heavy with about 145 S&amp;P 500 companies releasing earnings, including Alphabet Monday and big oil Exxon Mobil and Chevron Friday. On Wednesday, earnings are expected from Apple, which is setting new highs of its own.\n*****\n&gt; # Big economic reports\n\n&gt; On top of that, November kicks off Friday in what looks to be the most important day for economic data of the new month. Besides the critical monthly employment report, there is the key ISM manufacturing report, expected to show a contraction in manufacturing activity for a third month.\n*****\n&gt; Both reports could be distorted by the GM strike, which is expected to result in an October employment report with fewer than 100,000 jobs. According to Refinitiv, total non farm payrolls are expected to be 90,000, while manufacturing jobs are expected to decline by 50,000. That would include the impact of GM workers, but also the employees of the many suppliers and services that support the car company’s manufacturing operations.\n*****\n&gt; “The jobs number will be big, but the ISM could be bigger. If that turns up, like Markit [PMI] suggested, that could be a big deal,” said Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist James Paulsen. On Thursday, Markit flash PMI manufacturing data for October was higher than expected, and still has not shown a contraction.\n*****\n&gt; “If it turns up, I think that’s to affect a lot of people and how they feel about things. That could take on a whole new dimension of what happens to Wall Street earnings estimates,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; Manufacturing data has dragged, due to the impact of tariffs and the trade war, and some big companies have taken a hit as a result, like Caterpillar which on Wednesday reported weaker than expected earnings and sales. Caterpillar also cut its outlook, in large part due to weakness in China. Caterpillar shares were slammed but on Friday, the stock was bouncing back by 3.5%.\n*****\n&gt; # Stocks at ‘inflection point’\n\n&gt; Quincy Krosby, Prudential Financial’s chief market strategist, said the fact Caterpillar was able to come back at the end of the week was a positive for the market, which she says is now entering the late year seasonal period where stocks typically do well. At the same time, she said news for the market looks like it’s about to get “less bad.”\n*****\n&gt; ″″Less bad’ is not a full fledged agreement with China. Less bad is a truce. It means that Dec. 15 extension in tariffs does not happen,” she said, adding the market appears to be at an inflection point with investors expecting an agreement of some type between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping when they meet in November.\n*****\n&gt; ″‘I’m not bullish. I’m not bearish. I’m optimistic. This market has been led by the defensive sectors. You’re starting to see that move into consumer discretionary. It’s telling you the market is seeing growth, albeit it not stellar growth, but when it gets ‘less bad’ you’re going to see that it’s being reflected in this inflection point in the market,” said said. “We’re seeing a move more and more into the cyclical and growth sectors, and by the way, we’re seeing a steepening of the yield curve.”\n*****\n&gt; The yield curve represents the difference between the yields of two different duration Treasury securities. When the curve inverts, the yield on the shorter duration security, in this case the 2-year has become higher than that of say, the 10-year. That is one part of the curve that was temporarily inverted, and if it stayed inverted it would be a recession warning.\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year has been moving higher, and the 1.80% level will be important if the yield can stay above it.\n*****\n&gt; “If it pushes through 1.80, you’re going to take the inversion out, by the bond market, not the Fed,” Paulsen said. Paulsen said it would be a sign of confidence in the economy if yields can push higher.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed taking a pause may add to that sense. “I think most people think one more cut and done,” he said. “The bigger news will be what [Powell] says in that press conference. He can go pretty off script sometimes.”\n*****\n&gt; # ‘Greater optimsim’ in market\n\n&gt; Paulsen said stocks could be in a good period, and earnings news seems to be already priced in. “The data by and large has been okay. You have earnings that are okay, and there’s no sense of imminent recession. It just seems there’s greater optimism,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; Of the approximately 200 S&amp;P companies that reported by Friday morning, more than 78% have beaten on earnings per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to decline by 2% for the third quarter, based on estimates and results from companies that already reported.\n*****\n&gt; Paulsen said there’s some sense in the market that Brexit will not end in a worst case scenario, but it is something to watch in the week ahead as British lawmakers decide whether to hold an election.\n*****\n&gt; Jack Ablin, chief investment officer with Cresset Wealth Advisors, said he thinks Brexit would be a bigger deal than the trade agreement for the world economy, if it goes poorly, with the U.K. leaving the European Union with no deal. “A no deal Brexit is likely to take 2 percentage points off of British growth...It would take 1% off European growth...I think that’s significant,” Ablin said. “I think investors are underplaying it because it’s so binary. It’s hard to position for a binary outcome. If we get some resolution there, to me, that has the biggest impact for the markets.”\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mMPvzgL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qfH6cuI.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/2Fl3u1U.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/d0KYXSh.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mQYD2ay.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fARcwR4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NPhYaGZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JwfHb1k.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5DjAHjt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aJoKnw0.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3GQMBSo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4zFdNBR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Oj3izCL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/4BShjBk.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy Treat Next Week\n\n&gt; Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 25 years. From the tables below:\n* Dow up 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.4%.\n* S&amp;P up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.5%.\n* NASDAQ up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.7%, median gain 2.3%.\n* Russell 2000 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.2%, median gain 2.5%.\n\n&gt; Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course “Sell in May”. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac that most of the market’s gains are made from October 31 to April 30, while the market goes sideways to down from May through October.\n\n&gt; Since 1950 DJIA is up 7.5% November-April and up only 0.6% May-October. We encouraged folks not to fear Octoberphobia early this month and wait for our MACD Buy Signal which came on October 11. We have been positioning more bullishly since in sector and major U.S. market ETFs and with a new basket of stocks. But the next seven days have been a historically bullish trade.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e1e3780903ab0320558e5b3ae4cafa9/3e97f22823802fb9-ff/s500x750/ffa25c2f95af2a97ef6221e68e45ac6440ef27c7.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa30c86f2cd7f4fcd6d4b1a15e0fab60/3e97f22823802fb9-94/s500x750/c2b10b503a894dc86252e11a5fb6f2cc5d4db968.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eca76e887e3c4186b3c55ca9206185c2/3e97f22823802fb9-da/s500x750/4a107f95210b6c105423dc027eca75dd1adb3059.jpg))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a36c7df7c5263b070c39990b16774d83/3e97f22823802fb9-36/s500x750/e020f6bed981a0daa21ba07242dcdb916340349b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Normally a top month, November has been lackluster in Pre-Election Years\n\n&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.\n\n&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&amp;P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000’s (since 1979).\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef59a01a84a6391160b8624e5d05acf0/795865009b4c2002-94/s400x600/2d11d5ae114446e6162b685da1210ec1c8e83e73.jpg))**\n\n&gt; In pre-election years, November’s performance is noticeably weaker. DJIA has advanced in nine of the last 17 pre-election years since 1950 with an average gain of 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 has been up in 10 of the past 17 pre-election years, also gaining on average a rather paltry 0.3%. Small-caps and techs perform better with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 10 pre-election years, averaging 1.2%. NASDAQ has been up in 7 of the last 12 pre-election year Novembers with an average 0.9% gain. Contributing to pre-election year November’s weaker performance are nasty declines in 1987, 1991 and 2007.\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Rally Is Real. Don’t Let 2018 Spook You\n\n&gt; Understandably folks are apprehensive about the perennial fourth quarter rally this year after the debacle that culminated in the Christmas Eve Crumble in 2018. But the history is clear. The fourth quarter is the best quarter of the year going back to 1949, except for NASDAQ where Q1 leads Q4 by 4.5% to 4.0%, since 1971.\n\n&gt; Historically, the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Election Cycle is the three-quarter span from Q4 Midterm Year through Q2 Pre-Election Year, averaging a gain of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971. Conversely the weakest two-quarter span is Q2-Q3 of the Midterm Year, averaging a loss of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&amp;P 500 since 1949 and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.\n\n&gt; Market action was impacted by some more powerful forces in 2018 that trumped (no pun intended) seasonality. Q2-Q3 was up 9.8% for DJIA, 10.3% for S&amp;P and 13.9% for NASDAQ. Q4 was horrible, down -11.8% for DJIA, -14.0% for S&amp;P and -17.5% for NASDAQ.Q1-Q2 of pre-election year, especially Q1 gained all that back.\n\n&gt; Pre-Election year Q4 is still one of the best quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, ranked 5th, for average gains of 2.6% for DJIA and 3.2% for S&amp;P since 1949 and 5.4% for NASDAQ. Additionally, from the Pre-Election Seasonal Pattern we updated in last Friday’s post, you can see how the market tends to make a high near yearend in the Pre-Election Year. So, save some new unexpected outside event, Q4 Market Magic is expected to impress once again this year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbbf895b45f184b03a00b205d9d5fb01/50dce02940c8c467-9c/s500x750/aa060bb5f968ea0e9de159e18bbf348ab8f21ee0.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2019 May Be One of the Best Years Ever\n\n&gt; “Everything is awesome, when you’re living out a dream.” The Lego Movie\n\n&gt; As the S&amp;P 500 Index continues to flirt with new record highs, something under the surface is taking place that is making 2019 extremely special. Or dare we say, “awesome”.\n\n&gt; First, let’s look back at last year. 2018 was the first year since 1969 in which both the S&amp;P 500 (stocks) and the 10-year Treasury bond (bonds) both finished the year with a negative return. Toss in the fact that gold and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil were both down last year, and it was one of the worst years ever for a diversified portfolio.\n\n&gt; “As bad as last year was for investors, 2019 is a mirror image, with stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil all potentially finishing the year up double digits for the first time in history,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, it has been a great year for stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil. Of course, there are still more than two months to go in 2019, but this year is shaping up to be one of the best years ever for these four important assets.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/great-year-for-assets_1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# An Early Look at Earnings\n\n&gt; We're now in the thick of the Q3 earnings reporting period with 130 companies reporting since just the close last night. As shown in our Earnings Explorer snapshot below, earnings will be in overdrive for the next two weeks before dying down in mid-November.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/explorer.png))**\n\n&gt; Through yesterday's close, 248 companies had reported so far this season, and 75% of them had beaten consensus bottom-line EPS estimates. However, just 63% of stocks have beaten sales estimates, and more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance. In terms of stock price reaction to reports this season, so far investors have seen earnings as relatively bullish as the average stock that has reported has gained 0.60% on its earnings reaction day. Below we show another snapshot from our Earnings Explorer featuring the aggregate results of this season's reports and a list of the stocks that have reacted the most positively to earnings. Four stocks so far have gained more than 20% on their earnings reaction days -- PETS, BIIB, APHA, and LLNW.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsstats.png))**\n\n&gt; We provide clients with a beat-rate monitor on our Earnings Explorer page as well. Below is a chart showing the rolling 3-month EPS and sales beat rates for US companies over the last 5 years. After a dip in the EPS beat rate earlier in the year, we've seen it steadily increase over the last few months up to its current level of 64.46%. That's more than five percentage points above the historical average of 59.37%.\n\n&gt; In terms of sales, 57.87% of companies have beaten top-line estimates over the last 3 months, which is much closer to the historical average than the bottom-line beat rate.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsbeatrate.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Banks - On To The Next Test\n\n&gt; It has been a pretty monumental two weeks for the KBW Bank index. Since the close on 10/8, the index has rallied just under 9% as earnings reports from some of the largest US banks received a warm welcome from Wall Street. The index is now once again testing the top-end of its range, one which it has unsuccessfully tested multiple times in the last year. If you think the repeated tests of 3,000 for the S&amp;P 500 over the last 18 months have been dramatic, the current go around with 103 for the KBW Bank Index has been the sixth such test in the last year! We would also note that prior to last year's fourth quarter downturn, the same level that has been acting as resistance for the KBW Bank index was previously providing support.\n\n&gt; In the case of each prior failed break above 103 for the KBW Bank index, sell-offs of at least 5% (and usually 10%+) followed, but one thing the index has going for it even if the sixth time isn't the charm is that just yesterday it broke above its downtrend that has been in place since early 2018. The group has passed one test at least! From here, if we do see a pullback, that former downtrend line should provide support.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/102319-Banks.png))**\n\n&gt; Turning to the KBW Index's individual components, the table below lists each of the 24 stocks in the index along with how each one has performed since the index's recent low on 10/8 and on a YTD basis (sorted by performance since 10/8). In the slightly more than two weeks since the index's short-term low, every stock in the index is up and up by at least 4%. That's a pretty broad rally!\n\n&gt; Leading the way to the upside, State Street (STT) has rallied nearly 20%, while First Republic (FRC), Northern Trust (NTRS), and Bank of America (BAC) have jumped more than 13%. In the case of STT, the rally of the last two-weeks has also moved the stock into the green on a YTD basis.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/102319-Banks-List.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending October 25th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKLdI1JvVH8))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.27.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S70pZzT9B_o))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

On a related note, the USTR said it is considering extending tariff exemptions on $34 billion of imported Chinese goods that would go into effect Dec. 28. Separately, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she expects growth in Hong Kong to be negative in 2019.

Earnings news has failed to whet their appetite, with oil giant BP and packaging firm Stora Enso among the luminaries weighing on the bourses after reporting results that failed to please investors. The Brexit saga continues with recent news that the Labour Party is now willing to support a Dec. 12 general election knowing that a no-deal Brexit isn\'t in the cards for three months after the EU confirmed an Article 50 extension until January 31.

Underlying optimism that the U.S. and China are reportedly on track with trade deal progress has helped sentiment. On a related note, the USTR said it is considering extending tariff exemptions on $34 billion of imported Chinese goods that would go into effect Dec. 28. Separately, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she expects growth in Hong Kong to be negative in 2019.

Earnings news has failed to whet their appetite, with oil giant BP and packaging firm Stora Enso among the luminaries weighing on the bourses after reporting results that failed to please investors. The Brexit saga continues with recent news that the Labour Party is now willing to support a Dec. 12 general election knowing that a no-deal Brexit isn\'t in the cards for three months after the EU confirmed an Article 50 extension until January 31.

On a related note, the USTR said it is considering extending tariff exemptions on $34 billion of imported Chinese goods that would go into effect Dec. 28.

The Brexit saga continues with recent news that the Labour Party is now willing to support a Dec. 12 general election knowing that a no-deal Brexit isn\'t in the cards for three months after the EU confirmed an Article 50 extension until January 31.

I found out about this subreddit when I explained this plan to a friend and he said it was “some autistic WSB YOLO shit.”\n\nSo I thought I’d share. TL;DR is basically the last paragraph.\n\nPositions: [https://i.imgur.com/SZJ85tT.png](https://i.imgur.com/SZJ85tT.png)\n\nHere\'s the deal. TSLA has been wildly fluctuating between about 180 and 380 for most of the past few years as investors swing between being sure Elon is an unstoppable genius and being unsure of his ability to actually make money. The latter seems to be dependent on three factors: Tesla\'s ability to make cars, maintaining a high margin, and the promise of full self-driving. \n\nThe Tesla factory in Fremont has been steadily increasing production, and the China factory has just begun production. They have stated a target of 500,000 vehicles produced globally in the 12 month period ending June 30, 2020. The Shanghai factory will be able to produce cars much cheaper than the Fremont factory and will help mitigate any tariff issues, making the car cheaper for China, the world\'s largest auto market. Model Y crossover will be available in North America in the summer of 2020 and should be a relatively easy production ramp considering the carryover of Model 3 components and production lines. Crossovers are a huge segment and this vehicle should have plenty of orders, increasing demand well past the current \\~400k/year production rate and closer to the higher rate they should be capable of at the end of 2020. Also, Musk tweeted that the pickup truck will be unveiled later this year, and supposedly they will begin delivering some semi-trucks next year.\n\nMusk is "certain" that Tesla will be "feature complete" on full self-driving this year, and that drivers will be able to use full self-driving around the middle of 2020. This seems like a stretch, and he\'s given dates for this in the past that have come and gone, so, you know, grain of salt.\n\nBut, let\'s be optimistic. Let\'s ask: what is a probable valuation of Tesla if things go very well? Let’s imagine this future: By the end of 2020, they are approaching a million cars per year run rate. Model Y production ramp went well and they’re slowly taking over the huge global crossover market. Cars are flying out of the China factory at impressive gross margins. The solar and battery storage side is pulling in some good money with all those solar roofs and industrial grid solutions that are selling like hotcakes thanks in part to California having an inept power company. Full self-driving still hasn’t hit because Musk was wrong about the timing again, but they have been so aggressive and enough progress has been made that they are the clear leader. Waymo is still fucking around in the desert.\n\nIn January 2021, Tesla will be worth, I don\'t know, $120 Billion. That puts the share price at $666. The new Roadster starts at $200k. But, to get $200k, I need to get more money because taxes. How much do I need? About $350,000. I put my $15,000 into fourteen Jan 2021 calls: four at $350 (yolo) and ten at $440 (YOLO). At $666 per share that gives me $350,000. I did this a few months ago so as of today I’m up $26k. Imma let it ride all the way to my $15k Roadster.'), ("One more for old time's sake.

TL;DR is basically the last paragraph.\n\nPositions: [https://i.imgur.com/SZJ85tT.png](https://i.imgur.com/SZJ85tT.png)\n\nHere\'s the deal. TSLA has been wildly fluctuating between about 180 and 380 for most of the past few years as investors swing between being sure Elon is an unstoppable genius and being unsure of his ability to actually make money. The latter seems to be dependent on three factors: Tesla\'s ability to make cars, maintaining a high margin, and the promise of full self-driving. \n\nThe Tesla factory in Fremont has been steadily increasing production, and the China factory has just begun production. They have stated a target of 500,000 vehicles produced globally in the 12 month period ending June 30, 2020. The Shanghai factory will be able to produce cars much cheaper than the Fremont factory and will help mitigate any tariff issues, making the car cheaper for China, the world\'s largest auto market. Model Y crossover will be available in North America in the summer of 2020 and should be a relatively easy production ramp considering the carryover of Model 3 components and production lines. Crossovers are a huge segment and this vehicle should have plenty of orders, increasing demand well past the current \\~400k/year production rate and closer to the higher rate they should be capable of at the end of 2020. Also, Musk tweeted that the pickup truck will be unveiled later this year, and supposedly they will begin delivering some semi-trucks next year.\n\nMusk is "certain" that Tesla will be "feature complete" on full self-driving this year, and that drivers will be able to use full self-driving around the middle of 2020. This seems like a stretch, and he\'s given dates for this in the past that have come and gone, so, you know, grain of salt.\n\nBut, let\'s be optimistic. Let\'s ask: what is a probable valuation of Tesla if things go very well? Let’s imagine this future: By the end of 2020, they are approaching a million cars per year run rate. Model Y production ramp went well and they’re slowly taking over the huge global crossover market. Cars are flying out of the China factory at impressive gross margins. The solar and battery storage side is pulling in some good money with all those solar roofs and industrial grid solutions that are selling like hotcakes thanks in part to California having an inept power company. Full self-driving still hasn’t hit because Musk was wrong about the timing again, but they have been so aggressive and enough progress has been made that they are the clear leader. Waymo is still fucking around in the desert.\n\nIn January 2021, Tesla will be worth, I don\'t know, $120 Billion. That puts the share price at $666. The new Roadster starts at $200k. But, to get $200k, I need to get more money because taxes. How much do I need? About $350,000. I put my $15,000 into fourteen Jan 2021 calls: four at $350 (yolo) and ten at $440 (YOLO). At $666 per share that gives me $350,000. I did this a few months ago so as of today I’m up $26k. Imma let it ride all the way to my $15k Roadster.'), ("One more for old time's sake.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 4th, 2019.\n\n# **It’s getting to be the best time of year for stocks, and the Dow could soon set a new high  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/the-dow-could-soon-join-other-benchmarks-at-a-record-as-strong-november-seasonality-kicks-in.html)**\n*****\n&gt; As November unfolds, stocks should continue to make gains in one of the best months of the year for the market, and it’s very likely the Dow will soon join other indexes in setting new highs.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq both traded in record territory in the past trading week, boosted by some better economic news, a better-than-expected earnings season, and hopes that trade talks will soon lead to a first-phase deal between the U.S. and China. On Friday, China said it reached a consensus with the U.S. in principle after a phone call among high-level negotiators.\n*****\n&gt; Analysts say stocks could follow the seasonal trends higher, barring problems in trade talks. The market is starting the best three months of the year historically, and it has a few catalysts in the week ahead. There are a number of economic reports, the most important of which will be the ISM services PMI on Tuesday.\n*****\n&gt; Third-quarter earnings season continues, with about 80 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, including media companies Disney and News Corp. and chipmaker Qualcomm.\n*****\n&gt; # Top months ahead for stocks\n&gt; November is the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500, which has been higher two-thirds of the time since World War II with an average 1.3% gain, according to CFRA. As good as November has been, December is even better, and as the No. 1 month, it is up 76% of the time with an average 1.6% gain. November, however, is the month that has seen the most new highs for the S&amp;P, on a percentage basis, according to CFRA.\n*****\n&gt; “Investors likely remain too skeptical on the impact of Brexit, the U.S.-China trade talks and the impeachment hearings. They’re too skeptical that the market can advance,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Many strategists say the efforts by Democrats to impeach Trump is not hurting stock prices currently but it could if there are any developments that would put his re-election in doubt.\n*****\n&gt; “I think November and December are pretty much going to buck the emotional trend right now. The market is telling us it wants to go higher,” Stovall said.\n*****\n&gt; Of the more than 350 S&amp;P companies that have reported earnings, 76% beat earnings estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are down about 0.8% for the quarter, based on companies that have reported already and estimates.\n*****\n&gt; “This will be the 31st consecutive quarter in which actuals exceed estimates, but as much as earnings are coming in better for the quarter, they’re going down in terms of Q4 and 2020. That’s not good,” said Stovall. But he said stocks could be lifted by the end of the trade war, the impact of lowered interest rates and a possible tax cut from the White House.\n*****\n&gt; “I think because the market is doing so well, it might be telling us we’re underestimating forward growth. Prices lead fundamentals,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P and Nasdaq soared into record territory Friday after the October jobs report showed nonfarm payrolls grew by 128,000, much greater than expected. The number was weaker due to the strike against General Motors but not as weak as feared.\n*****\n&gt; The Fed also added to positive sentiment with a rate cut on Wednesday, but the central bank went out of its way to signal a pause in policy.\n*****\n&gt; “The rally is definitely broadening out. The measured move is 3,200 on the S&amp;P 500 by year-end. In the last two sessions, we retested and spent some time above the 3,025 area. Today’s move showed some needed power, after a jobs report that was Goldilocks: It had something for everyone, not too strong to have the Fed as a headwind but strong enough to keep recession fears away,” said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. “Today’s move lends some power to the bulls.”\n*****\n&gt; Redler said Apple’s performance this week was a big boost to sentiment. It ended the week up 3.7%, at a new all-time high, after strong earnings. “Traders love when Apple leads the way,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fourth week in a row, its longest winning streak since March. The S&amp;P ended the week at 3,066, up 1.5% for the week, while the Nasdaq closed at a record 8,386, up 1.7% for the week. The Dow gained 1.4% for the week, lifted by a 301-point bounce Friday. It finished the week at 27,347, 0.2% below its all-time high of 27,398.\n*****\n&gt; Historically, industrials have had the best gains on average in November, going back to 1995. Industrial stocks have been up an average 2.9%, followed by materials, up 2.7%, consumer discretionary, up 2.6% and then technology, up 2.4%, according to CFRA data.\n*****\n&gt; “The cliche thing is everyone is focused on the breakout. I think the key technical event that’s been developing for weeks, it’s really been this rotation toward cyclicals,” said Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat.\n*****\n&gt; He said he expects the Dow to break to new highs soon. “We think the market is strong through year end and well into 2020. We continue to think the market cycle low developed in late 2018. This is the next leg up in the bull market,” he said.\n*****\n&gt; # What are bonds saying?\n&gt; The bond market did not respond in the same way as stocks to the jobs number. Yields were slightly higher Friday but remained near or below the level they were at just prior to the Fed rate cut on Wednesday.\n*****\n&gt; “We’re actually down on the week. That tells you what the bond market thinks about the economic landscape, particularly with the jobs report. I know there’s a lot of enthusiasm about it,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. “The bond market continues to send a very different message than the optimism in the equities market. The pace of job growth is still slowing, and this number is going to get revised multiple times. Everything is pointing to a slowdown in growth.”\n*****\n&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.73% Friday afternoon, and it had been at 1.80% at the end of the prior week.\n*****\n&gt; “I think it’s a bit of moderation from the sell-off we saw last week. The Fed was pretty much in line with what people were expecting,” said Ben Jeffery, a rate strategist at BMO. “I think probably stocks are viewing it as the Fed is comfortable leaving rates on hold, so many recessionary fears are a bit overblown. You could make the argument the bond market is less convinced about that.”\n*****\n&gt; However, Stovall said it’s a positive for stocks when the yield on the 10-year is lower than the yield on the S&amp;P 500, now about 2%.\n*****\n&gt; “I would say another positive for stocks is historically when the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 has exceeded the yield on the 10-year note. The average 12-month return for the S&amp;P has exceeded 22%,” he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fMSMfhh.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Zk6ZCDD.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Ory2tKZ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/vDtIzbr.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY\'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&amp;rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kgoXJ3b.png))**\n\n# **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xE5ngtV.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z6KfVTK.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday\'s close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ohfhFMl.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aw5n74R.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO\'s for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c6iyCwq.png))**\n\n# **Friday\'s Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ZLfqEJs.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4lgiA2G.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PgvRk8F.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/zKsPBmS.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/nnvJEBa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Typical November Trading: First Month of “Best Months”\n\n&gt; November’s long-term track record has been stellar. It is the number one month of the year for S&amp;P 500 since 1950 with an average gain of 1.6%, up 47 times in 69 years. DJIA’s record matches S&amp;P 500, up 47 of 69 with an average gain of 1.6% although November is DJIA’s second best month. NASDAQ also averages a 1.6% gain in November (second best), up 33 times in 48 years (since 1971).\n\n&gt; Over the more recent 21-year period, 1998 to 2018, November’s average performance has remained solid. November has opened well with gains during the first four or five trading days depending on index. From there trading has become rather choppy with gains receding through mid-month before a low around the fourteenth trading day. At which point bullish holiday spirit has kicked in around Thanksgiving propelling all indexes to a strong rally to finish the month.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b9faf85e2a54e356f1c29214261f03fa/bc2631ef216e46d9-31/s500x750/2c6005f0edfe2e0b6025767f1183dd1afd1b3235.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Next Week\'s Economic Indicators - 11/1/19\n\n&gt; It was an extremely busy week for economic data with over 40 releases on the calendar. A vast majority came in either inline or worse relative to expectations or the previous period, while only 27% of releases came in stronger than expected or above the prior reading.\n\n&gt; The Chicago Fed’s National Activity Index was the first release of the week, turning back into negative territory in September. The Dallas Fed’s Manufacturing Activity index was also released on Monday and also missed estimates while shifting negative. The Conference Board’s reading on consumer confidence also softened unexpectedly as the spread between present conditions and expectations widened further. Housing data was somewhat mixed as prices slowed slightly, but pending home sales was much better than expected. Wednesday’s GDP release also came in stronger than expected with solid personal consumption. Core PCE and other inflation indicators like the Employment Cost Index were inline with expectations. Finally, Wednesday also saw the FOMC rate decision which resulted in rated cut another 25 bps, as expected. ADP’s stronger than expected employment data, preceded a solid NFP Report on Friday. Nonfarm Payrolls were expected to show 85K added jobs in the month of October which would have been a substantially weaker number than the 136K increase the prior month. Instead, actual results showed 128K added jobs, which was better than all but the highest of estimates (140K). Another focus on Friday was the Markit and ISM readings on manufacturing. Both were expected to improve from the prior month which they in fact did but by less than estimates were calling for. Markit\'s preliminary PMI was originally showing a stronger reading of 51.5. Instead, the final reading came in at 51.3 which was still the highest reading since April so the report wasn\'t entirely bad. Meanwhile, the ISM index ticked up off of last month\'s reading of 47.8, its lowest levels since June of 2009. This was in part thanks to the readings on new orders and employment improving. Aside from these improvements, ISM\'s indices—unlike Markit—are still showing contraction in the manufacturing space.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-1.png))**\n\n&gt; The economic calendar slows down next week with around half as many releases as this week. Final durable and capital goods data and factory orders will take up the entirety of Monday’s reports. Durable goods orders are not expected to show any change from the preliminary readings, but factory orders are expected to show moderation in September. On Tuesday, we will get the services counterparts to today’s ISM and Markit manufacturing gauges. While both manufacturing readings missed, ISM’s Non-Manufacturing index is anticipated to rise to 53.5. Quarterly mortgage delinquencies and foreclose data will also be out on Tuesday. Wednesday will see more quarterly data with the Q3 preliminary releases of Nonfarm Productivity and Unit Labor costs. Following this week’s weaker Confidence report from the Conference Board, next Friday we will get further clarification on sentiment with the University of Michigan’s preliminary November data.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/11/Eco-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Price-to-Earnings Around the Globe\n\n&gt; Every Wednesday, we release our Global Macro Dashboard, which tracks major data economic and market data points from 23 of the largest global economies. One stat we include is each country\'s P/E ratio for their respective equity markets. India continues to have the highest valuation with a P/E of 26.9. That compares to the US which is now valued at 20.1x earnings and the fifth-highest of the countries tracked. This is also higher than the average P/E for all of these countries which is 17.02. Other countries with notably high valuations include Norway, Germany, and Switzerland. Russia, on the other hand, has by far the lowest valuation of just 6.41, the only country with a P/E in the single digits.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE1.png))**\n\n&gt; Compared to where things stood six months and one year ago, valuations around the globe have collectively risen. The world average now stands at 17.0 versus 16.4 at the end of April and 15.1 last October. While the average multiple has increased, only 60% of the countries tracked have seen valuations increase over the last 6 months while 74% have risen over the past year. Germany\'s P/E has actually risen the most of these having jumped to the third-highest P/E of all countries (22.6). Six months and one year ago, Germany (EWG) actually had a below-average P/E. Multiple expansion can come in the form of higher prices and/or lower earnings, and in the case of Germany, the culprit has been weaker earnings.\n\n&gt; Even though it currently continues to hold the number one spot on the list, multiples in India (INDA) have actually fallen over the past six months from 30.4 down to the current level of 26.9. Given INDA has fallen over 2.5%, this lower valuation makes better sense than the jump in Germany. Similarly, in regards to the US, the ratio rising to over 20 from 19.28 comes is a result of the S&amp;P 500\'s 3% gain as earnings have been pretty flat.\n\n&gt; Compared to one year ago, it is a similar story. As is the case now, Russia and Hong Kong have had the lowest valuations over the past six months and one year, although they have risen in that time. The valuation for most countries have risen over the past year.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-6m.png))**\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-Y.png))**\n\n&gt; Summarizing in the table below, there is a bit of a mixed picture in regards to how P/E ratios have changed with performance over the past half-year and year. One would expect the ratio to increase as equities rise, but that has not necessarily been the universal case. For countries like Norway (ENOR) and Germany (EWG), valuations have risen the most in spite of equity markets that have experienced declines over the past six months (Norway\'s declines being the fourth-worst of the 23 countries) and only modest gains in the past year. On the other hand, Russia (RSX) has the lowest valuation of all countries despite having outperformed dramatically over the last six to twelve months. RSX has also not seen any major surge in valuation in that time as earnings have kept up with prices. Meanwhile, other countries like India (INDA), Switzerland (EWL), Taiwan (EWT) and the US (SPY) have seen this dynamic react more in line with what could be expected.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/PE-table2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Guidance Trends Lower\n\n&gt; Our good friend (and a former boss) Laszlo Birinyi used to hammer home that "it\'s all about the guidance!" when it comes to earnings reports for specific companies. That is indeed very true as investors discount stocks based on forward projections more than what they\'ve done in the past. On the subject of guidance, this season we\'ve been seeing a lot more companies lower guidance than raise guidance, which has resulted in a pretty big tick lower in our guidance spread reading on our Earnings Explorer page (available to Bespoke Institutional members).\n\n&gt; Our guidance spread reading shows the difference between the percentage of companies that have raised guidance and lowered guidance over the last three months on a rolling basis. A positive reading means more companies have raised guidance than lowered guidance over the last three months and vice versa for a negative reading. As you can see, the reading is currently at -6.48 percentage points, which is well below the historical average of -2.97. (It\'s notable that historically the average guidance spread has been negative, which tells us that in general companies like to under-promise and over-deliver.) The guidance spread completely tanked in the first quarter of 2019 before stabilizing and rallying back during the summer. While it hasn\'t been in positive territory all year, the spread did briefly get above its historical average during the Q2 reporting period in July.\n\n&gt; A negative guidance reading means companies are less optimistic about the future than they could be, but it\'s not necessarily a bearish sign for the stock market. If anything, it gives companies an easier chance at beating estimates going forward as long as the economy doesn\'t completely fall off a cliff. As you can see in the second chart below that extends our guidance spread reading all the way back to 2003, the current reading is hardly a negative outlier to be concerned about. The only time the spread really collapsed was in mid to late 2008 in the midst of the Financial Crisis.

Still, GDP increased 2% year over year last quarter, slightly below 2.1% year-over-year average growth since the cycle started in July 2009.\n\n&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/solid-consumer-spending_1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n&gt; The composition of growth last quarter showed U.S. consumers pulled the economy along once again. Consumer spending contributed 1.9 percentage points to the GDP increase during the quarter, while government spending added 0.4 percentage points. Housing contributed 0.2 percentage points, a nice surprise after residential investment dragged on growth for six straight quarters.\n\n&gt; Business spending reduced overall GDP growth by 0.4 percentage points, its biggest drag on growth since the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth in capital expenditures (capex) has stalled as U.S. companies have shelved expansion plans amid a surge in global uncertainty.\n\n&gt; “The economy continues to muddle through at an average pace of growth,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While we’re not surprised to see another dull quarter for capex, we’d like to see business spending eventually pick up this late in the cycle. Higher business spending could provide a boost to productivity, and higher productivity could jumpstart GDP growth.”\n\n&gt; Unfortunately, we don’t expect to see a material increase in capex growth until the United States and China make more significant progress on the trade front. The U.S.-China limited trade deal could provide some lift as tensions thaw, but we think companies may need to see more evidence of a larger compromise before feeling confident enough to spend.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending November 1st, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9rfOCG3orw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 11.3.19**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n&gt;

My Max loss should have been $52 a spread at expiration. I didn't plan on holding to expiration, but my Max loss should have been $208. \n\nWell, Friday Robinhood wouldn't let me close the spreads because they said I lacked the required buying power(which should be impossible) to close the trade. Robinhood also made no attempt to close the trade either to prevent assignment risk. \n\nWhen the market closed Friday, I checked and my account was at $14 with $6 buying power. It stayed that way all day Friday. I checked it Saturday and I suddenly had $414 in my account, but my buying power was now $-121,000 because of options collateral that Robinhood knows I don't have. \n\nIn conclusion, I emailed Robinhood and told them I'm not responsible for this shit. I don't even know how to exercise an option and my poor ass definitely should not be allowed to take on a position with a risk of $122,000."), ('Monetary Policy for WSB - Retard Edition', 'Monetary Policy for WSB - Retard EditionI’ve been seeing a lot more autistic posts than usual about the Fed’s actions in the repo market.

Am I the most retarded WSB member? Is this going to be the single biggest percentage loss in WSB history? Should I legitimately kill myself? Does this not all fall on the risk management department at Robinhood? Guh. \n\n\nEvidence of potential Loss: https://imgur.com/gallery/nffw66k\n\nSo, last week I opened 4 $SPY 299/300/303/304 iron Condors last week for a credit of .48 a piece when my account was at $214. My Max loss should have been $52 a spread at expiration. I didn't plan on holding to expiration, but my Max loss should have been $208. \n\nWell, Friday Robinhood wouldn't let me close the spreads because they said I lacked the required buying power(which should be impossible) to close the trade. Robinhood also made no attempt to close the trade either to prevent assignment risk. \n\nWhen the market closed Friday, I checked and my account was at $14 with $6 buying power. It stayed that way all day Friday. I checked it Saturday and I suddenly had $414 in my account, but my buying power was now $-121,000 because of options collateral that Robinhood knows I don't have. \n\nIn conclusion, I emailed Robinhood and told them I'm not responsible for this shit. I don't even know how to exercise an option and my poor ass definitely should not be allowed to take on a position with a risk of $122,000."), ('Monetary Policy for WSB - Retard Edition', 'Monetary Policy for WSB - Retard EditionI’ve been seeing a lot more autistic posts than usual about the Fed’s actions in the repo market.

That is, yes, your personal risk tolerance. Evidently everyone has their own, showcased by multiple autists that have utilized Robinhood's newly implemented infinite money process. In this post I will briefly list the steps necessary to choose a PRT that works for you! \n\nStep 1: Find a yacht that you'd like to own. This first step is pretty simple - with your newfound wealth, you're going to want a yacht that suits you and your boating needs. Find the price of that yacht. This sum plus any other future major expenses you can think of should be included in your PRT. \n\nStep 2: Leverage your money until you reach this amount! By this point I'm assuming most of you understand the infinite money process, so I won't go in depth here. Simply leverage until you have equity that is at least half the price of the yacht you've chosen plus other expenses you expect to incur at the top 1%. \n\nStep 3: Buy as many AAPL put FD's you can afford. This step is probably the most important. While leveraged (to the tits of course), you're going to want to buy something that is guaranteed to rake in 500-1000% returns, MINIMUM. In case you guys haven't been paying attention, Apple has been showing a lot of weakness (only up around 32% in the past 3 months), so this play should almost be illegal considering how free the money is. You're going to want to buy the closest expiration possible, and at least 5% OTM (preferably more, higher profit!).\n\nStep 4: Profit. \n\nStep 5: Buy your yacht, enjoy! \n\nWell, there it is, WSB. Five simple steps for finding and choosing a personal risk tolerance that works for you and your personal financial goals! Hopefully you all take advantage of Robinhood's free money feature and use it to achieve your wildest dreams.
